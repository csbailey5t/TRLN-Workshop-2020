HOLYOKE

The work of this Branch has consisted
chieﬂy in making arrangements with a lead-
ing veterinarian o-f Holyoke to call for and
care for sick, injured and unwanted animals
of that city. There were 1,202 animals sent
for by the Springﬁeld Hospital ambulance
and brought back, either to be put to sleep
or, where possible, homes found for them.

Ofﬁcers of the Holyoke Branch are:
Arthur Ryan, president, Mrs. William H.
Hubbard, vice-president, Mrs. William E.
Blakely, secretary, Mrs. Robert E. Newcomb,
treasurer.

FROM REPORT OF CHIEF OFFICER

In addition to the regular staff of
Humane Oﬁ‘icers whose members are
located in all the larger cities of the
Commonwealth the Society is also rep—
resented by local agents whose services
are employed whenever and wherever
conditions involving animals call for
summary attention. Rural districts, as
well as urban centers, thereby are re-
ceiving watchful care. It can be rea—
sonably stated that it has been the aim
to extend the inﬂuence and efﬁciency of
the Society in all sections of the State.

A few of the offenses against our
humane statutes during the past year
may be brieﬂy mentioned. A large-
scale cockﬁght was undertaken. Pro—
moters and participants were corralled
and taken to court. Three promoters
paid ﬁnes of $100 each and more than 'a
score of others paid ﬁnes of $10 each
for being present. Eighty-nine birds
were seized and killed by order of the
court. For transporting cattle in a
cruel manner, a defendant was ﬁned
$350; for abandoning 2a horse in the
woods, three offenders paid ﬁnes of $25
each; two offenders were ﬁned $10 each
for abandoning oats; two convictions
for non-feeding of foxes were obtained;
failure to provide adequate shelter for
horses and dogs in about a dozen cases
resulted in ﬁnes ranging from $5 to $25.

Our prosecuting ofﬁcers have re-
sorted to court action only when viola-
tions of the anti—cruelty laws seemed to
justify such course. In their efforts to
secure humane treatment of animals at
all times they have very generally been
upheld by the courts.

Youth and Crime

ACCORDING to reliable statistics,
juvenile crime has increased as
much as ﬁfty per cent in some areas in
the United States since this country
entered the war.

The Massachusetts Child Council re-
cently reported that the rate and serious—
ness of crime among youngsters in the
Commonwealth have increased, and also
noted that public interest in the prob-
lem has multiplied considerably.

Since 1868, when Henry Bergh and
Commodore Gerry successfully inter—
vened in the famous case of the child,
Mary Ellen, great progress has been
made in child protection. In the early
days, the Societies for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children devoted most of their
time to prosecuting offenders who vio—
lated the rights of children, but very
little time was spent on the all-important
rehabilitation program which follows all
court cases.

The Societies for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children still prosecute those
who break the laws enacted for the pro-
tection of children, but such cases are a
minor portion of their work today.
Workers, trained in the social sciences
and with a thorough college background,
staff the progressive societies, like the
Massachusetts Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Children. When chil-
dren come before such groups, the public
may rest assured that every aid and
skill known to social workers are called
into play, and the child in every instance
will receive excellent care and have its
future planned. With an interested pub-
lic backing a carefully-followed plan,
juvenile delinquency should be held to
a m1n1mum.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

War Department (Io-operates

with Fish and Wildlife Service

URING the past year, when Amer-
ica’s armed might grew day by day,
many a citizen deeply interested in wild-
life became concerned over the possible
fate of animals in the refuges, as much

of that land was used for military opera-i

tions. Would the wildlife leave the area
when the big guns began to roar and
airplanes constantly ﬂew close to the
ground, with all machine guns rattling
away? Not according to the observations
of the refuge managers and wardens—-
men close to the scene.

According to an article in the May issue
of American Forests: “Wildlife lands
used for military purposes are not being
devastated and wildlife is not being de-
stroyed, driven out, or seriously dis-

turbed, except in isolated instances. And .

there is expert opinion that military use
in some areas is affording a measure of
wildlife protection due to exclusion of
civilian activities.

“The Fish and Wildlife Service isn’t
alarmed. Nor are the men whose job it
is to manage the refuge areas, as their
observations have clearly shown. They
know, for one thing, that areas of high
wildlife values have been spared. They
know, too, that between the War Depart—
ment and the Fish and Wildlife Service
there exists mutual conﬁdence, a work-
able plan for co-operation.

“On occasion refuge areas desired by
the Army were abandoned when objec-
tions were raised by the wildlife admin-
istrators. On the other hand, the wild-
life people have constantly held in mind
the single purpose of the nation today——
the winning of the war.”

“The Jungle Book” Movie

It should be of real interest to the
thousands of admirers of Kipling’s im-
mortal classic, “The Jungle Book,” to
learn that Mr. Richard C. Craven has
given the picture his unqualiﬁed endorse—
ment.

Mr. Craven is permanently located in
Hollywood, California, where he serves
as Western Regional Director of the
American Humane Association, which
represents all the humane societies in the
country, and through his able hands pass
all motion—picture script-s dealing with
animals. Mr. Craven has performed an
outstanding job in Hollywood, overcoming
terrible obstacles in obtaining the co-
operation of the motion-picture industry.

Now we can see “The Jungle Book” in
the secure knowledge that no cruelty to
animals took place in. ﬁlming the picture.
The whole humane movement is fortu-
nate to have Mr. Craven in Hollywood as
its representative. We know of no other
who could have accomplished what he did.

America’s Dogs

N December 31, 1941, the total num—

ber of dogs in this country was

15,341,336. Of this number, 10,627,970

live with families in rural districts, while

4,713,366 live with families in communi-
ties over 5,000 population.

A study made not so long ago by the
Country Gentleman revealed other inter-
esting facts, these among them: When a
dog’s health needs looking after, the
father of a family will usually take care
of it, in 44.1 per cent of the cases. But
in 38.4 per cent of the families, the
mother will be the ministering angel;
with the son acting as nurse in 22.7 per
cent of the families; and the daughter
in 10 per cent of the families.

Adding up the percentages will total
more than 100 per cent, because in many
families more than one person is respon-
sible for the health of the dog.

When it comes to feeding the dog,
however, the mother takes care of it in
72.9 per cent of the families, the other
family members trailing way behind,
but 15,341,336 dogs in America does not
necessarily imply just that many dog
owners but, rather, 60,000,000 to 65,
000,000 people in dog-owning homes or,
if the reader can stand just one more
detail, one—half of our entire population
live in a home where there is a pet dog.

They Also Serve

The Animal World, ofﬁcial magazine
of the Royal S.P.C.A., London, carries
in its April issue an interesting story
about animals used in the Russian army.
Dogs, for instance, are being used to
drag Soviet wounded back from the
battleﬁeld on little sledges after they have
been found by ﬁrst—aid men.

Alsatians are chieﬂy used for this work
by the Soviet army, but Airedales have
also been found capable. There are also
a number of larger mongrels, always in-
telligent. Soviet war dogs have many
other jobs, but it is readily understand—
able that none is more important than
this new activity, since temperatures are
very low and much depends, for saving
the life of the wounded, on the speed with
which they are taken back to the dress-
ing stations. Few dogs are wounded,
as they move so close to the ground.

There are at the present time nine
veterinary army hospitals in the Moscow
area, and all wounded animals are
promptly transported to one of these in-
stitutions. They are completely equipped
with the latest scientiﬁc instruments.
There are also permanent hospital depart-
ments for the care of civilian horses and
pets. X-ray and physio-therapy units
are maintained in conjunction with clin-
ical laboratories. Mrs. Winston Churchill
is chairman of the British Committee
which. has raised large funds for the aid
of animals in war-torn Europe and Asia.

6. Provide sturdy baskets or carriers for
cats. Do this also for small dogs.

7. Meet sanitary needs by a box of ashes,
sand, sawdust, earth or cut—up newspapers.
8. Keep drinking water available.

9. Provide small supply of canned meat
or ﬁsh for emergency feeding.

CHAPTER V.
Caged Birds

1. Provide small wooden box cage for
canaries. For parrots and other large
birds, use sturdy wicker basket of propor-
tionate size.

2. Remove to safest room in building.

3. Cover cage.

4. Particular attention should be given
to properly ventilated coverings for protec-
tion from weather extremes.

Additional information and assistance can
be obtained from the Massachusetts S. P.
C. A., 180 Longwood Avenue, Boston (T-el.
Longwood 6100) or its branches through-
out the state, working through the agency

Safety.

Truly Thankful
Judy Van der Veer
Oh I am truly thankful

For what I see of peace;
The hens around my dooryard,
The snOWy ducks and geese,

The pond down in the pasture,
The tree that leans to look,
The hills that hide the hunted deer,

The canyon and its brook,

The calt asleep where sun is warm,

The kittens in the hay—

For these and all things like them, Lord,
I’m grateful on this day.

 

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Feb. 191;?

Animal Swimming Champions
W.J.BANKS

E think of ﬁsh as the sea
deellers, birds as air travelers

and “animals” as living on dry
land. But nature has developed many
species of each class which thrive out of
their supposed element.

Thus some ﬁsh spend much time on
land and even skim through the air;
there are birds who cannot ﬂy, or who
are more at home on land or water; and
animals, like the bats, whose powers of
ﬂight are remarkable. There are almost
countless mammals, to say nothing of
reptiles and insects, which are great
swimmers. Many of them descended
from land-dwelling ancestors who were
forced long ages ago to seek refuge in
the water; they have been equipped by
nature for life in the new element.

Some, like the whales and porpoises,
have become entirely aquatic. Fins have
replaced legs. Helpless on land, they
quickly die if stranded.

The walrus, seal and sea-lion are
prominent members of another group of
sea-going mammals. Feeding on marine
life, they may cruise for months in the
open ocean without touching land. Slow
and awkward away from the water, their
legs have become ﬂippers which are more
efﬁcient in swimming than walking.
They are born on the wave—swept rocks
and actually have to learn to swim.

Then comes a large group of animals

which, though less completely adapted to .

marine life and still possessing good
“land legs,” nevertheless spend much of

their time in the water. They are quite
amphibious, at home in two elements.
An outstanding example is the beaver,

as?

THOUGH SPENDING MONTHS WITHOUT TOUCHING LAND, SEA
LIONS CANNOT SWIM AT BIRTH

who sleeps and works on land, ﬁnds his
food there, even makes extensive over~
land journeys.

Mother nature, in furnishing the-
beaver’s equipment for pond life, has
given him webbed hind feet, a rudder—
like tail and a self-oiling waterproof
coat. His ears and nostrils are valvular-
Like the otter, who can catch fast ﬁsh,
he is able to stay submerged for aston—
ishing periods.

The ungainly hippopotamus, like the
crocodile, can lie all day in sluggish-
African rivers with only small bulges
containing eyes and nostrils above the
surface. The hippo possesses the almost
unique ability to control his own buoy—
ancy, ﬂoating like a balloon or sinking
to the bottom like a stone. Competent
observers claim that he can even run
along the bottom of the river.

Of those animals which cannot be
classed as amphibious, and are essenti—
ally land dwellers, many nevertheless
are strong and expert swimmers, often
spending considerable time in the water
by choice. Among North American deer
the huge and awkward-looking moose,
rather surprisingly, is quite at home in
the water.

Moose feed on the tender growth of
the lake and river beds, plunging their
heads far below the surface and throw—
ing their rumps upwards. Moose calves,
when danger threatens, dash into the
water until only their nostrils are show—
ing. Their ears close under water.
Strong—armed canoeists ﬁnd difﬁculty in
overtaking the swimming moose, who
may make six or seven miles per hour.

In all nature few species of animals
or birds are unable to swim, if need be.
Even the barnyard hen can save herself
if she falls into the duck pond and a few
chickens even develop a taste for a

the course of time; but tyrants, as all
history shows, must be destroyed.

To a Hunter

Dorothy E. Jacobs

This was a doe, who kissed

A slender, freckled fawn,

When the eastern sky, pink-tinted,

Told a gray earth it was dawn.
The sun’s gold lances missed
The mountain's pine-clad brink;
Filled cloven hooves, imprinted
Where the deer had paused to drink.

This was a doe, who fled

On slim legs through the gleam

Of sun-bright, silver, shallow

Waters of a stream.
With high-flung, tapered head,
And white brush whisking up;
Startling finch and swallow,
And furry frightened pup.

This is a doe, who lies

On the fender of your car,

With stiff, slim legs extended

That once fled, free and far.
A doe with glassy eyes,
And a bullet in its side . . .
And a starving fawn, untended,
Dies where black wood shadows slide.

Angleworms as Pepper-Uppers
EDITH ELIZABETH FEIGEL

NGLEWORMS—ﬁshing. Or angle-

worms for the young robin family.
That’s the usual association most of us
have in our minds about these lowly little
soil animals. But here is something new
to think about. They tell us that when
you see a robin with his black head
cocked to one side, apparently listening,
he hears the angleworm singing, and
in that way discovers where to ﬁnd him.
And they also say that the earthworm is
a real silviculturist.

The fact is, our scientists tell us that
the earthworm is one of the best workers
we have, in helping trees to grow. That
sounds rather incredible but the angle-
worm really does a very important job.
He fertilizers the ground so it will help
to feed the trees.

Of course we all know that trees need
other things besides water in order to
grow and in turn produce the wood which
is so important to us humans. Trees
need minerals for food and if the ground
contains the right amount of these min—
erals the trees will pump them into their
myriad cells, ﬁbers and leaves, which
eventually make the wood.

Now what part does the angleworm
play in this process? In the ﬁrst place
he makes the soil porous by boring holes
into the ground. This permits the rain to
soak into the ground and be stored to
a depth of six feet or more. It will not
run off, as would be the case if the
ground were hard and not porous. These
same tunnels help to ventilate the soil.

Angleworms consume the leaves of
some of the hardwood trees. They also

draw the leaves into their holes and
there the leaves decay or are digested
and then deposited. Earthworm castings
are said to be one of the richest plant
foods known. The earthworm devours
earth, dead leaves or other decomposing
organic material. It may sound funny——
but the angleworm has a chicken-like
gizzard which pulverizes everything the
worm swallows. Through chemical re-
action this whole process is believed to
aid in breaking up the mineral soil.
When this happens the minerals are
ready for the trees to use for food.

Experiments with plants in jars have
been made and it was found that those
plants which had earthworms or earth-
worm egg—capsules in their soil were
stronger, healthier and twice the size of
the plants without them. It was even
noted that the more luxuriant plants
grown on worm—worked soil were more
or less ignored by pests.

Even farmers are “planting” earth-
worms in gardens and around fruit trees.
Where these earthworms are used they
get better trees, better vegetables, and
better ﬂowers.

Scientists working on this study say
that the angleworms, especially the big
ones, are probably the most important
individuals of the soil animals, in exer-
cising a real inﬂuence on forest soils.
This is especially true in hardwood for—
ests. These earthworms (Lumbricus
terrestris), are the kind you can lure
from their burrows at night.

Join the Jack .London Club, and
help stop the cruelty in training ani-
mals for stage or screen.

FTER a 600-mile ride from the
A Yellow-stone Park twenty-six elk
were unloaded in the stockyards
at Killdeer, North Dakota, by members
of the Town Criers. These animals re—
ceived the best of care, including plenty
of hay and ground feed, for four weeks.
The people of Dunn county are proud
to receive them. This is the only county
in North Dakota which will have elk at
large. It is the ﬁrst county ever to
attempt their restoration to the territory
where their forebears ranged in unfet-
tered abandon 75 years ago.

For four weeks the elk at the stock-
yards were visited by throngs of people,
many of whom had never seen such
animals before.

On March 30, John Mass and his truck
took these elk to the Killdeer Mountains,
eleven miles from the town of Killdeer,
and unloaded them where the battle of
the Killdeer Mountains was fought with
the Indians many years ago. The elk
were given their freedom. Hay was
scattered for a mile, so as to make them
feel at home. They were in excellent
condition and immediately began to
browse only a short distance from the
truck.

The law is very strict regarding pro-
tection of elk. It speciﬁcally provides for
a heavy ﬁne or a year in jail for anyone
killing, shooting at or pursuing any of
the animals, or caught moles-ting them.

This is now the only spot in North
Dakota where elk are harbored and are
roaming at large under this protection.

S. P. C. A. when making your will.

Kittens in Boots
CLARENCE HUFFMAN

YOUNG rural school teacher trudged

down the muddy country road in
the April twilight. On account of the
wretched condition of the highway, he
wore heavy rubber bootsgand carried
his shoes in his hand. It was a raw
day and he quickened his pace, anxious
to reach his home where he could get
thoroughly warm again. The distance
from his school to his father’s home was
several miles and he had gone only one
of them.

Suddenly he heard a series of cries
near a small bridge that he was soon to
cross. They were weak, pathetic cries.
The teacher hurried more quickly than
ever to reach the spot whence the sounds
of distress came.

“Lost animals of some sort!” ﬂashed
through the mind of the teacher.

Pushing through the bushes and high
weeds at the side of the road, he saw
four blue and white objects tumbling
around helplessly in the grass, now and
then falling into a hole and scrambling
out in feeble fashion.

The teacher’s face ﬂushed with indig-
nation. “Kittens!” he ejaculated. “Some-
body has thrown them out to ﬁnd a
home.”

It was a long distance to a farmhouse.
The kittens would starve if left there
by the roadside. They were too little
ever to crawl far enough to ﬁnd food and
shelter. What could he do?

The teacher’s father owned a farm
and there were already three or four
cats at the barn. “There’s always room
for one more,” grinned the young man.

As he looked down at the little crea-
tures, now crawling about his feet and
crying piteously, he thought of his lunch
box. That would hold only one. None
of his coat pockets would hold even one.
The teacher went over to the low con—
crete wall of the bridge. He sat down
upon the wall and pulled off his boots.
On went his shoes, polished so that they
shone. He gave .a low whistle.

“Tough on the shoes to plod through

this mud and water,” he thought. “And
three miles yet to go.”
Then he grinned again. He stooped

and picked up the kittens, putting two
into each boot. Placing his lunch box
under his arm, he grasped a boot in each
hand and started on in the dimming
twilight. A wagon rolled by, going in
the opposite direction, and the farmer
pointed to the boots and yelled above the
rattle of the wheels,

“Why don’t you put them on?”

“Kittens!” the teacher called back, but
he knew the farmer did not understand.

The teacher broke into a loud whistle,
happier than he had been all day. Soon
the kittens would be warm and fed.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

 

TAKING A SUN BATH

Aug. 1942

friends said Popoki’s
parents had a goodly

portion of Chinese
Manx cat in their
heritage. His ears

were short and black
and stuck straight up
from the thick White
fur on his head. His
nose was black too,
and while one side of
his whiskers went up
the other side turned
down, spoiling what
little dignity he might
have had. His eyes
were green and slant-
ing. There were
patches of tan on his
back and he wore tan
shoes on his feet. To
those who love the
pure—bred Angora,
Persian or Siamese,
he might not appear
to be much of a cat.

Popoki had as many
toys as a lot of chil—
dren have. Almost
every night my hus—
band brought home
something new for
him. But, in spite of
all this, he proved to
be quite a “he man.”

 

“Popoki,” Native Hawaiian
LULU FUNK

PW OPOKI” was a “wild” cat. He came

from the Island of Hawaii where
many domestic varieties of animals roam
the lava beds—goats, pigs, dogs and cats.
They are called wild animals, though I
wonder why this word should be applied
to them, for they are quite harmless.
They have simply strayed from their
masters to run free.

My husband went wild boar hunting
there. To my amusement he returned to
Oahu, not with a month’s supply of meat,
but with two little goats and two kittens.
And what’s more he “brought them back
alive,” which is quite a feat when you
consider that they traveled via army
bomber.

We kept the kids for a couple of weeks
but as they were reducing my ferns and
small papaya trees to shreds, we gave
them to Hawaiian friends who had a
larger place for them to romp.

One of the kittens mysteriously disap—
peared but we still had Popoki, so named
because the word means cat in Hawaiian.
We learned from Hawaiian and Chinese
friends that these cats are a mixture of
breeds. Long ago the ships which touched
there had a few cats on board to help
keep down the rat population. Thus
Hawaii not only became a melting pot
of human breeds but of animals, too. Our

The rats made nests
in the cocoanut trees around our house.
They would chew the stems so that the
cocoanuts fell on the roof with a loud
bang and went bouncing noisily off.

“I wish Popoki would clean out those
rats,” my husband remarked one night.

To our surprise when we opened the
back door next morning, we found a
huge rat on the doorstep. Every morning
we looked for Popoki’s victim and, sure
enough, it was always there. I might
add that rats weren’t his only token of
thanks for our hospitality. One morning
I found a good-sized ﬁsh; once, a trouble-
some old minah-bird; and once, a crab
which looked much the worse for wear.

Perhaps it was the fun of the kill
which ﬁnally started Popoki after the
mongoose. It was the killing of these
ugly little animals which brought him
his real glory. The Hawaiian Islands had
been overrun with rats which were
brought in by trading vessels, so the
mongoose was imported to get rid of the
rats. The problem now is to get rid of
the mongoose.

Time came when we were to be sent
back to the mainland. My husband and I
spoke of shipping Popoki home on the
boat. We were swamped with protests.
Where would Popoki ﬁnd a rat or a mon-
goose in a city apartment?

Far off in the Paradise of the Paciﬁc
Popoki still roams. Friends write that he
is healthy and happy and still carrying
on his benevolent work.

The Birds and the Squirrel
CHARLES A. DREW

AST Christmas I was given a bird—

box. It is just outside my window.
When the ground is covered with snow
I enjoy seeing the birds come for their
food; but a diﬁerence has arisen between
the birds and a squirrel.

The birds say that the squirrel mo-
nopolizes their bird-box; that he is like
the boy who took after both of his par-
ents. His father ate very fast, and his
mother ate a long time. The birds com—
plain that they can’t get a bill in edge-
wise; and when at length the squirrel
leaves, he doesn’t leave anything but
their empty bird—box.

The squirrel says the birds needn’t
plume themselves, and talk about their
bird—box, because it’s just a feed-box,
and mainly for him. He says birds don’t
stand as well in creation as he does, be-
cause they only have two legs while he
has four; and he claims
he can beat a bird run-
ning up a tree, or along
the top of a stone wall
any time.

The birds say the
squirrel has no wings;
can’t get above the
tree-tops, but they can
soar above the clouds.
They say this shows
they occupy a higher
plane in creation than
the squirrel, and he
should go back into the
dense woods Where he
belongs.

The squirrel: “I

OUR'DUMB

don’t take big mouth-
fuls as the birds do.
I should think they
would get choked in
their esophagus. I
admit I eat slowly.
I don’t approve of
eating rapidly and
without paws. Fast
eating causes indi-
gestion, heartburn,
stomach-ache, dys-
pepsia, gastritis,
lumbago, rheuma-
tism, neuritis, sleep—
lessness, sciatica and
loss of appetite.”
The birds: “Myll
That’s the longest
tale everll You’d

know it came from
a squirrel.”

Well, that is the situation. I like both
squirrels and birds, and am arranging
two dining rooms for them; then all will
be harmony.

For Humane Day in Schools

Schools everywhere are urged to ob-
serve a Humane Day, with appropriate
exercises, as near Be Kind to Animals
Week (April 20-25) as possible. Be—
cause of vacation during that week, the
Superintendent of Schools of Boston has
designated Friday, April 17, as the Day
to be observed in Boston and has sent
an ofﬁcial appeal for its recognition to
all masters of elementary schools in the
city. As usual, the Massachusetts
S. P. C. A. will distribute copies of a
new edition of “Humane Exercises,”
containing poems for recitation, short
prose selections, subjects for composi—
tion, etc., to all elementary teachers,
above the second grade, in the state.
Samples of this pamphlet, which is
priced in quantities at $1.50 per 100
copies, will be sent free to any address.
The Society also publishes a long list
of helpful literature, including eight
short plays. (See price list on inside

HUNGRY BLACK-THROATED GREEN WARBLERS

Figures Prove a Robin’s
Worth
VINCENT ElDWlAR~DS

NCE upon a time an ornithologist

thought he would sit down and
ﬁgure out how many bugs and worms a
pair of robins destroyed in their lifetime.
When he had ﬁnished, the ﬁgure quite
took his breath away.

From study and observation he knew
that a pair of these birds eat two worms
or insects every minute all summer long.
He assumed that the robins would begin
their search for the early worm at 5 in
the morning, and wouldn’t step till 5 in
the afternoon. That made 12 hours of 60
minutes each or a total of 720 minutes.
Multiplied by 2, that ﬁgured at 1,440
worms a day for the pair of birds, Not
a bad day’s work!

But the robins are with us here in the
North for at least four months of the
year. Suppose we call each month 30 days.
So now the ornithologist’s problem in
multiplication reads: 4 x 30 x 1,440 = ?
The answer is 172,800. This is the num-
ber of insects or worms a pair of robins
make way with in a single year.

Still, the expert’s ﬁgures weren’t com-
plete. Unless they are killed off by their
enemies, robins live for ﬁfteen summers
on an average. Therefore, it was neces-
sary for the ornithologist to multiply
his last huge product by 15. The result
was the staggering total of 2,592,000
bugs and worms which two robins kill in
their lifetime!

The farmer certainly needs protectors
like these. You might almost call such a
bird the farmer’s private detective.
“Never Kill a Robin” ought to be a
country-wide slogan.

WHITE HOLLAND TURKEY

Meet Mr. Turkey ‘

WILLIAM C. BOLAND

E’S the noblest game bird in all the
world. He struts about proudly
and is continually preening his plumage
in self-conscious vanity. He’s a grand

old fellow and typically American. That’s
Mr. Turkey.

Ever since his featured appearance at
our ﬁrst Thanksgiving Day table back in
1621, the turkey has been held in high
esteem by all Americans. He is so cheer-
fully symbolic of American folkways, in
fact, that Benjamin Franklin once pro-
posed him for our national bird.

The turkey which graces our Thanks—
giving Day table today is not the wild
turkey upon which the Pilgrims and In—

OUR DUM’B ANIMALS

dians ﬁrst feasted.
The present bird is
a domesticated off-
spring of the eastern
wild turkey.

The general sup-
position is that this
bird is named turkey
because it may have
had its origin in the
country of Turkey.
However, the name
is in all probability
derived from its call
of “turk-turk-turk.”
The bird was ﬁrst
bred and domesti-
cated by the ancient
Incas and Aztecs and
was introduced into
Europe by Vasco de
Gama over four hun-
dred years ago.

The turkey is a beautiful big bird. He
wears a ﬁne, heavy plumage and has a
long, fan-shaped tail. He is quite proud
of the coat nature gave him and does not
hesitate to show it off.

Mr. Turkey and his mate take great
care of their young. The eight to ﬁfteen
eggs hatched by the female are laid
in a hole, scooped in the ground, which
has been lined with leaves. Such holes
are usually made behind some natural
camouﬂage, such as a tree or bush. This
is done to protect the nest from prowling
strangers. Sometimes several mothers
use the same nest.

The ﬁne ﬂavor of the wild turkey!
That is possible because this bird’s diet
consists chieﬂy of berries, seeds, and
grains.

Although this bird did not supplant

JACK LONDON

The hunting season is on. It is the
open season for slaughter. How many
hunters would sally forth with their guns
if the various kinds of game also carried
guns? But that would only be fair play.

True nature lovers advocate game pro-
tection because they revere wildlife and
want birds and animals to increase their
numbers. They desire furred and feath-
ered creatures to live in contentment
with complete freedom from molestation.

It gives us great pleasure to present this‘volume on behalf of the above Societies.

The Massachusetts S. P. C. A. is greatly in need of funds for the extension of its general work,
especially throughout the country districts of the state where cruelty exists to a degree greater even
than m the cities, particularly in the failure properly to feed and house domestic animals.

. The reader’s attention is particularly called to the work of the Angell Memorial Animal
Hospital and Dispensary, opened March 1, 1915. A branch of this institution was opened at
53-57 Bliss Street, Springfield, Mass., in December, 1931, and a Clinic at Attleboro, in Octo-

Women’s Auxiliaries

We should be ungrateful if we did not
record our sincere appreciation of the
Women’s Auxiliaries of the State which
have done so much to help us in various
ways.

The Springﬁeld Auxiliary, associated
with our Springﬁeld Hospital, has raised
many thousands of dollars for the Hos—
pital, furnishing needed equipment in spe—
cial instances and winning a host of
friends for the Society. Its ofﬁcers are:
Mrs. Carlton H. Garinger, president, Mrs.
Walter J. Dubon, ﬁrst vice-president,
Mrs. Robert J. Miller, second vice-presi-
dent, Mrs. Harry B. Ellis, recording sec-
retary, Mrs. A. Mayo Fisk, correspond-
ing secretary, Mrs. Richard A. Booth,
treasurer.

Also, the Winchester Auxiliary has
sponsored our Shelter in that town, and
aided through their treasury in making it
a genuine service to the community. Its
ofﬁcers are: Mrs. Richard S. Taylor,
president, Mrs. John Hamilton Clarke,
treasurer; Arthur H. Bryer, local agent.

So also in Northampton a group of ﬁne
women are meeting the need of caring
for lost, stray and unwanted small ani-
mals, and so relieving our Springﬁeld
ofﬁcer of answering some of the calls that
would otherwise have been made upon
him. Its ofﬁcers are: Miss Emily Hale,
president, Miss Mildred Moulton, treas-
urer.

To the Great Barrington Branch,
working with and through our Pittsﬁeld
ofﬁcer, we are also indebted for its inter-
est and co-operation. Its ofﬁcers are:
Mrs. Robert Magruder, president; Mrs.
Donald Worthington, treasurer.

The Boston Hospital acknowledges
gratefully its debt to the Women’s Work
Committee of Greater Boston for the
loyal, unfailing and helpful service ren~
dered in providing gauze sponges and
other operating drapes. Mrs. George D.
Colpas is chairman of the committee.

Treasurer’s Report

The receipts of the Massachusetts
S. P. C. A. from all sources for the year
1941 were $367,798.68. The total pay—
ments were $386,840.71, not including de-
preciation, showing an actual deﬁcit of
$19,042.03.

It should be said also that from the
Society’s invested funds not more than
sixty—one per cent of the total annual
expenses is received. The balance must
be secured through letters to the Society’s
members and to others who may be in-
terested, and through such appeals as we
are able to make from time to time. Be-
quests are, wherever possible, turned over
to the Trustees and made part of the
Society’s invested funds.

The day when friends of the Society
were able to leave large bequests is prac-

OUR 'DUMB

tically gone. Taxes on incomes are be—
coming constantly higher, making im—
possible large and generous bequests to
all charitable organizations.

The receipts and expenses of our two
Hospitals, the Angell Memorial Animal
Hospital in Boston and the Hospital in
Springﬁeld, show, in part, a reason for
the deﬁcit. The total receipts for the two
Hospitals were $131,963.06; total ex-
penses $173,592.61, showing a deﬁcit of
$41,629.55. $28,285.03 was also spent in
necessary alterations for the two Hospi—
tals.

We are deeply grateful to those loyal
and generous friends whose contribu—
tions have made possible what our two
Societies have been able to accomplish
during the years of their history. Some
of these are friends of long standing,
some of them sons and daughters of
those who made possible these organi-
zations; and not least are we grateful
to those new members who in recent
years have come to our support with
their welcome gifts.

Three Unusual Pets—Not of a Kind

LEROY E. FESS

THIS barnyard triumvirate—a dog, a sheep and a

rooster—literally dog the footsteps of Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph A. Prime of North Collins, N. Y., every time they
leave their home without their car, which is now fre-
quent in these days of tire conservation.

The three follow their masters in Indian ﬁle along the
sidewalk—the dog, then the sheep, and the Plymouth Rock
closing in the rear, unless it sees ﬁt to perch on the woolly
back of the sheep and hitch a ride. They use horse sense
in waiting for trafﬁc and sit patiently in front of stores
while the Primes shop.

Last summer “Rover,” the dog, had a litter of puppies,
one of which was given to Mr. Prime’s father who lives
a mile or so away.

Now, once a week as regularly as clockwork, the dog
and sheep pay a visit to the canine offspring. They stay
for a few minutes, then trot blithely home. Rover on
more than one occasion has protected the sheep from
attacks by other dogs.

A Note of Thanks
MARY WILDER PEASE

We thank you, children, for the crumbs
You scattered on the snow,

The berries that we hoped to ﬁnd
Were buried deep you know.

We thank you for the tempting grain
Spread on your window-sill,

Where every hungry bird could come
And rest, and eat his fill.

We thank you for the kindly thought
That made our need your care,

And now that spring has come again
We hope to do our share.

We’ll try to keep your garden plot
From grubs and insects free,
And so help you to win the War—-

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Golden-Throated Martens

WILLIAM MacMILLAN

of course, but because of that slash

of gold under the throat they could
quite correctly be called golden-throated
martens.

The graceful little creatures are, be-
yond all comparison, the loveliest of
American fur-bearing animals. Just a
triﬂe larger than mink, and quite a bit
smaller than ﬁsher, they are covered
with dark brown fur of exquisite tex—
ture, and ﬂecked with gold at the throat.
Their faces are sharp and triangular,
their legs short and powerful, and their
tails amazingly bushy.

Golden—throated martens are not com-
mon in frequented places. In spite of
the fact that thousands of the gorgeous
little creatures still roam the woods, re-
markably few people have ever actually
set eyes on one.

One reason for this is undoubtedly
the martens’ retiring nature, as far as
humans are concerned. The minute their
supersensitive nostrils pick up an alien
scent they melt, swiftly and soundlessly,
into the shadows.

Years and years ago, before anything
very deﬁnite was known about these
gorgeously-furred animals, they were
classed, rather vaguely, with the weasels.
Why this should have been done is hard
to understand. While it is true that
their twenty-four inch bodies are some-
what weasel-like in their undulations,
the resemblance ends there. They have
little in common with them and lack their
strong musk.

There are no animals in the woods
more versatile than these golden-throated
martens. Fitted with exceptionally sharp

THEY’RE commonly known as sables,

claws that cut deep into the bark, they
are as much at home in the tree-tops as

they are on the ground, and frequently '

travel long distances in a single night.

One never hears a marten move. He
just seems to ﬂow, touching the ground
so lightly nothing, not even a leaf, is
disturbed.

For some reason or another, as yet
beyond the pale of human understand-
ing, these golden—throated martens are
subject, from time to time, to “spells,”
when they quit their familiar haunts
and scatter to the winds.

Bees Busier than Ever

Many bees are having to work over-
time these days, too. By shipping bees
to southern California after a short rest
in winter, then bringing them north-
ward, gradually, as t’he blossoming
orange, clover, alfalfa and buckwheat
comes on, a well—managed colony will
produce ﬁve times the average of a
stationary colony. .

Bees are, surely, the most useful of
insects. T‘hey pollinate apples, pears,
plums, cherries and other fruits. They
produce honey used in baking, candy,
medicines, chocolate, fountain—syrups
and the like. Then, there is beeswax, a
by-product, used in candles and cos-
metics; and by the Navy in waterproof
coatings for shells, guns and aircraft.

CARRIE BEHRMAN
In the Heian Epoch, in Japan, dogs
were called by human names and were
given ofﬁcial titles. Religious services

were performed at their death.

Simian Logic

Linda Boone Saxon

An old Malayan monkey
Sat upon a limb,

And contemplated bullets
Speeding under him.

He studied group behavior—
Twenty-thousand strong—

Then said, ”That fellow Darwin
Must have figured wrong;

It couldn’t be our family
Man’s descended from—

An evolutionary ape
Wouldn’t act that dumb!"

Proverbs That Honor Animals

JASPER B. SINCLAIR

UR four-footed friends have inspired

their share of proverbs and folk

sayings from the classic days of Greece
right down to modern times.

It is useless to attempt to trace the
source of most proverbs, of course. They
are seemingly timeless in their origin
and have been translated into so many
tongues that their original sources defy
all research. It is enough to know that
they pay universal tribute to the animal
world.

“You can lead a horse to water, but
you can’t make it drink,” is one of the
favorite proverbs inspired by equines.
Dogs are represented by such familiar
proverbs as “Let sleeping dogs lie” and
“Barking dogs don’t bite.”

Even the pig has its day in the peren-
nial reminder that “You can’t make a
silk purse out of a sow’s ear”—a bit of
advice that too often goes unheeded.

“A cat can look at a queen” is an age-
less token of feline equality and com—
placency, while “the lion’s share” will
suggest the old fable about the king of
the jungle.

Another jungle cat is remembered in
the question, “Can the leopard change its
spots?” Still another of the old—time
sayings refers to “A wolf in sheep’s
clothing.”

Without being mentioned by name,
the tortoise is the inspiration for the re-
minder that “The race is not always to
the swift.” It came, of course, from
Childhood’s fable about the tortoise and
the hare.

“Like a bull in a china shop” may not
be a proverb, but it has been translated
into so many languages that by this
time it can at least be accepted as a
folk saying of uncertain origin.

A doctor and a lawyer were found to
be in a bitter dispute. The doctor was
heard to say, “A little bird told me what
kind of lawyer you are—‘Cheep, cheep’.”
To which the lawyer retorted, “Well, a
little duck told me what kind of doctor

you are.”

Trained Animal Acts

Trained animal acts are coming back,
according to Mrs. Frederick Bertram,
executive secretary of the Bergen County
Society for Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, Tenaﬂy, New Jersey, but are
receiving the careful interest of humane
organizations. Close to a million mem—
bers of our Jack London Club have
accomplished much toward eliminating
cruelty to animals by protesting and re—
fusing to witness any act involving
trained animals; but much remains to be
done. Mrs. Bertram and her faithful
workers are a real help in the cause of
animal protection.

1. Question: My wife received a fe-
male puppy as a present. The puppy
1S now four months old. How soon may
she be spayed?

Answer: Dogs seem to Show the least
discomfort, and the operation is easiest
to perform, when they are between ﬁve
and Six months of age. This is before
their ﬁrst estral period, and there is
much less Shock encountered.

2. Question: We have a canary about
ﬁve years old. Recently he has been act-v
ing as though one of his feet were sore.
When sitting on his perch he holds the
right foot up most of the time. Around
the toes and bottom of the foot there are
tiny scales or crusts and he keeps pick-

ing at them with his beak. Can anything

be done for this?

Answer: Often painting the foot daily
With cod liver oil will hasten the removal
of these crusts and heal the foot. The
Oil may be applied with a small brush or
cotton swab. Make sure the perches are
very clean and smooth and not too small
or large for comfortable perching. Some
bird owners wrap an extra perch with
soft cloth and soak it with cod liver oil.
This is put in the cage for an hour or
so each day. If you use this method be
sure there are no loose ravelings that
can catch the bird’s toes.

3. Question: We live in the country
and during the summer we have many
birds that nest near the house. This year
we have a cat and are very much afraid
it will bother the birds. AS we are very
fond of both birds and cat we feel we
cannot do without the company of either.

Is there any way to train a cat to leave
birds alone?

Answer: It is a cat’s instinct to try to
catch any small thing that moves. There
is no practical method of thwarting na-
ture. As it is unkind to conﬁne cats in
the country Where there is ample oppor-
tunity for them to roam, about the only
thing you can do is to maintain a con—
stant vigil for the birds. Trees in which
there are nests may be protected by Wire
guards that prevent a cat from climbing
up the trunk. Nesting birds are upset
by feline Visitors even though cats sel-
dom rob nests.

A recent survey in Oklahoma showed
that from a group of eighty-four cats
examined, their diet consisted of ap—
proximately 4% of birds. These cats
represented a cross section of the stray
cat population from residential, non—resi-
dential and Wildlife refuge sections.
Their stomach contents were examined
and the above ﬁgure was obtained. This
information is not in answer to your
question, but is a bit of information
in defense of the cat in regard to its
predatory habits around Wildlife.

Let “Spider” Do It
G. A. TIBBANS

IT’S not at all unusual to ﬁnd a dog that brings in the

paper, brings his master’s slippers or pipe, etc.,
but “Spider,” a collie owned by Mrs. Briney Thompson,
of Fort Pierre, S. D., does all those things and many
more. Among them, Spider, who is now nine years of
age, brings in the-wood each evening and places it
neatly in the wood-box (see picture where he is begin-
ning his evening chore.)

He can and does use the telephone. Mrs. Thompson
had no idea Spider had mastered the technique of
using the ’phone until one day when she was out and
had left Spider locked in and the carpet caught ﬁre
from an open ﬁreplace. The ’phone rang and central
could hear excited barks. She sent a man and he
broke in and extinguished the ﬁre. Spider had pulled
the receiver oﬁ the hook and barked for help.

Kind Words

If the stray cat or dog is not better off for the kindness
you tried to do him, you are better off just for trying to
help him.

If it doesn’t do the horse any good to have you say a
kind word to him as you pass along, it does you good.

When Bunnies Pray

LOIS SNELLING

I like to watch a bunny pray ——

He does it such a cunning way.

He sits upon his fuzzy tail

Beside the lettuce or the kale;

And then, as solemn as can be,

He folds his paws so quietly.

He never moves a part of him
Except his lips . . . I think with them
He says, “Dear Lord, for all the food
You give to bunnies, when they’re good,
I thank You every single day,”

And then he hops away to play.

Don’t Touch My Baby!

CONRAD O. PETERSON

SOMETHING moved in our alfalfa ﬁeld! A brownish
ﬂash of color! Wondering what it was, I crept closer.
Quiet as I was, it heard me. As it raised its head I saw
that it was a female deer, a doe.

I had seen many deer in our ﬁelds, but most of them
scampered away immediately on seeing a human being.
This one lowered its head and seemed reluctant to leave.
However, with a snort and a toss of its head it soon scam-
pered away, but ran in a long half circle around me!

My suspicion was conﬁrmed. Huddled in the deep grass
I found a baby deer—a pretty creature, not at all afraid
of me. I did not touch it. To do so would give the little
one a touch of human scent which might cause the mother
deer to kill it.

I let the little one lie where it was. It was snug and
cozy, and the mother deer knew its location. Too often
on ﬁnding these baby deer alone, people have moved them,
believing them to be lost! That is cruel to the mother deer.

With the appearance of human beings, or when hunting
for food, the baby deer is carefully hidden by its mother.
She knows where she hid it, but if the little one is moved,
the mother will haunt the spot for days, looking for her
young.

When you see a baby deer in the woods or ﬁeld, let it
alone! The mother is not far away!

As a destroyer of bugs the toad has no equal in the
animal world. The United States Department of Agricul-
ture estimates that toads are worth $20 each per year to

and worms which they destroy He is nearly worth his
weight in gold. Never harm a toad.

Rescues Skunk from Glass Jar

ATE on a Saturday afternoon, in
> December, 1941, Mr. and Mrs. Alton
M. Cook of Chestnut Hill, Mass, were
returning from a Visit with their daugh-
ter at Wheaton College and were driv-
ing on the wooded road just north of
Foxboro, when they saw a large black
and white object in the center of the
road acting queerly, as if dazed.

They stopped their car and Mr. Cook
alighted and found a very large skunk
with his head stuck in a glass honey jar
and apparently nearly suffocated. With-
out thinking of himself or of the usual
unpleasant consequences attendant on an
encounter with a skunk, he called to the
skunk as he would to a dog. The skunk
seemed to understand and came right up
to Mr. Cook, who could see him gasping
for air, inside the glass jar.

The ﬁrst try to twist the jar off was
not successful because the little head was
so ﬁrmly wedged in the jar and the
skunk started away. Mr. Cook again
called him and he came right back to
him. This time Mr. Cook grasped the
skunk by the neck with his right hand
and with his left hand twisted the jar
off. The poor skunk was nearly suffo-
cated by this time and he laid on his
back for several minutes to catch his
breath. -

By this time an audience from eight
or ten cars had collected but most of
them remained at a distance. The skunk
quickly recovered and started for the
ﬁelds. There is no doubt that but for
Mr. Cook’s quick action and his ignoring
any unpleasantness to himself, the skunk
would have died a very agonizing death.

The skunk seemed to understand that
Mr. Cook would help him and he was
very patient. Here is another example
of a man fond of animals knowing what
to do and the understanding of an ani-
mal in distress trusting a human.

Feeding the Wapiti at Jackson Hole

MARY HAYDEN WHITE

Frontispiece and photo shown here by MILTON C. WHITE

OME thirty-ﬁve years ago the peo-
S ple of the Jackson Hole in Wyoming

were ”horriﬁed and dismayed to see
that great bands of elk were coming
down into the valley and literally dying
of starvation before their eyes. It had
been an unusually severe winter. Fall
pasturage on the mountains had been
covered early in the season by deep
snows and there simply wasn’t anything
for the elk to eat.

The few settlers there, although they
were far from rich, rallied to the need.
Out of their own pockets they raised
over a thousand dollars to buy hay to
feed the elk. They then appealed to the
State Legislature, then in session, and
later to the Federal Government with the
result that today twenty—ﬁve thousand
acres of land in the Jackson Hole, right
on the outskirts of the small town of
Jackson, have been turned into a gov-
ernment ranch for the care and main-
tenance of Wyoming’s great elk herd.

Private gifts as well as appropriations
from the Izaak Walton League helped to
do this, while the government appropri-
ated more than six millions of dollars for
purchase of land and upkeep of the ranch.

The wild hay is cut and stored in the
government barns of which there are
ten, each holding more than three hun-
dred tons of hay. When all the fall
pasturage in the ﬁelds has been con-
sumed, the elk are fed by hayrack and
team in much the same manner in which
cattle are fed on neighboring ranches in
the Jackson Hole. An eight-foot fence
has been built around three sides of the
ranch to keep the elk from molesting
hay on other ranches. It has been found
that around thirty—ﬁve hundred tons of
hay must be kept on hand to insure
seeing the elk through unusually severe
winters.

It has not been found necessary to

feed them every winter. Indeed, since
1912 such practice has been necessary
only ﬁve winters of which the past win-
ter of 1940-41 was one. They do not do
well when fed like domestic cattle. Dur-
ing the winter of 1935, for example,
when they had to be fed for nearly four
months, over seven hundred elk died,
nearly all of which were calves. During
the winter of 1939-40 when they were
not fed, only ﬁfty elk died and all of
them mature.

Feeding them, then, is not a perma-
nent solution. It is hoped that eventually
the natural range of the twenty thousand
head of elk in that country can be re-
stored and that the mighty wapiti may
be able to fend for themselves.

Motivated only by sympathy for the
plight of the unfortunate animals, the
people in the Jackson Hole little knew
that in befriending and caring for them,
they were building a great future busi-
ness for themselves. A constantly in-
creasing stream of visitors is found there
every winter to see the elk feeding or
wandering about in great herds on the
feed ground. In no other place in the
world can ten thousand wild animals be
seen like this. Last year it was found
necessary to build new accommodations
on the ranch for the visitors. Two large
new steam—heated hotels to care for the
winter business have been erected re-
cently in the small town. With the
people of the Jackson Hole, it was indeed
“bread cast upon the waters.”

The Rocky Mountain sheep is probably
the most sure—footed animal in the world.
He can climb where men cannot. His
feet are especially constructed for walk-
ing over wet or icy cliffs. The center of
his hoof looks like a rubber pad with
a sharp horny wall outside. He can go
where he likes.

One cannot help wondering what is
happening to the humane societies once
active in France. So far as we can learn,
no information about them has been re-
ceived by humane workers in this country
since Germany overran that fair land.

This war, like all wars, is no respecter
of persons or charitable organizations.
Animal hospitals, like those which care
for sick men, women and children, are
rapidly losing doctors, nurses, attendants,
summoned into military service; but men
and animals are still subject to all the
ills to which they are heir. The problem
grows more and more acute.

You won’t believe it, but there is a
Humane Society in this country where
the most of the work done in the care
of animals is done by paroled murderers
——some white, some black. These attend-
ants are found guilty, not because of
premeditated murder, but because of
some sudden act of temper with no intent
to kill. They prove efﬁcient and trust-
worthy.

That so many horses, mules and even
dogs are being forced into this Satanic
war brings sorrow to all lovers of these
fellow creatures who know nothing of
what it all means. Could they, however,
know, may'it not be they would as gladly
offer their lives to win for themselves
and us, as willingly as millions of our
youth who, for those they love and for
that hope for a better day, are ready to
suffer and, if need be, die.

With all its defects—and they are many

The Bitter with the Sweet

ID you ever have anything to do
with publishing a paper, or maga-
zine, or write any of the editorials for it?
Then you know some of the pleasures and
some of the pains of such a job. Of
:course, you can never please everybody.
If the animals are like people, people are
like animals. Some are friendly, some
are never quite satisﬁed with what they
see or read or eat, and if they don’t like
you or what you say or write, they sel-
dom fail to tell you so.

Here are two ﬁne illustrations of what
we mean. The following letter came to
our desk the other day:

“As to Our Dumb Animals, I have been
surprised at the criticism of older people,
and the lack of interest to children to
whom I have given it to read. The usual
comment is, ‘It probably does some good
but it is so dull.’ ”

The same week came another letter
from an unusually intelligent reader, a
part of which we quoted in the issue of
last month, and which read,

“In Our Dumb Animals—and this may
seem incredible to you—I ﬁnd more real
religion than almost anywhere else, and
I am a church member in good and reg-
ular standing. I turn to it again and
again when my faith in humanity is
slipping, and I ﬁnd help.”

Were it not that letters like the ﬁrst
one referred to are so rare that only
twice in the last year do we recall re-
ceiving one—and that condemned us for
saying a good word for the N egro—and
those like the second so many, we should
hardly think the cost was worth a candle.

The seeds of kindness once rooted in
the hearts of children will grow on
through the years enriching and inspir-
ing their entire lives.

What is the Answer?

What is this war doing to me? Is it
breaking down my faith in the reality
of a moral universe? In a moral universe
where right, though today ground into
the dust, must tomorrow triumph? War
can do that. War is doing that, and if
ever war let loose the blackest demons of
human hate and cruelty, it is this war.

A thousand times through the cen—
turies the men of faith have had the
scornful cry of the faithless ﬂung at
them, “Where is now thy God?” And a
thousand times the men of faith have
answered to their own souls, “Hope thou
in God, for I shall yet praise Him.” And
praised Him they have.

Cruelty to Horses

We have often reported to our readers
about the constant need for careful super-
vision and inspection of riding academies.
Last month our agents found eleven out
of fourteen horses at one riding academy
unﬁt for work. Two of the unfortunate
creatures were unable to get on their feet
without assistance. Thirty gall sores
were found on the eleven animals, some
measuring 41/; inches by 3 inches.

The horses were, of course, taken from
work immediately and the owners ar-
rested for cruelty to animals. In court,
recently, a ﬁne of $25.00 each was im-
posed on the two owners.

The Editor of The Menomouee Falls
News, Mrs. Lottie Rintelman, writes to
Our Dumb Animals:

“I have greatly admired your magazine
for some time, not only for its most in-
teresting articles but for the cause it
stresses. From time to time I have pub-
lished many of those articles in my own
paper, believing it only fair to pass the
ﬁner things along.”

On Dogs

Salvatore Marsiglia

A dog inspired by the love
Returned to him by master men
Will share in man’s eternal strife
And sacrifice his very life.

He does not ask for very much —
Except a kind word now and then;
He does not even ask a bed

To lay his tired heart and head.

He does not ask a sumptuous meal
Perhaps partook by royal dogs;

A bone will satisfy his need,

Nor will he flaunt a vulgar greed.

A hand to scratch behind his ears;

A hand to stroke beneath his jaw;

A romp through wooded glade and hill
With canine joy his heart to fill.

It matters not the breed; oh, no!
All dogs are very much the same;
A mongrel without pedigree —

A dog of blooded ancestry.

Their hearts are both in one accord—
Though one may prouder be.

They’ll share in man's eternal strife,
Or sacrifice their very life.

Care for Soldiers9 Dogs
GENEVRA BUSH GIBSON

WHAT does a soldier do with his dog
when he gets ready to go off to
the army?

He may put it in the Wags or Canine
Corps providing the dog can pass the
tests, he may leave it at home as the
vast majority of the soldiers do, or he
may ship it to some relative down on the
farm.

To provide for the latter exigency the
Railway Express has special crates for
any size dog from a Peke to a Great
Dane. The crates which are made of
wood are sandpapered inside so that
there will be no splinters. In addition
there is a pointed roof so that nothing
can be packed on top of it. Slats in the
front and in the top give light and air
and allow the dog to ﬁnd out what is
going on. A pan for food and a container
for water are also furnished.

When the owner gives the dog over to
the delivery man, he has to furnish a
health certiﬁcate from a veterinarian.
Likewise the shipping agent at the train
has to sign a statement that the dog has
been supplied with food and water and
appeared in good health at the outset of
the journey.

Attached to the crate is a special form
something like the nurse’s chart for a
hospital patient. On this form go nota-
tions of every bit of handling: feeding,
watering, sickness, any odd behavior. If

REAR ADMIRAL FREDERICK C. SHERMAN RECEIVES MEDAL FROM ERIC
H. HANSEN, EXECUTIVE VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE MASSACHUSETTS SO-
CIETY FOR PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS, IN RECOGNITION
OF HIS HUMANE AND HEROIC ACT IN RESCUING HIS DOG, “ADMIRAL
WAGS,” FROM THE BURNING AIRCRAFT CARRIER LEXINGTON IN THE
CORAL SEA. THE PRESENTATION WAS MADE AFTER THE NEW LEXING-
TON WAS LAUNCHED AT FORE RIVER SHIPYARD, SEPTEMBER 26.

 

 

it is a long journey, the dog is given a
chance to stretch his legs on a station
platform at some point of the trip and
the time and place are daily set down on
the chart. Once in a long time a frisky
pup slips his leash while out for the con-
stitutional and there is considerable hub—
bub to catch him. The company says this
rarely happens, and then the dog is prac-
tically always rescued.

Soldiers are always encouraged to tack
a note of instructions on the crate. Many
of them run in the vein of the following
which was attached to the crate of a
German Shepherd: “This is not a vicious
dog. He is a pup and likes to play. He
should be fed once a day but needs plenty
of water. Any exercise that can be given
the dog, and any amusement of such ani-
mal during the trip, will be much appre-
ciated by the dog’s master who is looking
forward to seeing him when the war is
over: His name is ‘Joe.’ ”

Always Welcome
FRED CORNELIUS

We live near a large Army camp, and
I have been pleased to learn how kind
soldiers are to all dogs. I have never seen
a soldier mistreat a dog in any way. No
matter how bedraggled and dirty the dog
may be, he is always welcome. More
than once, I have seen a soldier divide his
meal with some hungry dog that has
found its way into the camp.

And a dog will follow marching sol-
diers all day long, no matter how rough
the going is. And, no matter how short
the ration is, the soldier manages in some
way to ﬁnd a few scraps for the dog he
thinks so much of at the end of a long
march.

Yes, if a dog could speak, I am sure
he would say:

“There is something about a soldier
that is ﬁne!”

Madame Compassionate
Salvatore Marsiglia

She likes to see a dog about,

And so one follows by her side;
Loyal, and loving, tender, too,

She points her spaniel out with pride.

She likes the purring of a cat,

And so she has no less than four;

A new Angora, white with fluff,
And three black rascals from before.

And by the window stands a cage,
And in it sing two yellow birds;

Sweet are the songs my heart records,
Nor can they be described with words.

But this I know: she merits love
Who tenders such unselfish care
Upon a dog and birds and cats
That of affection are aware.

She likes to see a dog about

And cats may wander as they will;
I bless her all-consuming love

For all the lives her life doth fill!

Sousa Loved Animals
EATHEL BUZZARD

OHN PHILIP SOUSA, the great

American bandmaster, was not only
a lover of music but a lover of animals,
too. Once, when touring the country
with his band, he visited Mexico. About
the ﬁrst sport we think of in connection
with Mexico is bull—ﬁghting. Sousa went
to a bull—ﬁght but he did not enjoy it.
When asked for his opinion he said, “It
is a worthless and unfair sport.”

Horseback riding was a favorite sport
of Sousa’s. When his band was playing
in Los Angeles some friends invited him
to Pasadena. He decided to make the
trip on horseback. Everything went well
until his return to Los Angeles. There
he encountered a man who was trying to
force his horse to pull a load far too
heavy for it. The man was beating the
horse unmercifully. Sousa stopped to
protest but his own horse became so
frightened he could do nothing. His
horse ran for a short distance then be-
came calm. Sousa spoke to a Chinaman
standing near and asked him to request
the man to remove part of his load. The
Chinaman replied, “Me not do; not my
horse.” Sousa took the matter up with
some of the inﬂuential people in Los
Angeles and did much to relieve the bur—
dens of such horses in that city.

Sousa’s love of horses is shared by
many persons. One of his little friends
in Virginia could not decide which she
liked better, horses or Sousa’s band. The
next time she heard the band play she
asked to speak to Mr. Sousa. “Mr. Sou-
sa,” she said, “my idea of heaven is

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

horses and you.”

The sport Sousa liked best of all was
clay-bird shooting. This was a Well-
known fact for when he was making a
tour of the world with his band an
angry man wrote to him about shooting
birds. Sousa and his band were in Aus—
tralia. The man reproved Sousa for
shooting “innocent pigeons.” Sousa
promptly bought several clay pigeons
and shot each of them two or three
times; then he sent them to the objector
with a note: “These are the pigeons
I enjoy shooting. I do not believe it has
caused them one single pain.” Sousa
was very much opposed to the shooting
of live pigeons. He said it could in no
way be called a sport.

1. The guanay or cormorant of Peru,
whose waste deposits are exported as
guano to be used as fertilizer.

2. The use of their lovely ﬁlmy feath—

almost extinct until protective legislation
was passed.

3. The scales of these two breeds bear
growth rings similar to the rings of a

4. Three—taste, smell and touch. The
latter is well developed.

5. Snakes are fond of music and can
be controlled by the playing of a ﬂute—like
pipe. However, asps, who have no sense
of hearing, are controlled by rhythmical
motion.

6. 1. Coral snakes.
3. Water moccasins. 4. Copperheads.

7. No. Each time a skin is shed,
usually two or three times a year, a new
ring is formed. Each ring ﬁts over part
of the preceding one and of course
joints increase as long as snakes grow.

The army horses of today are quite
different from those of twenty years ago.
According to the Homer-Glover Messen-
ger, they are fast, lithe, quicker to re-
spond in maneuvers, and have more
stamina. The qualiﬁcations have in-
creased the speed at which mounted
units normally move. No bright or
mixed-colored horses, such as grays,
palominos, or pintos, are accepted, due
to the fact that they are too easily ob-
served from the air. Those available
today are better bred, more gentle and
better broken than those available during
the World War.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

WTe Hear Again from Lebanon

ROM that far-off land in Syria comes
another report from our representa-
tive, Mr. N. B. Matta, president of the
Oriental Humane Education Association,
whose work covers Palestine and Trans-
jordan, as well as Syria.

With very limited means, and yet with
what seems to be marked ﬁdelity, Mr.
Matta is carrying on, almost single-
handed, the work. He says, “What is
worth mentioning is what we are en-
deavoring to get teachers to do—to raise
pets, such as rabbits and pigeons, and
then train the pupils in the proper care
of them.”

He says that this plan has met with
great enthusiasm and approval, and he
is beginning to receive reports about the
interest awakened in the minds of the
pupils. He has translated the pamphlet,
“Kindness to Animals,” into Arabic and
has been able to distribute, gratuitously,
copies to farmers and teachers.

Unable to travel to any extent on ac-
count of the severe cold and rain and
heavy snow, he reports many letters writ-
ten to encourage teachers and others in
the cause. '

Seven horses, seven donkeys, four
mules, three hens and one pigeon have
been taken care of, and fourteen donkeys,
nine cows, nine sheep and four goats
were returned to their owners.

Fondouk Continues to
Function

“The American‘Foudouk continues to
operate in Fez. We are glad to make
this assertion because in so many parts
of the world the war has almost com-
pletely cut off the work that was for-
merly done in behalf of animals.”

President Coleman, of the American
Fondouk Maintenance Committee, is
joined by many interested humanitarians
in the happy realization that the work
in Fez goes on despite everything.

During 1941, Superintendent Guy
Delon celebrated his tenth anniversary
with the American Fondouk, and it is to
be hoped that he will continue to serve
for many years to come.

Donations for the work have fallen off

Juhb 1942

at an alarming rate, from $3,852.11 in
1939 to $1,742.09 in 1941. Contributions
should be sent to M. E. Lyon, Treasurer,
50 Madison Avenue, New York City.

Drastic Dog Ordinance

HE other day the City Commission

in Salt Lake City, Utah, adopted a
highly controverted dog ordinance which
provides a possible death penalty for any
dog that leaves the owner’s property
without being on leash, and imposes ﬁnes
from one dollar to one hundred dollars,
or jail terms from one day to thirty days
for dog owners or keepers who violate
the ordinance.

With many properties not fenced——
with the possibility of many gentle ani-
mals becoming vicious due to chaining,
the dog owners of Salt Lake City are
much concerned about the new, drastic
dog ordinance just enacted.

The ordinance does appear to be pretty
severe and will cause many hardships to
owners as well as to animals. Of late,
many similar laws have been enacted in
diﬁerent parts of the United States, often
brought about by the complete indiffer-
ence of dog owners to the rights of other
people.

The best way to avoid foolish laws is
for dog owners to recognize their respon-
sibility not only to their dog but also to
their fellow citizens. Respect the other
fellow’s right to live in peace. Respect
his property, his children, and everyone
will get along harmoniously. We are all
for the dogs, but the dog that becomes a
nuisance is the greatest enemy of your
dog and every other well-trained dog in
the community.

Help for Russia’s Horses

Russia has millions of horses. Hun-
dreds of thousands are at work in the
interior. Hundreds of thousands more
are on the battle fronts, hauling guns,
munitions and supplies. Regiment after
regiment of superbly mounted cavalry—
men are rendering incalculable service in
attacking the enemy’s ﬂanks and harass-
ing his lines of communication.

To minister to the needs of the vast,
four-footed army is a mighty task. The
Russian veterinary services are large and
admirably equipped, but their resources
are not inexhaustible.

These are some of the reasons why the
Royal Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals in London, under the
leadership of Mrs. Winston Churchill, is
raising funds to help Russia’s animals.
It is a worthy cause.

Should any of our readers desire to
contribute to this fund we shall be glad
to receive such donations and cable them
to the Royal Society in London. Your
donation will be sent as received, our
Society making its contribution by pay-
ing the cable charges.

The First Link

MARY AGNES COLVILLE

ROBABLY no celebrity ever lived

who had a wider contact with a di-
versity of childhood pets than Clara
Barton, the ﬁrst President of the Red
Cross in the United States.

Hers was a unique childhood. Un—
like other little girls, Clara did not care
for dolls. To her a living, breathing
bright—eyed creature with a personality
all its own was much more absorbing
than any inanimate plaything.

So small Clara happily mothered and
showered affection on kittens and rab-
bits, baby chicks and many other pets to

be found on the large estate of her
parents.

Clara’s father was a great lover of
horses and believed in none but the best
of care for them. The Bartons owned
a number of beautiful horses, and even
in baby days, Clara was as much at ease
on the back of one of their beloved colts
as another child would have been on a
wooden rocking horse. This delight in
equine companionship remained un-
changed long after Clara Barton’s child-
hood had passed.

Her ﬁrst individual and sole owner-
ship of a pet however was vested in
“Button,” a medium-sized lively white
dog with sparkling black eyes. Button,
who had very silky ears and a very short
tail, was Clara’s self—appointed guardian
from infancy. He watched her ﬁrst fal—
tering steps and attempted to pick her

up when she fell down.

Throughout her childhood Clara
Barton was never seen without her faith—
ful Button. Where one went—there went
the other. Button even stood guard pa—
tiently at the foot ofthe bed while his
kind, little mistress said her night
prayers.

Cows and cats were also great favor-
ites of the unusual child who daily
welcomed new opportunities to study ani—

mals and to bestow kindnesses upon
them.

Clara was devoted, too, to three
“motherly” hens as she herself described

them—and to some geese and turkeys
as well.

When she was a few years older, her
group of special pets which attracted the
most attention was her ﬂock of hand-
some domestic ducks. These ducks ﬂoat-
ing on the little pond on the Barton
estate were seen by wild ducks passing
over from the northern lakes to the
southern bays. Stopping to rest on their
long journey, the wild ducks taught the
tame ducks many gymnastic feats. This
extraordinary sight brought groups of
onlookers from neighboring points to
witness it. It is doubtful if any little
girl ever attracted so much notice for
her interest in dumb creatures.

Clara delighted in the responsibility
of seeing that all the ducks—her own
and the visiting ones were generously
fed. But her concern over them did not
make her forget any of the other animals
or birds on the estate.

That early devotion of Clara Barton’s
to the welfare of helpless animals and
birds was the ﬁrst bright link forged in
that shining chain of later more wide-
spread service. A service which re-

sponded to the needs of suffering
humanity.

They Read “Our Dumb
Animals”

HE junior editor of the Daily News,

Springﬁeld, Mass, is a “constant
reader” of Our Dumb Animals, as shown
by her reference to our June number in a
recent issue of the News. Under the head-
ing “Junior News Broadcasts,” in double
column, a concise summary of four
articles appeared, all cleverly written to
stress kindness to animals. In the intro-
duction the junior editor says, referring
to Our Dumb Am’mals, “Frequently when
I pick it up, I am reminded of the old
police chief whom I used to ﬁnd reading
it every month. He was a kind man, so
the stories of kindness to animals must
have pleased him.” Some months this
entire junior page of the News has been
given over to the work of the S. P. C. A.,
which maintains a branch of its Angell
Animal Hospital in Springﬁeld.

Birds and Airplanes
L E S T E R B A N K S

THE attitude of birds toward air-
planes has been the subject of con-
siderable study, and while much yet re-
mains to be determined, observers agree
on one fact: not all kinds of birds react
in the same manner.

Without doubt, the most general atti-
tude is indifference; some birds, kites
anyway, frequently sleep in ﬂight, drift-
ing along with outspread wings; and
unless the aviator sees them in time
there’ll be a fatal collision.

It requires rather close proximity and
obvious danger to alarm gulls. The regu-
lar ﬂight of bombers from England to
France did not disturb the gulls; they
paid little attention even to the high-up
ﬁghting; but when the more serious bat-
les began, in which anti-aircraft batter-
ies came into play, the gulls left, highly
indignant, for more peaceful parts.

Ducks, partridges and pheasants ap-
pear to be wholly indifferent, while pe-
wits or green plover are so curious that
they sometimes ﬂy alongside and peer
into the machine. One wild duck did
cause a crash-up into the water off Van—
couver; in panic of fear, it ﬂew into the
pilot’s face with stunning force.

Migrating birds have been charged
with attacking airplanes, when the fact
was that their number, and disinclina-
tion to break the ﬂying-formation, was
the real cause. Over the Alps during
the migratory period, there are forma-
tions made almost “solid” by literally
thousands of birds; and one pilot re-
ported that they ﬂew straight through
a cloud without breaking formation. He
had to swerve to avoid them; there was
no question in that group-mind about
right-of—way !

But there is no denying that some
birds, notably eagles, will deliberately at-
tack an airplane. Several years ago a
pair of eagles “dive—bombed” a sixteen-
passenger plane in India, causing a
wreck that killed the pilot and injured
a number of the crew. One of the big
birds ﬂew straight into the middle en-
gine, while its mate swooped from 10,-
000 feet and went through a steel wing.
Survivors of the catastrophe were posi-
tive that the eagles attacked deliberately.

It was such experiences that led the
Royal Air Ministry to issue a notice
warning all aviators in the Near- and
Middle-East to ﬂy above eagles and
kites, since these birds almost always
dive when frightened or angered.

Birds do have their favorite stratum
in the air, and they dislike to get out of
1t. An instance is given of a carrier pi-
geon released from a balloon. At 10,000
feet it ﬂew away promptly; also at 3,000
feet. But at 8,000 feet it was confused,
and settled on the gas bag until the
balloon came nearer to earth.

Wild Life Photography

HENRY H.

NE autumn day while walking
Q around the shore of a reedy lake

in quest of wild life photographic
subjects I unexpectedly came upon a man
who had the reputation of being a great
hunter. But, although the duck hunting
season was in full swing this chap had
no gun. Instead, a camera encased in a
neat ever-ready case hung over his
shoulder.

“What!” I gasped. “You don’t mean
to tell me you’ve traded your gun for a
camera?”

He smiled. “Exactly. You couldn’t
have guessed any more accurately, for
that is precisely what I’ve done.”

“How come?” I asked. “Is the old
thrill of killing gone?”

“Absolutely,” he stated. “And I hope
never to return. As you know, I hunted
ducks, geese, pheasants, deer and many
other creatures for years. But last fall
I was cured. I shot into a ﬂock of mal—
lards and ﬁve came down. Out of that
number only one fell dead. The other
four, winged, swam out into mid-lake
beyond the reach of my gun. Think of
it—four out of ﬁve handsome mallards
crippled! Some of them would probably
die to furnish carrion for coyotes roam-
ing the shore. Others might suffer from
hunger and certainly from pain before
their wings "healed. Perhaps they would
be unable to join the hordes of ducks
migrating southward later. It was heart-

rending.

“The more I thought about it the
more brutal and unjust it seemed. I
shelved my gun, brought out my camera,
dusted it and began to cast about for
ﬁtting photographic subjects. I found
them in abundance. And I found some—
thing more, too—that wild life photo—
graphy is inﬁnitely more thrilling than
hunting with a gun. It’s a wonderful
substitute.”

He pointed proudly to his ﬁne minia-
ture camera, a most trim and useful in-
strument.

“With this machine I can stop swiftly-
moving ducks in full ﬂight,” he said,
“much better than I ever could with a
gun. And without spilling a bit of blood,
either. I used to be a glutton for getting
my limit with a shotgun; I’m still a
glutton, but for beautiful pictures of
ducks instead. I do my own enlarging
and get a big kick out of it.”

“I’m glad to hear it, Jim,” I said. “I,
too, ﬁnd wild life photography a wonder—
ful hobby and much more interesting
than shooting with a gun.”

Bathing Ducks

A seventeen-year-old high school stu-
dent of Long Beach, California, Stanton
Phillips, has the unique hobby of scrub-
bing ducks—ducks that he ﬁnds en-
tangled in crude oil. His story is told
by Ray G. Funkhouser in
Buick Magazine.

Stanton discovered that
hundreds of waterfowl be-
come entrapped in slush pits,
and in ponds, sloughs, and
small streams ﬁlmed with
escaped crude oil. The oil not
only mats their feathers so
they cannot ﬂy but contains
an acid that slowly scalds
them.

After much experiment-
ing, Stanton found that two
applications of warm corn
oil, followed by a Vigorous
soap and water scrubbing
and a tannic acid powder
dusting was the best method
to save these birds. But the
treatment also removes the
natural oil from their plu—
mage, without which they
cannot swim. This meant
taking care of them for a
minimum of six weeks and
often longer. Before he re-
leases the birds to return to
their native life they must
undergo a swimming test. He
has also become an expert in
the repair of wounded birds.

Man’s Friend, the Goat

T. J. MCINERNEY

ANIMALS are frequently the un-

deserving victims of man’s unwar-
ranted prejudice. There are many people
who are prejudiced against cats, even
though they have never owned one. Their
prejudice arises from some unfounded
report or rumor. The same is true of
other animals including goats.

For many years I have been acquainted
with a herd of goats that graze in the
open lots near my home and I have come
to appreciate the splendid service which
these animals perform for man—a serv-
ice, incidentally, that is well-known and
appreciated by those in the medical pro-
fession.

According to the ﬁrst national goat
census taken in 1940, there were 3,417,-
347 goats in the United States—truly a
sizable population in the animal kingdom.
The majority of these are on goat dairy
farms, from whence their milk goes to
hospitals, sanitariums and to doctors to
aid in the recovery of invalids and the
development of strong children.

Goat milk, contrary to a popular notion,
is not a medicine, but a wholesome food
like cow milk. It has the added merit of
being more easily digested because of its
smaller, ﬁner and more easily assimilated
fat globules. It is the only milk that can
be taken in its natural state, because
tuberculosis rarely or never exists among
goats. Goat milk, therefore, needs no
pasteurization and runs no danger of los-
ing its vitamins or having its other food
values altered by the application of heat.

In addition to being used for babies
and invalids, the milk of the goat makes
delicious ice cream, butter and cheese,
whipped cream and, as a beverage, is very
tasty.

The most popular breeds of goats are
Nubians, French alpines, rock alpines,
Saanens and Toggenburgs.

Nubians are of English and Oriental
origin, characterized by short, sleek
coats, rich colors, drooping ears and
Roman nose. French alpines vary in color
and combinations of color and are pro-
ducers of good quality milk in large
quantities. Rock alpines are the only

breed originating in the United States
and are of the same general description
as French alpines.

Saanens are a Swiss

The Coming Brotherhood

There shall come from out this noise of
strife and groaning,
A broader and a iuster brotherhood;
A deep equality of aim, postponing
AII selfish seeking to the general good.
There shall come a time, when each shall
to another
Be as Christ would have him, brother unto
brother.

There shall come a time when brotherhood
. grows stronger
Than the narrow bounds which now
distract the world,
When the cannons roar and trumpets blare
no longer,
And the ironclads rust, and battle-flags
are furled;
When the bars of creed and speech and
race, which sever,
Shall be fused in one humanity forever.

breed and are white and usually quite
large. It is said that they are unsurpassed
as milk producers. The Toggenburgs are
also a Swiss breed and are the most
numerous in this country, large numbers
having been imported prior to the cur-
rent war. Other breeds of goats common
in this country are the Angora, Maltese
and Cashmere.

I wish that more people would become
better acquainted with the milch goat
which contributes so much toward the
better health of humankind. May her
tribe increase!

The American Eagle

SOARIN G high in the sky or swooping

earthward like a winged thunderbolt,
the American bald eagle well deserves the
exalted honor accorded him in 1782 when
he became the national emblem of the
United States of America. Its extraordi-
nary power of sight, the wild majesty of
its appearance, and the picturesque gran-
deur of the scenery in which it loves to
build its aerie, have made the eagle the
universal emblem of might and courage
from the most ancient times.

Eagles of virtually all species, contrary
to the belief of many individuals, are not
cruel, wanton aerial killers. Being birds
of prey they naturally—as does every liv-
ing creature—try to appease the demands
of their appetite, which actually is far
from voracious.

In the words of John Burroughs, the
great American naturalist, the eagle
“draws great lines across the sky; he
sees the forests like a carpet beneath
him; he sees the hills and valleys as folds
and wrinkles in a many-colored tapestry;
he sees the river as a belt connecting re-
mote horizons. We climbed mountain
peaks to get a glimpse of the spectacle
that is hourly spread out beneath him.”

The Hunter and the War

NE of these days we hope the non-
hunting friends of wild life will
demand their share of our migratory
birds in order to enjoy the pleasure of
their life with us in the air, as well as
on land and sea.

Like many others interested in the
protection and preservation of the birds,
we had hoped, unfortunately in vain,
that now that the nation is at war, the
hunting season would be cut short and a
closed season on many species imposed.
Instead of that, it would seem that the
open season in some cases has been ex-
tended in order to permit the so—called
sportsmen an opportunity to hunt to
their hearts’ content.

Yes—the destruction must go on re-
gardless. Gasoline and tires to get to
duck blinds, new hunting clothes, guns,
ammunition, etc., hardly seem to ﬁt into
the picture of a nation tightening its
belt for the struggle ahead. Make the
comparison between one of our soldiers
in a kill or be—killed ﬁght with the enemy
in the jungles of the Solomons, and the
hunter, well-clothed and fed, sitting in
a blind, waiting for a duck to come over.
Well —why go on. It’s too disheartening
to even think about.

This May Answer Your
Questions

HE following letter to one of our good

members who asked certain questions
with regard to the feeding of dogs, may
interest you: t
“I have just submitte’your letter and
the article that you enclosed to a member
of our staff who is really an expert in
this matter of feeding dogs.

“He tells me that the article is a valu—
able one and that its statements are to
be accepted. Of course in this matter of
feeding, starches like potatoes and also
fats are all right, but they would natu-
rally be in moderation with other foods.
Where there are scraps enough left from
the family table to take care of the dog,
there is really nothing better than that,
if they have the proper amount of these
various foods. In these times when meat
is so scarce, the element that is lacking
from the left-over table scraps would be
meat or protein. Horse meat is also
available, Dr. Munson says, at a time
like this.

“I am also enclosing a leaﬂet which will
give you our latest directions with regard
to this whole subject. Any diet that con—
tains a reasonably high percentage of
table scraps will have an adequate
amount of Vitamins.

“As to Vitamins, the Doctor tells me
that no one is really sufﬁcient —— that
most deﬁciencies are multiple deﬁciencies
rather than a deﬁciency of a single Vita-
min—and that if one ﬁnds it necessary to
use Vitamins, they should be the complete
vitamins—A, B, C, D and G. Many of
the pharmaceutical houses produce cap-
sules containing all of these vitamins.

“Only individual animals cannot digest
the white of uncooked eggs; the majority
can, if not fed in excess. The mature dog
does not need fresh milk if the diet con-
tains the necessary minerals.

Sincerely yours”

A Better World for Man

and Animals

The above phrase is the ﬁne slogan of
the Australian branch of the World
League for Protection of Animals in
Sydney. Their interesting quarterly bul—
letin, “The Animals’ Champion,” has just
reached our desk, and we are of course
much pleased to ﬁnd that the editors fea-

tured Dr. Rowley’s leaﬂet entitled “The
Animal or The Child.”

When the manufacturers of guns, to
be used particularly for killing wild life,
congratulate themselves on being able to
make the most accurate and deadly guns
“for,” as they say, “the lovers of wild
life” to'ki’ll, one wonders just who the
“lovers of wild life” are.

Nov. 1942

The Russian Cossack

ITH the approach of winter, the

value of the horse in modern war-
fare will prove itself. Russia recognizes
this. No other combatant power has de-
veloped her equine resources in- compar-
able measure. Russia’s cavalry is highly
developed, and during the bitter winter
months just ahead, it will see plenty of
action.

Paul Holt, of the London Daily Ex—
press, recently paid a visit to Colonel
Michael Sarjikov, commander of a Cos-
sacks division. Here are some of the
highlights of the interview:

“The Cossacks are the glamour corps
of the Red Army.

“There are three kinds of Cossacks —
Kuban, Orenberg and Don. They can be
recognized by the color of their bashliks
or hoods. The Kubanski hood is red, the
Orenberg, blue, and the Don, gray.

“They are mostly farmers and ride on
shaggy, Siberian ponies. These tough
little animals can carry more weight than
an Irish hunter, and they often travel
twenty to ﬁfty miles a day under winter
conditions, carrying a rider equipped
with sabre, tommy gun, revolver—some
with anti-tank equipment too.

“The horses are trained to lie down
and get up again swiftly, without the
rider dismounting, and no Cossack horse
is bothered by gunﬁre.”

In London, the Royal S. P. C. A. War
Animals Fund, under the leadership of
Mrs. Winston Churchill, has already
forwarded many thousands of dollars to
the Russian Veterinary Corps. The drive
is a worthy one, deserving support.

Fined for Putting Cat
in Mailbox

Fred F. Hall, our prosecuting ofﬁcer
in Springﬁeld, recently caused the arrest
of a 22-year—old war plant worker. The
defendant admitted to Hall and postal
inspectors that he had put a live cat in
a mailbox one night while waiting for a
bus to take him to his place of employ-
ment.

Aside from the seriousness of the
cruelty involved, postal oﬂicials said that
anyone who thinks lightly of pranks in
which mailboxes are connected will, in
all cases Where apprehension is possible,
certainly change his ideas.

In court recently, the offender was
convicted of cruelty to animals and ﬁned
ten dollars. The United States District
Attorney is looking into the matter of
Federal charges.

The American Humane Education Society

had heeded the principles advocated

by George T. Angell during the
twenty years from his organization of
the American Humane Education So-
ciety to his death, we would not now be
involved in the awful holocaust which
confronts us.

He said: “The American Humane
Education Society is striving to unite
all religious and political parties on
one platform, for the purpose of carry-
ing a humane literature and education
into all the schools of the country, and
thus not only insure the protection of
animals, but also the prevention of
crime, unnecessary wars, and forms of
violence. When the leading minds of
all nations shall act together on this
subject and the nations shal’l be hu-
manely educated, wars between nations
will end.”

1F this and other civilized countries

But, alas, although this Society, dur-
ing the generation following, has con-
tinued to hold up these ideals, again
we have failed to heed the admonition,
and wars between nations have not
ended. Shall we ever come to realize
the great importance of humane educa—
tion to our physical “as well as to our
mental and spiritual welfare? Please
have "this question in mind as you read
what our one organization has at-
tempted to accomplish during 1941,
through its ﬁeld workers distributed in
a dozen widely separated states as well
as through its activities at the Boston
headquarters.

New Staff Member in Boston

Mr. John F. Cotter of Boston, former
secretary to the Honorable John P.
Higgins during Mr. Higgins’ service as
Congressman from Massachusetts, came
to the Society late in June and, in addi-
tion to handling an unusual amount of
press publicity for our two organizations,
has done much work along the lines of
humane education. He began a series
of talks and exhibitions of humane ﬁlms
before units of the Junior Police Corps
in Boston, and gave addresses in a num-
ber of parochial schools.

Mr. Cotter’s years in Washington and
his familiarity with public affairs here in
Massachusetts make him a valuable addi-
tion to our force. He really served in
Congress as Mr. Higgins’ representative
until the latter’s successor was chosen.

Mrs. Clarke, who died early in April,

had passed in reports for January and
February. She attended 13 club meet-
ings, gave ﬁve talks, reached 2,500 people,
sent out 225 letters, and distributed 3,200
pieces of literature, including press slips.

The Humane Education Press Bureau
was taken over in June by Miss Katharine
H. Piper of the home oﬂice who continues
to send out slips to more than 400 news—
papers and individuals each month. In
addition, several hundred slips are cir-
culated through Dr. Wentzel of Pitts-
burgh, Pia.

Miss Maryott, who had been a faith-
ful representative of the Society in the
schools of Massachusetts for twenty-ﬁve
years, retired at the close of the school
year. In the ﬁrst six months she gave 50
talks before 10,000 pupils and 300 adults
in schools of Brockton, Fitchburg, An—
dover, Bridgewater, Stoughton, Revere
and Boston, where she organized 277 new
Bands of Mercy.

In New York and Pennsylvania

In March and April Miss Gilbert vis-
ited schools in Watertown, New York,
and vicinity. During May and the ﬁrst
week in June she visited cities and towns
in New York State, and in the fall re-
turned to Maine, where she had been in
previous years, to continue work in the
schools there. She placed posters in store
windows, distributed literature, and
through interviews and articles sent to
the newspapers promoted humane edu-
cation wherever she found opportunity.
Altogether she reached 18,865 children
and 750 (adults in visits to 135 schools
where she gave 391 talks and organized
566 Bands of Mercy.

Dr. Wentzel, secretary of the Western
Pennsylvania Humane Society, Pitts—
burgh, carries on a vast amount of hu-
mane education work as a representative
of the American Humane Education So-
ciety. He visited about 30 towns, mostly
in Pennsylvania, and gave 91 talks in 73
schools. He reported 374 Bands of
Mercy and that more than 50,000 chil-
dren were reached. His 61 other ad-
dresses were given before Rotary
Clubs, Lions’ Clubs, P. T. A. conventions,
Commencements, and Vacation Bible
schools. He had 56 showings of the
“Bell of Atri” and other ﬁlms, and dis—
tributed great quantities of humane lit-
erature, including press slips provided
monthly by the Press Bureau at head-
quarters.

In Virginia and Tennessee

Miss Finley, formerly a regular ﬁeld
worker, is still interested in presenting
humane education in the schools of Vir-
ginia and from time to time sends in
reports of her activities. She visited 120
schools and contacted others through the
supervisors and by mail. She placed 219
posters and a quantity of literature,
gave 11 short talks, and held three ex-
hibits of bird and animal pictures. She
represented the Society at a State Teach-
ers’ Convention, and at meetings of
supervisors and principals.

Mr. Lemon traveled more than a thou-
sand miles a month in carrying the hu-
mane message to the colored people in
283 different towns of Virginia. He
gave 203 school talks and 58 addresses
before adult audiences, reaching a total
of nearly 25,000 persons, and distribute-d
about 2,800 pieces of humane literature.
He held an exhibit in connection with the
summer school and ministers’ conference
at Hampton Institute in June. Through-
out the year he gave practical aid in
several instances both to animals and
aged persons.

Nearly 15,000 miles of travel through
Tennessee was reported by Mrs. Burton
who visited 108 schools and many state
conferences, conventions, clubs, P. T. A.
meetings, and religious and educational
groups. She gave 92 school talks before
nearly 10,000 children, and 49 addresses
before 7,300 adults. She secured 4,250
Jack London Club pledges, and circulated
nearly 3,000 pieces of literature. She
reports splendid cooperation from the
various groups in her ﬁeld.

In South Carolina, Georgia and Florida

Through the efforts of Mr. Carroll the
Governor and mayors of several cities
of South Carolina issued proclamations
for Be Kind to Animals Week. It was
endorsed by the State Superintendent
and very generally observed in schools
and colleges. Mr. Carroll mailed a news
story about the Week to 150 newspapers
in 14 states.

He visited 261 towns in North Caro-
lina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Vir-
ginia; held an exhibit at the South Caro-
lina State Teachers’ Convention; spoke
before the general assembly of rural
teachers; conducted the annual Bro-ok-
green Welfare and Humane Conference;
arranged a program of work in summer
schools for teachers in three states;

Be Kind to Animals Week Comes to Bay State

School Posters and Exercises, Radio, Press, Lectures Pro-claim Unusual Activities of

to Animals Week was marked in

Massachusetts by one of the most
successful animal poster contests ever
conducted by the S.P.C.A. The most sig-
niﬁcant showing of these posters yet
held extended during the entire week of
April 20 to 25, when about 700 of them
were displayed in the large auditorium
on the ﬁfth ﬂoor of the Annex of the
Jordan Mars‘h Company in Boston. Hun-
dreds of interested teachers, pupils and
others viewed this artistic display and
were enthusiastic in their praise of it.

Opposite is shown a View of the of-
ﬁcial visit to the exhibit of Commissioner
of Education Walter F. Downey, accom-
panied by President Francis H. Rowley
and Executive Vice-President Eric H.
Hansen of the Massachusetts S.P.C.A.
In addition to granting this liberal space
to the Society, the Jordan Marsh Com-
pany generously gave up an entire win-
dow to a further display of the posters
with signs calling attention to the main
exhibit. Wm. Filene’s Sons Company
also co-operated by a most artistic win-
dow showing of plaster replicas of a life-
size Russian wolfhound accompanied by
a little girl, also a miniature statue of
St. Francis of Assisi with birds upon
his shoulders and animals by his side,
all surrounded with appropriate posters
and Be Kind to Animals mottoes. An-
other attractive display was a window
on the Winter Street side of the Gil-
christ Company, while other stores car-
ried less pretentious exhibits.

Judging by the number of posters
received, 7,381, and the fact that teach-
ers may select not more than ﬁve from
any one room, it is conservatively esti-
mated that not less than 50,000 pupils
entered this contest. It would appear,
more than in any previous year, that all
the ﬁne, creative talent in our children
came to the fore. The posters, repre-
senting school art at its best, came from
511 different schools, representing 170
cities and towns of the state. More than
3,200 prizes were awarded, as follows:
First, bronze medal with blue ribbon,
717; second, bronze medal with red rib-
bon, 930; honorable mention, one year’s
subscription to Our Dnmb ‘ Animals,
1,563.

THE twenty-eighth annual Be Kind

Unusual Radio Programs

For the unusual co-operation of the
Bostonbroadcasting stations, over which
twelve different programs were pre—
sented by the Massachusetts S.P.C.A.
during the Week, we are indeed grate-
ful. These opened on Humane Sunday,
on Station WBZ, with an interview with

Massachusetts S. P. C. A.

President Rowley and Thornton W.
Burgess; and a talk over Station WORL
by John F. Cotter. Daily programs were
presented over Station WMEX, with
talks by Dr. Erwin F. Schroeder, Albert
A. Pollard, L. Willard Walker, Eric H.
Hansen and Dr. R. H. Schneider. On
Tuesday Mr. Cotter presented a children’s
program on Station WHDH. Outstand-
ing was the talk by President Francis
H. Rowley, on Thursday, over the Mu-
tual Network, coast to coast hook-up, on
Station WAAB. On Friday a talk was
given on Station WEEI by Guy Rich-
arzdson. On Saturday there was an in-
terview between Dr. G. B. Schnelle and
Miss Margaret J. Kearns on Station
WHDH. Other talks were given by ofﬁ-
cers of the Society on stations outside
of Boston.

Other Addresses and Activities

For the sixth consecutive year, on the
afternoon of Humane Sunday, the popu-
lar story teller, Thornton W. Burgess,
gave one of his intensely interesting i1-
lustrated lectures at the Boston Public
Library. The large lecture hall was
completely ﬁlled with admirers of this
magnetic speaker whose new colored
ﬁlms of birds and animals were received
with marked enthusiasm. A feature of
the gathering was the introduction of
President Rowley of the Society, who re-
sponded in a few inspiring words.

During the Week, Mr. Hansen ad-
dressed the Winchester Auxiliary at a
public meeting held at the Library, and
also spoke to a large noonday audience
at the Civilian Defense Exhibit in down-
town Boston.

There was “open house” at the Angell
Memorial Animal Hospital and every day
numerous visitors, many of them chil-
dren, were shown through the building.
Four groups of the Boston Junior Police
Corp-s were received. After a trip
through the Hospital, in which the boys
expressed themselves as greatly pleased,
they were taken to the auditorium and
shown moving pictures, under the direc-
tion of Mr. Cotter. The illustration on
page 108 shows a group of these boys in
the courtyard of the Hospital.

Mayors Proclaim the Week

In addition to the ofﬁcial designation
of Humane Sunday and Be Kind to Ani-
mals Week by Governor Saltonstall of
Massachusetts, the mayors of Somerville,
Chelsea and Holyoke, and the chairman
of the selectmen of Brookline, issued of-
ﬁcial proclamations or statements calling
for the observance of the Week.

Humane Day in Schools

Nearly 11,000 copies of the Society’s
original compilation of “Humane Exer—
cises for the Use of Teachers,” an eight-
page pamphlet, were required for the
observance of Humane Day in the
schools of Massachusetts alone. Pro-
grams were given in all sections, many
of them being held on Friday, April 17,
because of vacations during the follow-
ing week. This date was ofﬁcially desig-
nated for the schools of Boston by Su-
perintendent Arthur L. Gould. A sample
program was that given by the ﬁfth
grade pupils in the Lincoln school, Win-
chester, which consisted of appropriate
recitations, essays, songs, stories, and
a short play, “Let Us Have Pets.” Plays
were given by the pupils of the foreign
language department of the Highland
Junior High school in Holyoke, together
with recitations and the reading of Gov-
ernor Saltonstall’s Proclamation. The
Daily Transcript and Telegram of H01-
yoke carried a large picture showing
Naturalist Schurr explaining about va-
rious animals to children from different
schools in the Museum at the Public
Library.

Among the various groups who Visited
the poster exhibit in Boston was one of
twenty-ﬁve pupils from the Junior High
school of As‘hland. Other groups, in-
cluding Scouts, took advantage of the
“open house” invitation to tour the
Angel] Animal Hospital during the week.

Hearty Press Co-operation

The press of the state, and especially
that of Boston, gave excellent support
to our activities in connection with the
Week. Many articles and feature pic-
tures were used daily. Excellent edi-
torials appeared in the Christian Science
Monitor, Boston, the Boston Traveler,
the Worcester Gazette, the Hampshire
Gazette, Northampton, the Evening
Union, Springﬁeld, the Fitchbnrg Sen-
tinel, the N ewbnryport News, the Web-
ster Times and the Orleans Record.

Fine Publicity in Rhode Island

Thanks to the Providence Journal, Be
Kind to Animals Week was prominently
heralded in Rhode Island where the local
Humane Education Society had charge
of an extensive program of activities.
Governor McGrath endorsed the Week,
as did State Director of Education
Rockett, Mayor Roberts of Providence,
and U. S. Senator Peter G. Gerry. Radio
talks were given over the local stations.
Instructions for the care of dogs and
cats in air raids were widely distributed.

Cats

Salvatore Marsiglia

Cats are impish elves that sit

Wise and Buddha-like, and dream—
Dreaming of the ancient days

I decipher from their gaze.

Placid are they, yet not deaf
To the stirring of a leaf;
Passing zephyrs may afright
Or the mystic sounds of night.

There is beauty in a cat—

Sleek and furry . . . sensuous;

Eyes that shine, now green, now red,
In an aristocratic head.

And a kitten with a ball
Is an object of delight;
Little paws that swiftly hie
Aft a green leaf flitting by;

Paws that patter in your wake;
Eyes that follow every move . . .
Dogs no more loyal are than they,
Nor more charming in their play.

Cats are impish elves that sit
Purring with a deep content;
They are dreaming of the days
So reflected in their gaze.

A Little Kindness

JESSIE MERLE FRANKLIN

HAVE learned that very often the

animal considered vicious or danger-
ous is merely frightened, and that a little
kindness on the part of humans is the
needed cure. I wish that everyone might
remember this observation.

A good illustration of it came to my
attention recently. Arriving at the ofﬁce
one morning I found the janitor trying
to remove a hapless cat that had somehow
strayed into the building. This he was
doing by reaching through an adjoining
window with a broom and yelling and
hitting at the fear—crazed animal which
had escaped to the ledge outside an open
window. The cat was meowing piteously
as it contemplated the choice of a two—
story leap to the pavement below, or
escape through the hall past the seem-
ingly unfriendly people watching it.

Telling the janitor to stop, I approached
the cat slowly, speaking in a low, calm
voice. The janitor warned, “I wouldn’t
get too close to him, Miss. He’s mean!
He’ll sure jump on you!”

The cat did look wild, but as I talked
to it I could see the fear subsiding in its
eyes. Reaching out, and still speaking
gently, I touched its head. Then I began
to stroke, and the stiffened body relaxed;
in a moment the “mean” cat began to
rub against my hand and purr! A few
minutes later it was easily carried from
the building to safety.

AT THE PORTAL OF KINDNESS

 

Cats in French Literature
CHARLOTTE C. WEST, M. D.

F all creatures, including the genus
homo, the cat is the most con-
sistently independent, self—reliant,

self—sufﬁcient, virile, mystical and myste—
rious. He does not consort with animals
alien to his tribe, occasionally he be-
comes atavistic, but only for short pe-
riods. Science says the anatomy of the
cat has not changed in any particular
since man has had any knowledge of it,
which dates back thousands of years be-
fore the Christian era.

So, from remotest antiquity, and lat—
terly, when naturalists and scientists
have added to our knowledge by studies
on the behaviorism of this most fasci-
nating of all animals, the cat, after thou—
sands of years and despite the scientiﬁc
data garnered, remains an enigma. Why?
One ailurophile declares, “Any mystic
philosopher can feel more than a scien-
tist can ever learn.”

To those who View cats with indif-
ference, neither liking nor disliking
them, the attitude of the cat lover is
somewhat perplexing. The French liter-
ati are especially conspicuous in this re-
gard. Their love for the feline amounts
to worship. Endlessly in prose, poesy

and fantasy, they pay homage to the
grace, beauty, intelligence, mysticism
and companionship of the cat.

There is a something, a peculiarly
strange afﬁnity between the dreamy,
imaginative, mystical mentality of the
French litterateur and the remote enig—
matical nature of the feline.

The hyperbolic effusions of Pierre
Loti have been quoted and translated by
dozens of writers. Apropos of one of
his feline favorites: “Whilst servants
and visitors have been on the spot, he
has scornfully kept out of the way, un—
der an armchair, for no other person
than myself is allowed to stroke his in-
valuable immaculate coat. But no sooner
does he perceive that I am alone, than
he comes and sits in front of me, sud-
denly assuming one of those expressive
looks that are seen from time to time
in such enigmatical, contemplative ani-
mals as belong to the same genus as
himself. His yellow eyes look up at me,
wide open, the pupils dilated by a mental
effort to interrogate and attempt to un-
derstand: ‘Who are you after all?’ he
asks. ‘Why do I trust you?’ ‘Of what im—
portance are you in the world?’ In our

The New Year

We wish we could say to all who
read these words, “A Happy New
Year,” but if to us there is neither
Greek nor Jew, Barbarian, Cytherean,
bondman nor free—and all of them our
kin—then, knowing what War, this New
Year, must mean to unnumbered mil-
lions of them, we must sorrow with
their sorrow and lift our hearts with
deepest gratitude for all the blessings
that are ours. Though war now has
come to us we are still a people strong
and free and at last united.

We are just as fond of animals as we
are willing to make sacriﬁces of time
and money in their behalf.

What can we as a Nation do when
a ruthless foe, violating its sacred plea
for peace, sweeps down upon us with
brutal disregard of every human right,
but defend our liberties and our homes?

It is a great debt the humane cause
and all benevolent and charitable organi-
zations owe the public press. The pub—
licity given to the work of these societies
by the newspapers not only stimulates
interest in their activities, but brings
ﬁnancial help.

An important meeting was held
recently in the ofﬁces of the Massachu-
setts S. P. C. A. by humane workers of
the State, and a committee was ap-
pointed to work in co-operation with the
Massachusetts Committee on Public
Safety for the purpose of disseminating
knowledge to all owners of animals as
to the best methods to be used in case
of an air raid. Further particulars will
be given in our next issue.

The Great Gulf

LL of us who love animals should

stop frequently and take anew our
bearings. Wonderful as appear at times
the intelligence and almost human clev-
erness of the animal, a little thought
reveals the great gulf that divides his
life from ours. The baby just born is, so
far as we can discover, no different in
mental or moral constitution from the

young puppy or the helpless kitten, in—

deed rather less promising in these re-
spects than the new-born colt. But there
comes a day when the human child be-
gins to say “I” and “you”; when that
transcendent gift of speech is evident
as a part of his great inheritance. By
this alone is he separated immeasurably
from the creatures below him.

“The animal,” said Professor James,
“has a hair-trigger constitution, and
action follows immediately upon im-
pulse.” Show a hungry dog a bone and
he enters into no debate with himself as
to whether he should eat it or not. It is
true he will bury a bone and so save it
for some future meal, but not if he is
hungry. No horse, so far as we know,
ever left half his oats today fearing
that he might need them more tomorrow.
Impulses are not restrained among ani-
mals to conserve health and add to efﬁ-
ciency. Marvelous as may be the power
of my dog to understand my moods,
deathless as his affection and ﬁdelity, his
mental state is as unsolved a mystery to
me as it was to my remotest ancestor.

This does not mean that the claim
upon us of the animal is one whit the
less for justice, kindness, protection
from needless pain. Rather the more,
because this gulf exists, because I am
the more highly endowed, must I show
to him the spirit of good will and
thoughtful care. Noblesse oblige.

He is Not Deaf

EW animals surpass the horse in “the

keenness of his hearing: yet there are
a multitude of drivers who yell and shout
as if the horse in front of them with the
delicate and sensitive ear were sixteen
blocks away. We have sometimes been
able to convey a sound to the horse
we were driving which the person sitting
beside us could not hear. The quiet, con-
ﬁdent tOnes of the voice aid greatly in
controlling the horse. We do not like
drivers who never talk to their horses,
though there used to be a driver of a
six-horse team in Boston known as
“Silent Jim.” People stopped often to
watch him handle his team in difﬁcult
situations, backing, cramping, turning
around, without speaking a word. At
any rate, please remember, whoever you
are who drive, that your horse has no
need of an ear trumpet to hear you.

Shaler Matthews, speaking about the
white man’s burden, says “The white
man’s burden is largely composed of loot
which the white man has taken from his
yellow friend and brown brother.

A well-known bank president says, “If “
I had twenty tongues I would preach
politeness with them all, for a long ex-
perience has taught me that the results
are tangible and inevitable. Politeness
is the Aladdin’s lamp of success.”

He who can speak of a worn-out horse
as an “old skate,” or of a homeless dog
as a “cur,” is probably the sort of man
ready to call an Italian laborer a “Dago,”
a Hebrew a “Sheeney,” and Negroes and
Chinamen and men of other nationali-
ties besides his own, by names of con-
tempt. By our words we are judged.
They are revelations of our inmost souls.

To Cheer the Heart

Louise Darcy

In times of crisis these are things

To cheer the heart: the flight of wings
Against a flaming sunset sky;

Deer stepping lightly, swiftly by;

A cat that rubs against your legs;

A dog that holds out paws and begs,
That looks at you and seems to know
Just what has made you worry so.
These silent creatures help one bear
The troubled days, the doubt and care;
Beside the hearth, in woodland lane,
Through darkest days they will remain.

Today’s War Pigeons

L. E. EUBANKS

T was only to be expected that the

incredible ingenuity of the warring
nations would get around to demands of
the carrier pigeons for more varied work
and longer hours.

The English patrol hasn’t much fear
of a solitary parachute jumper when the
Nazi sneaks in at night—not of the man
himself. But what that fellow carries
makes his prompt capture highly im-
portant. It is a wicker basket containing
two or more pairs of homing pigeons.
They are lodged in previously selected
lofts and released with messages for the
German Intelligence when the occasion
arises.

Not to be outdone, the British have
adopted an old stunt which was origin-
ated toward the end of the ﬁrst World
War. Small gas balloons are ﬁtted with
metal rings that open automatically at
a predetermined time. Pigeons are placed
in baskets equipped with small para-
chutes. When wind and weather permit,
the baskets are snapped onto the metal
rings and the balloons sent sailing into
enemy occupied territory.

After the lapse of a certain period of
time, the metal rings part, allowing pi-
geons and baskets to descend gently to
earth. Within each basket is a message
asking friendly French, Dutch, Czech or
other allies for deﬁnite information valu-
able to the English. The ﬁnders are in—
structed to slip the answer into a con-
tainer on the pigeon’s foot and release
the bird. The bird nearly always does
its part, and the next morning English
bombers may be unusually fortunate in
locating ammunition factories, airdromes
and troop concentrations.

British mine sweepers and trawlers,
not equipped with wireless, carry pi-
geons along for emergencies. When dan-
ger threatens in the North Sea or Eng-
lish Channel, the birds are sent winging
from 50 to 100 miles to shore for help.

The United States Army used pigeons
only occasionally until 1917. In 1886 cer—
tain far-seeing officials had predicted

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

extensive use of pigeons and ’ "1;"
recommended that provi- .
sions be made for their
maintenance in the Army;
but nothing was done about
it until the need developed
in the ﬁrst World War,
when provision was made to
make pigeons a part of the
United States Signal Corps.
Today, not to be behind in
any element of preparedness,
Uncle Sam has expert pi—
geoneers working day and
night to breed, condition and
train our “pigeon army.”
Over a period of years
methods of breeding and
training have resulted in
striking improvements of
speed and stamina. At one
time a sustained ﬂight of
200 miles a day was con-
sidered excellent, and a mile
a minute was thought to be

 

 

 

 

“OLD BOB” OF OKLAHOMA

 

the limit of speed. Today,
however, the pigeon that falters at a
500-mile-a-day stretch is not considered
worth keeping for war purposes. Some
fast Army birds have breasted the
breezes at over 70 miles an hour.

Trainers are proud, too, for the prog-
ress in night ﬂying. Formerly, a pigeon
would ﬂy from sunrise to dusk, then pick
out a convenient tree or pole and wait
for the break of dawn. The Army now
.has a body of trained flyers who can be
relied upon to carry messages either by
day or in the darkest of nights.

“Tawny” a Noble Lion

It is now two years since the famous
African lion, “Tawny,” passed away and
was buried in the Pet Cemetery at Los
Angeles. Several accounts of this re-
markable animal have been published
since he was adopted by his devoted
owner, Mary E. McMillan, in 1918, and
tenderly reared by her from cubhood to
maturity.

Many of our readers will be interested
in knowing that a ﬁtting memorial was
dedicated to Tawny on December 14,
1941. This memorial marker is of gray
granite which bears the following in-
scription:

1918 1940

“TAWNY” African Lion

With malice toward none, he bore the
adversities of his life with mankind.
Gentle, lifelong protector of his adored
Tomcat pal, who sleeps beside him
' here.
Beloved, always faithful companions of
Mary McMillan who reared them
together with loving kindness.

“Adored and cared for by a human
friend,
A sweet companionship unto the end.”

 

A Famous Quail

M. E. MELVIN

LD BOB” is perhaps the most photo—

graphed quail in the United States,
certainly one of the most famous. He
seems to like publicity since he offers no
objection to a camera.

He is a symbol as well as a “char-
acter.” A symbol, because he represents
a scientiﬁc effort to raise quail for re-
lease to wild life. Quail raising in the
back yard has become popular with many
of the youth of the nation. Much infor-
mation on the technique is available to-
day that was lacking a few years ago.
Boys all over the country are raising
quail and protecting them after they are
released, thus helping to restock areas
of the country where they had been well
nigh destroyed.

Old Bob is a real character in his own
right. He and his mate belong to the
State of Oklahoma, sheltered and cared
for at the State Game Farm near El
Reno. He has old-fashioned views about
raising a family. He wanted a large fam-
ily but Mrs. Bob did not see it that way.
Old Bob begged, fussed, and even threat-
ened his spouse, but he could not induce
her to stay on her nest for hatching. So,
he gave up and took a well—I’ll—show—you
attitude and did the job all himself,
without a day’s help from his helpmate.
Then came a nice brood. Mrs. Bob got
interested and wanted some of the credit.
The Old Man would have none of it and

. actually fought her off.

Incidentally, it is not generally known
that the male quail divides time with his
partner in hatchng a brood. Old Bob had
to put in full time. Mrs. Bob deserves
some credit, for at last reports she had
produced in one season 121 eggs.

Park Animals’ Food Needs

ECAUSE of wartime restrictions,

many of us who would ordinarily
have gone far aﬁeld for our vacations,
probably spent our time in nearby state
or county parks. This fact in itself is
commendable; we aided in the ﬁght for
victory and at the same time rediscovered
nature. This same situation, however,
in at least one instance led to a serious
food shortage for the many of our animal
friends who inhabit these parks.

This is indicated in a current state—
ment from Bear Mountain State Park,
New York, after an unprecedented in-
ﬂux of visitors over the recent Labor Day
weekend. The report stated that a seri-
ous situation for the squirrels, chip-
munks and birds was created by the
crowds eating the fruit from the trees in
deserted orchards on which the numer-
ous animals have depended for years.

There are a hundred or more deserted
farms, many of them very old, deep in
the many recesses of the park. Most of
the buildings are down, but the apple,
cherry and peach trees in these old farms
still remain. Yearly the furred and feath-
ered denizens of the park have been
accustomed to feed on the fruits or gather
the seeds and nuts for winter storage. It
appears the animals won’t get very much
this year. The campers cleaned them
out, many Visiting remote areas seldom
reached before by the transient hikers.

This situation may have repeated it-
self in many other parks throughout the
country. Countless numbers of these
friendly animals to whom we turn for
pleasure and relaxation from the stress
of routine, may unnecessarily suﬁer from
a predicament created entirely by
thoughtlessness. It is a condition that
should not be repeated. In our search
for play and pleasure we should not lose
sight of the harm we may do these birds
and animals in seemingly harmless pur—

suits. ALAN A. BROWN

When a snake rears his head and
waves it sideways, darting his tongue
faster than the eye can follow, he is not
necessarily aiming to bite. He is only
listening, with his tongue trying to de-
tect vibrations in the air. He does not
inject poison with his tongue either.
The majority of snakes are not only
harmless but really helpful to the farmer
and the gardener.

Endowed stalls and kennels are needed
in the Angel] Memorial Animal Hospital.
Payments of thirty-ﬁve dollars for a
kennel or seventy-ﬁve dollars for a stall
will insure a suitable marker inscribed
with donor’s name. Terms of permanent
endowment of free stalls and kennels
will be given upon application to the
Treasurer, 180 Longwood Avenue, Boston.

Master Builders of the Animal World

WILBERT NATHAN SAVAGE

 

TIRELESS TOILERS ARE THE BEAVERS

OU have, undoubtedly, ofttimes

heard the common expression, “as

busy as a beaver.” But you will
never fully understand or appreciate the
saying unless you are fortunate enough
to have the opportunity of seeing these
interesting water animals at work, for
they are among the most intelligent and
industrious of all animals, and their
homes and dams are perfect examples of
the acme of animal skill.

When a colony of beavers decide to
build a dam, the ﬁrst step is the selec-
tion of a suitable site. After a narrow
place on a stream has been chosen by
those in the colony in charge of engineer-
ing, the bottom of the stream-bed is
tested to make sure it is ﬁrm enough to
prevent underwash after the dam is
completed.

Then the work of felling timber is
begun—beavers usually work only at
night—and every beaver works. There
are no superintendents or timekeepers or
paymasters. Every beaver does what he
thinks best, and there are no labor
troubles. Some say the beaver plans for
a tree to fall a certain way; others dis-
agree and say they work haphazardly.
In either event they get things accom-
plished, and are able to cut trees up to
eighteen inches in diameter, though
smaller ones, if available, are more desir-
able.

Friends of the beaver encounter much
opposition on the grounds that these
shrewd animals are destructive rodents.
Despite all accusations, a government
pamphlet obtainable through the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, states that far
the greater majority of damage claims
lodged against the beaver are exagger-
ated and, in most cases, negligible.

The beavers are gradually but surely
vanishing. And if more people don’t
take an interest in them and become their
devoted friend, they may perhaps be
doomed to ultimate extinction.

At present we have very few beaver
East of the Mississippi. There are occa-
sional scattered colonies in Pennsylvania,
Maine, Virginia and a few other states.
In Itasca Park, Minnesota, they have
multiplied rapidly under very strict pro-
tection.

Down through the centuries the beaver
has played an important role in the de-
velopment of our country, and no other
animal has been so closely linked with the
adventure and romance of the pioneer
era. Let’s be wise, and guard against
their becoming extinct while there is
yet time!

The swallow ranks highly as an insect
destroyer in every section of our country,
but in the South is particularly valuable
in reducing the boll weevil plague.

Question. It is fast becoming increas—
ingly difﬁcult to Obtain the fresh ham-
burg and canned dog foods to which my
dog is accustomed. I should like to know
what we are to feed our animals as cus-
tomary foods become scarce in wartime.

Answer. Dogs do not require the
quantities of lean fresh meat often fed
to them by their conscientious owners.
Indeed, the poorer grades of meat and
the internal organs are often preferable.
Animals, like humans, require proteins,
carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and min-
erals; and an adequate diet must contain
all of these in sufﬁcient quantity.

In lieu of fresh beef and lamb cuts,
other sources of protein may be fed.
Horse meat is excellent food for dogs,
and many of the markets now carry it
in a frozen state. Boiled ﬁsh, thoroughly
boned, or ground ﬁsh may be fed. Table
scraps, milk, eggs, and cheese are items
of which we still have sufﬁcient. The
hunter or chicken farmer will feed dis-
carded portions of rabbits, chickens, etc.
Marrow bones, meat and bone meals,
soups and stews made from bones and
scraps may all be fed as sources of
protein.

As for carbohydrates, dog biscuits are
still in abundance on the market. Nearly
any of the dry breakfast cereals or cooked
cereals are excellent foods. Stale bread
or rice may also be fed.

Fats are often discarded when they
would be deeply appreciated by the ca—
nine members of the family. For example,
fats skimmed from soups, bacon or
sausage drippings, bacon rind, fat
trimmed from beef or lamb, or scraps of
cheese Will nourish the dog. Contrary
to the opinion of many dog owners, fat
is a necessary adjunct to the diet; it
furnishes energy and aids in proper
elimination.

Vitamins, much discussed among peo-
ple, are necessary for health. They are
Obtained in milk, raw meat, fruits, and
vegetables, especially the green and yel-
low vegetables. Vegetables and fruits
should be cooked and mashed, with the
exception of green vegetables such as
lettuce and chopped cabbage. The addi-
tion of ﬁsh 0118 is recommended for the
puppy Which must have more Vitamin D
in order to build strong bones.

Minerals are obtained in meat, milk,
ﬁsh, fruits, vegetables, blood and bone
meals, marrow bones.

The dog should always have plenty of
fresh water available.

The quantity Of food necessarily varies
with the size, breed, sex, age, and amount
of exercise taken by the individual dog.

Probably many dog owners will wish
to feed the new dehydrated foods which
are rapidly gaining in popularity. Some

The need of this was illustrated by a
feature cartoon by Halladay in the J our-
nal. Twenty—nine prizes were awarded
to boys and girls participating in the
annual Kindness Week pet show.

Camera Exchange in Pittsburgh, Pa.

A feature of the observance by the
Western Pennsylvania Humane Society
in Pittsburgh was the exchange of cam—
eras for sixty air riﬂes and B B guns that
were surrendered by school pupils. The
Society conducted a school poster con-
test in which 2,500 posters were entered.
The awards included 65 medals, 2O spe-
cial prizes of books, pen and pencil sets,
etc., and more than 600 merit certiﬁ—
cates. Letters and literature were mailed
by the Society to all ministers, and Hu-
mane Week posters, suggestions for ap-
propriate exercises and leaﬂets on the
care of pets during air raids were sup-
plied to schools of the city and suburbs.

Best Humane Week Yet in Virginia

From our colored representative in
Virginia, the Rev. J. W. Lemon: “Hu-
mane Week was the best one that we
have had. I had more engagements in
the schools than I could ﬁll. Had articles
in two papers. Secured ministers to
preach suitable sermons on Humane Sun-
day. Made talks and addresses in schools
and churches. The teachers and chil—
dren gladly co-operated. I distributed

many posters and a quantity of humane
literature.”

Georgia Celebrates Widely

Announced by the usual ofﬁcial Proc-
lamation by Governor Eugene Talmadge,
Be Kind to Animals Week in Georgia
was marked by general observance on
the part of the schools, unusual activities
by P. T. A. groups, and co-operation by
the Federal Works Agency of the Work
Projects Administration of the state.
The Agency released practical sugges—
tions on the care of animals during air
raids, which went to many W. P. A.
workers. Mrs. Katherine Weathersbee,
representing the American Humane Edu-
cation Society, gave as many as eight or
ten talks each day in the schools of
Atlanta. At a meeting of the Atlanta
P. T. A. Council Dr. Willis A. Sutton,
superintendent of schools, spoke on “The
Value of Humane Education in Charac—
ter Education,” and Dr. J. E. Severin
talked on the practical care of animals.
The Atlanta Journal ran a series of
illustrated feature articles.

Many Radio Programs in South Carolina

Governor R. M. Jefferis of South Caro—
lina, in his Proclamation, referred to
Henry F. Lewith of that state as the
originator of the expression “Be Kind
to Animals,” and urged that “parents
and teachers encourage in children a
sympathetic understanding of animals

and respect for the rights of these
friends and helpers of mankind.” School
ofﬁcials and the press cordially endorsed
the Week. Both the State, Columbia,
and the Columbia Record, as well as
numerous other newspapers, gave wide
publicity to the celebration.

Seymour Carroll, representing the
American Humane Education Society,
arranged for twenty-three radio pro-
grams over stations in Columbia, Charles—
ton, Sumter, Greenwood, Anderson, Spar—
tanburg and Greenville, S. C., Charlotte,
N. C., and Augusta, Ga. Miss M. E.
Holloway, director of dramatics at the
Howard school, Columbia, wrote and di-
rected a play that was heard on Station
WIS in that city.

Mr. Carroll supplied press releases to
all the weekly newspapers in South
Carolina, as well as many of the dailies,
and to nearly all the Negro newspapers
in the United States.

Week Proclaimed in New Mexico

As he has done in former years, Gov—
ernor John E. Miles of New Mexico
issued an ofﬁcial Proclamation. After
designating the dates for the Week, he
said: “I recommend that organizations
and schools arrange programs on the
proper care and treatment of our d0'-
mestic animals and that a major topic
be the suggestion of the National Coun-
cil of Defense which emphasizes the im-
portant part the horse, the mule, the
burro and the dog play in the war effort.”

terrifying—if we could but see into the
curious depths of these eyes and fathom
the nnknowable within the little brain
hidden away there. -

“Ah! if only for a moment we could
put ourselves in its place and afterward
remember, what an instantaneous and
deﬁnite solution—though no doubt ter-
rifying enough—we might obtain of the
perplexing problem of life and eternity!

“How mystifying is the affection of
animals! It denotes something lofty,
something superior in those natures
about which we know so little. And how
well I can understand Mohammed, who,
in response to the chant of the Muezzin
summoning him to prayer, cut off with
a pair of scissors the hem of his cloak
before rising to his feet, for fear of dis—
turbing his cat which had settled thereon
to sleep.” Thus Pierre Loti.

Huysmans once said: “In the matter
of animals I love only cats, but I love
them unreasonably for their qualities
and in spite of their numerous faults.
I have only one, but I could not live
without a cat.”

Francois Coppeé employed a physi-
cian to attend his favorites, who told
him, “These are not the ﬁrst literary
cats I have had the honor of caring for.
I was also the physician for the cats of
M. Paul de Kock.” Of the latter Van
Vechten says, “Paul de Kock was a true
feline enrage’.”

Charles Baudelaire also had an intense
passion for the feline domestica, which
he immortalized in poems available to
English readers through the recent
translation of his “Fleurs du Mal.” His
rapture for cats is expli'cable on the
premise of his hypersensitiveness, the
extreme complexity—gross animalism to
asceticism—of his nature, so markedly
enabling him to comprehend, if one can,
the dignity of the gutter cat and the vul-
garity frequently displayed by the
haughtiest and most guarded of feline
pets.

Baudelaire ran the gamut from gross
sensuality to renunciation and herein
lies his deep sense of a creature so akin
to his own world. The worshipful re-
gard in which the animal is held by
many of the ﬁnest minds is as inexpli-
cable as the dread, the fear, the horror
engendered in others by the mere pres—
ence, even though unseen, of the most
ordinary feline.

Endowed stalls and kennels are needed
in the Angell Memorial Animal Hospital.
Payments of thirty-ﬁve dollars for a
kennel or seventy-ﬁve dollars for a stall
will insure a suitable marker inscribed
with donor’s name. Terms of permanent
endowment of free stalls and kennels
will be given upon application to the
Treasurer, 180 Longwood Avenue, Boston.

MAVIS MCLELLAN

F animals could talk, some might de-
mand that their names be changed.

Several might protest against the use
of their good names 'by others less de-
serving. The cat family—noted for
cleanliness-could bring suit for slander
because its name has been given to un—
related animals with powerful scent
glands.

How horriﬁed the family cat would
be to hear us call the skunk a wood
pussy, or, worse yet, a polecat! For the
European polecat is a weasel-like crea-
ture which produces an unpleasant scent
when alarmed.

The African civet cat, a fox-like ani-
mal, secretes a musky substance called
civet. Its name has been unjustly passed
on to our own southwestern civet cat,
a slender odorless animal related to the
raccoon. Apparently, it was given this
offensive name merely because its bushy
tail with seven white bands resembles
the banded tail of the African civet cat.

Ironically, one of the biggest and ﬁn-.

est looking cats is called a mountain
lion! The Spaniards who settled in
South America called this powerful cat,
“the Christian’s Friend,” because it did
not molest them, or harm their children
at play in the wilderness. Like a big
kitten, it likes to play hide and seek with
itself, and try to catch butterﬂies.

The squirrel clan also might protest
because one of its most amusing mem-

Instead, we call it a prairie dog.

Have you ever seen a picture of a
Rocky Mountain Goat? Standing on
some jagged rock, with his shaggy white
coat outlined against the sky, he looks
very bold. Yet, when being hunted, he
is foolish enough to peep around the
corner, just to see if he is really being
followed. In fact, he is a rather stupid
alpine antelope, whose name maligns the
clever goat tribe.

And how a horse would snort to hear
his worthy name bestowed upon a huge,
three-ton creature with a stomach ten
feet long, who eats ﬁve or six bushels of
grass for breakfast, and is related to
the pig! For the Greek word, hippopot-
amus, really means river horse. Next
time you see one, you may notice that
its head—viewed from the side—slightly
resembles the head of a horse. And so
does the proﬁle of a ﬁve-inch ﬁsh which
we call a sea horse.

Because of its name, few people care
to meet a kangaroo rat. But friendly
Mr. Roo, with the big black eyes and
long tufted tail, is neither kangaroo nor
rat. Instead, he is related to the pocket
gopher, and has been called “the hand—
somest of all our rodents.”

The skunk, when de-scented, is easy
to tame. But how few will have one
for a pet? His name might prejudice
the neighbors. Verily, it is harder to
live down a bad name, than to live up
to a good one.

 

A Trio of Unusual Ayrshires

 

N 1938 Clarence M. and Helen V.
1 Smith purchased these three old cows
at a dispersal sale, says the Ayrshire
Digest, to which we are indebted for the
accompanying illustration. Each is still
hale and hearty, and has a cumulative rec-
ord of over 100,000 lbs. milk to her credit.
They are, left to right, “Strathglass Eva—
beauty,” “Piecemaker’s Viola” and “Lena
Great Gift.” Viola has become ambitious

in her old age and is now the progenitress
of a rapidly increasing family in the
Smith herd, where she has a son, a daugh—
ter, two granddaughters and one great
granddaughter. “The Ayrshire wears
like iron,” report Mr. and Mrs. Smith,
who have the evidence to prove it in these
three cows, whose ages total forty-eight
years, which may be seen at their farm
in Franklin, New York.

RABIES, Leslie T. Webster, MD.

From the time of Aristotle right up to
the present day, the problem of rabies has
been one of controversy, misinformation and
often confusion. Many technical articles
have appeared in medical journals, but little
or no attention has been paid to giving the
layman a clear-cut picture of the rabies
problem.

Dr. Webster’s new book, therefore, meets
a popular demand by presenting, in a most
interesting form and in language the lay-
man can appreciate, a review of what has
been accomplished toward a better under—
standing of the disease—its diagnosis and
prevention.

Graphic charts provide the more scientiﬁc
reader or the veterinarian or physician
with detailed information of real value.

Dog owners and executives of societies
for the prevention of cruelty to animals and
humane societies will ﬁnd the book of great
value in obtaining a clear picture of a
problem that faces all engaged in animal
protective work.

COMPANION DOG TRAINING, Hans
Tossuti.

From his many years of training dogs
the author has achieved notable success.
His American record includes more than
3,000 dogs schooled in his classes and over
200 personally trained. His wide experience
embraces the training and handling of dogs
for sport, war service, Red Cross, message
carriers, Police service, blind leading, and
his methods of training, it is claimed, are
adapted to all breeds of dogs.

This book is a very practical manual on
systematic canine obedience. It will prove
especially valuable and helpful not only to
the amateur but to all who would desire a
better understanding and knowledge of the
dog’s mental capacity. It is in reality an
excellent textbook—a guide to be studied
in developing the dog in the best behavior.
There are many striking illustrations which
demonstrate both the correct and incorrect
ways in respect to the dog’s training. That
there will be many dog owners, fanciers and
breeders who will be eager to possess this
new and up—to-date work, we have no doubt.

THE INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION
OF WILDLIFE, Sherman Strong Hay—
den, Ph.D.

Protective legislation with respect to
many forms of wildlife has been largely
enacted in our own and other countries dur-
ing the past century. The co-operation
among the various countries has been effec-
tuated from a realization «that the world’s
wildlife was threatened with actual deple-
tion even in some species to extermination.

The purpose of this essay, the author
states, is threefold: “(1) to examine the
history of certain particular situations
which could only be resolved by the joint
activity of two or more governments, (2)
to expound in detail the attempted remedies,
and (3) to enquire how far the remedies
thus attempted have succeeded.”

The protection that is now accorded to
many species of bird and animal life has
been won by a long list of conventions,
agreements and treaties, which are appar-
ently fully recorded in this substantial vol-
ume. The efforts [put forth and the progress
made in preserving the natural habitats of
wildlife are an honor to the men and the
societies who have devoted themselves to a
noble cause.

NIGHTHAWK OR BULL-BAT

A Forest Lesson
JACK KYTLE

NE golden day in October some time
ago, I walked through a stretch of
vari—colored forest with my Negro friend,
Gross Stone, the almost constant compan—
ion of my boyhood and my teacher in the
ways of nature. We were idling along
beside a rail fence when he paused sud-
denly and placed his hand on my arm.
“Look over yonder,” he said. “Now that’s
what I call a beautiful sight.”

For a moment, as I peered on the line
of his pointed ﬁnger, I saw only the fence.
But then, perched lengthwise upon a top
rail, the outline of a bird emerged from
the green, yellow, and red background of
leaves. After sitting perfectly still for a
few seconds, it turned its head rapidly
from side to side, then darted away.

“I hope you got a good look at it,”
Gross said, “so you’ll never forget it.
Don’t ever harm a feather of that bird,
for it’s a bull-bat.”

He went on to explain then, in his deep
understanding of wildlife, that we had
looked for those few moments upon one
of man’s staunchest friends. The bull-
bat, or nighthawk, he said, destroys num-
berless mosquitoes, gnats, parasitic ﬂies,
winged ants, beetles, and other noxious
creatures.

I have never forgotten that forest
lesson, and the sight of one of these proud
birds has always brought it back to my
mind.

It is a picture in grace. During pas-
sage from one section to another, it ﬂies
swiftly, using perfectly-timed, straight-
forward wing strokes. When feeding, the
ﬂight is more erratic, so that it seems
sometimes to almost come to a stop in
mid-air. But even at this time, it re-
mains poised and balanced in every move.

Perhaps the nighthawk’s most fasci-
nating and spectacular feat while ﬂying
is its lightning-like dives. At the time
of nesting, it ﬂies upward to a consider-

able height, then ﬂashes almost straight
down to within a few inches of the
ground. Arresting its dive ﬁnally, its
strong wings produce a clearly-audible
booming note.

Although it is a relative of the noc-
turnal whippoorwill, the nighthawk ven-
tures forth a great deal during daylight
hours. It is especially active in the after-
noons along the banks of shaded, mean-
dering streams, where mosquitoes tend
to gather. During the middle of the day,
it rests leisurely for the most part upon
a fence, log, or limb, but the sight of it
ﬂying in bright sunshine is not unusual.

A S‘killful Fisherman

SUSIE M. BEST

THE brilliantly colored European king-
ﬁsher, which is found in almost all
countries of Europe, scarcely seems re-
lated to his larger and more sedately
dressed American brother, known as the
belted kingﬁsher, yet, despite the differ—
ence in size and plumage, the birds are
of one family. In both species the head
is large in proportion to the body and
carries a noble-looking crest which turns
backward. The bill is long and pointed
and the tail and legs are short. A stout
membrane unites the outer and middle
toes thus enabling the bird to dart into
the water after its prey.

These birds are expert ﬁshermen, their
favorite haunts being places along the
sandy banks of rivers and brooks. Sta—
tioned on a high branch of a tree over-
looking the stream, the kingﬁsher keeps
a sharp lookout on the water. Let an
unwary ﬁsh swim into sight and sud-
denly you will hear a dip and a splash.
The ﬁsh is caught and carried ashore
where the bird beats it to death on a
tree and then devours it.

There are a number of traditions con-
cerning the kingﬁsher, one of which is
alluded to by the poet Shakespeare, who
tells us that if the dead body of this bird

Lovely, snowy-feathered swan,
Nesting by the silver lake,

All your gliding movement gone
For the future's sake,

Are you speaking silently
To your little unborn crew?

Are you dreaming days to be
As all mothers do?

Are you pondering at heart
On the everlasting things?

Knowing life must life impart
To the world of wings?

All the human world is strife;
Every covenant a wraith.

Nations are destroying life.
You are keeping faith.

 

is stuffed and hung by a thread, it will
become a weather vane, the bill always
pointing to the direction from which
the wind blows.

According to another story from Greek
tradition, the bird is identiﬁed with a
maiden named Halcyone, who was wedded
to a youth called Ceyx. Shortly after the
marriage Ceyx was lost at sea. Halcyone,
learning this, was in great grief and
threw herself in the sea in order to
perish with him. Whereupon, the gods in
compassion, changed the two into king—
ﬁshers, decreeing that they should build
their nest on the water and that during
the mating season, which was seven days
before and seven days after the shortest
day of the year, only calm weather should
prevail. Hence those days came to be
called “Halcyon days,” an expression in

common use to typify a season of quiet
peace and happiness.

of these foods are splendid, and your
veterinarian can advise you as to the
best ones to select. To these one can add
milk or melted fat in preference to simply
water. Table scraps may also be mixed
with these dry foods.

Once your dog becomes accustomed to
his changed diet, he will be as contented
as he was with his canned food and fresh
hamburg. Although it becomes necessary
to ration some foods and to go without
others, there remains sufﬁcient to feed
our dogs if we but change their eating
habits. In England the dog owner may
have to deprive himself in order to feed
his dog, but here it is still only a question
of adjusting his diet to those foods which
are still present in abundance.

Pets and Children

In the home children should be taught
to care for their pets, to be gentle and
patient with them, to feed and water
them regularly.

This way they will develop sense of
responsibility and thoughtfulness, and
their pets will repay them for their kind—
ness by faithfulness and devotion.

Through humane education we may
counteract the evil effects of brutality
so that children may be imbued with the
high ideals of compassion and love of
justice.

Kindness springs from the heart, and
by instilling in the minds of the children
right thinking as to their relationship
towards animals and their fellow-beings
we will pave the way for the reconstruc-
tion which must come.

Martyrs for Freedom
VINCENT EDWARDS

T is impossible to sit through that
recent movie “Eagle Squadron” with-
out being stirred to a liking for the play-
ful kitten that one of the Yankee ﬂyers
in the RAF. carries along as a mascot.
At the end of the picture when a Com-
mando raid has been successfully carried
on a German airﬁeld, the torn, broken
body of this faithful creature is shown
lying alongside a dead Briton—as much
a martyr in the ﬁght as the brave men
themselves.

This incident recalls a long record of
the heroism of animals in the last war.
Who can ever forget “Bruce,” the staunch
little Scottish terrier in the British
Navy? When the great battleship H .M .S.
Formidable was sinking, Captain Loxley
was last seen standing calmly on the
bridge, a cigarette between his lips and
a quiet smile lighting his face. And right
beside him, just as calm and untroubled,
stood Bruce, ready to share with his
master their last great adventure to-
gether.

Not all aboard H.M.S. Formidable
drowned. One seaman by the name of
Jack Cowan was rescued and brought
ashore in an unconscious condition. He
was taken into a hotel at Lyme Regis
and efforts made to revive him, but all
in vain. Then a strange thing happened.
A shaggy-coated collie called “Lassie”
stole into the kitchen where Cowan’s
body was lying, walked over to the sea-
man, then lay down beside him and began
to lick his face. She kept it up steadily
for half an hour or more. All at once a
faint moan was heard from the suppos-
edly dead man, which was followed by a
slight moVement of his body. The people
watching resumed their respiration ef-
forts, and Cowan was soon brought
around. Thanks to a devoted dog, his
life was saved.

It was because of such loyalty and
sacriﬁce on the part of animals that the
Bishops of the Church of England were
glad to give ear to a request of the Royal
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals and have a special prayer read
in all the churches. This prayer is so ﬁne
and appropriate that it is doubtless being
used in the present war. It reads:

“And for those also, 0 Lord, the
humble beasts, who with us bear the bur-
den and heat of the day, and offer their
guileless lives for the well-being of their
countries, we supplicate Thy great ten-
derness of heart for Thou hast promised
to save both man and beast, and great
is Thy loving—kindness, 0 Master, Sa-
viour of the world. Lord have mercy.
Amen.”

Please remember the American Hu-
mane Education Society, Boston, in
your will.

New Year
d e r

I would have this new year bring

Soft and warm the dancing rain

To make the hills turn bright with grass,
To make the fields grow gold with grain.

Judy Van Veer

And I would have it bring much sun
To warm the hidden calves asleep,
And dry the rain from curly coats
Of little lambs and mother sheep.

And I would have it bring small winds
For all the colts that like to run

And play across the shining grass,
And kick at shadows in the sun.

And I would have this year be kind

To wild things like the birds and tawns,
For all the turtive hunted ones

Bring sheltered nights and friendly dawns.

Guarding the Fur Seals
CLEVE WILLIAMS

EVERY year, the United States gov-

ernment sends out many of its Coast
Guard cutters to protect the young seals.
These pug-nosed infants swim with their
mothers down from their summer resort
on the cold, rocky Pribilof Islands of
Alaska, to bask in the warm waters of
the coast of California.

The little seals have to swim many
hundreds of miles, and naturally they
and their mothers travel very slowly.
That is why the government sends its
cutters to guard them. For if the seals
had no protection,‘cruel pelagic sealers
might hunt them down with motorboats
and riﬂes, and kill them for their fur,
which is very valuable. It is against the
laws of several nations for hunters to
follow the mothers and capture them or
to catch and kill their young.

Long ago the seal hunters slew their
prey relentlessly, until there was danger
that all the seals would be gone. But the
seals never changed the custom of swim-
ming up to Alaska and back down to
warmer waters—just as though they
trusted in some greater power to come
to their help eventually. Finally help
came. The nations held a conference,
and the United States was charged with
the duty of protecting the seals.

Beginning in January, and often even
earlier, mother-seals and father-seals
start swimming from the warm South-
ern waters as far down as Mexico and
back to Pribilof where government ofﬁ-
cers select the seals to be used for fur—
a relatively small number. Coast Guard
cutters then keep hunters away from all
the other seals, which are free to frolic
about the rocks.

At that time, the bleak islands are a
queer sight, with big seals weighing a

ton or more “woofing” majestically, and
tiny seals barking shrilly, trying their
ﬂippers as they wriggle around, and
diving into the sea to catch ﬁsh. Then,
too, the mother-seals are teaching their
pups to stay close to the maternal ﬂip-
pers, lest lurking polar bears catch some
of them.

Because of old treaties with the In-
dians, the red men are still allowed to
hunt seal with bow and arrow. The joke
is that they may only use canoes. It is
hard to catch a seal in a canoe, and
harder still to shoot one with an arrow,
so the seals are not "in much danger.
For rare is the Indian who can boast of
having harmed one of Uncle Sam’s
charges. _

Since the government started protect-
ing seals, their number has increased
until now there are approximately two
millions.

The armadillo, commonly found in
southern Texas, Mexico, and Central
America always has four young and the
four are either all males or all females.
This is the only animal in the world
known to produce its litter of young of
only one sex. They make nice pets and
are easy to care for. They root in the
ground like pigs, hunting for insect-s
and roots. They are protected by a hard
shell which covers the entire body except
the underside.

Turtles are rather sluggish animals
and do not use up much energy. Their
hard shells prevent moisture from escap-
ing from their bodies. They readily store
up fat which serves them well in time of
famine. When necessary they can go
without food for a year.

Giants of the Ice
DOROTHEA K.GOULD

HE polar bear is different from all

other members of the bear family
in that its neck is long, its head is slen-
der and pointed, and it has fur on the
soles of its feet.

This animal can adapt himself to
being a water animal if necessity de-
mands, and if he has to ﬁght for his
food under the ice he is quite capable of
doing so. Although he can plunge into
the water in chase of a salmon and re-
turn with the ﬁsh in his mouth, the
main food of the polar bear is seal and
walrus. If the seal escapes into his hole
through the ice before the polar bear
has had a chance to catch him, this huge,
foxy creature sits patiently and waits
until the seal comes to the surface.

The white fur coating of the polar
bear is so dense that he is immune to
the severest cold. His toes are partly
webbed and his feet are large and ﬂat.
Thus they serve as snowshoes and pad-
dles.

The mother bear sleeps through the
winter in a hole which she has dug for
herself in a snowbank. When she comes
out in the spring she usually has a baby
or two with her—young cubs about as
large as cats.

The father bear does not hibernate,
but roams the ice all through the win-
ter, no matter how severe the cold.

These bears grow sometimes to a
length of thirteen feet, and weigh up to
sixteen hundred pounds. They are also
called ice bears.

The Sad Note

MID the joyful days of the holiday
season it would not harm us to
think for a moment of the immeasurable
volume of suffering endured by the mil-
lions of cattle, sheep, swine, poultry and
game, particularly at this season of the
year, as they are slaughtered for our
tables. No one of our readers can par-
take of any of this food without being
morally responsible for a part of this
needless cruelty, unless, by such inﬂu-
ence as he can exert, he is working for
such humane methods in slaughter as
will bring death to these creatures sacri-
ﬁced for food, with the least possible
fright and pain. Who can say, “I am
doing my best to end the cruelties of the
abattoir and the packing—house?” The
goal is that every such animal be ren-
dered insensible by some instantaneous
method of stunning before the knife is
used.

Results Not Heralded

The Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals is often made the
target of ridicule and criticism. It is not
easy for it to make known the results of
its day-to-day endeavor to ameliorate the
lot of dumb animals. Its beneﬁciaries are
silent. The dog, the horse, the cat or the
pigeon cannot voice their thanks. The
good Samaritan who comes to their re-
lief knows no reward but the “well-done”
of his own conscience. His deed and his
name cannot become the household words
of a neighborhood through the eloquent
gratitude of his object or his tender
ministrations. The horse or the mule
“that hath no understanding” can only
suffer in silence, and cannot ask us to
come to his relief.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

In Defense of the Cat

I 'E called attention some months ago

to the ancient prejudice against

the cat on the ground that one of its

favorite pastimes was to leap upon the

breast of a sleeping child and “take its

breath.” This special proclivity to evil,

charged against the cat from time im—

memorial, we declared to be a creation
of imagination.

The following, from a physician who
has evidently given the matter consid—
eration, has been received and we are
glad to publish it as a very rational ex-
planation of what no doubt has some-
times happened:

“It is most improbable and unnatural
that a cat would ‘take away an infant’s
breath.’ But on the other hand, much
less weight than that of an ordinary—
sized cat on an infant’s breast will
cause death by asphyxiation; respiration
is retarded at once, and if pressure is
directly on the chest, complete occlusion
of oxygen very soon follows and proves
fatal. The cat is spontaneous in its ad-
vances, anticipating sympathy and hos-
pitality, while the dog, with greater
dignity, waits your invitation.

“So it is that puss is found lying up
to your face as you wake, while the dog
is satisﬁed with more remote quarters.”

Reception to Mr. Hansen

One of the outstanding social events
in Holyoke, Massachusetts, was the
reception and «silver tea given to Mr.
Eric H. Hansen, newly elected executive
Vice-president of the Massachusetts
S. P. C. A., by the Holyoke Branch on
Wednesday afternoon, January 14. This
took place at the home of Mrs. William
Whiting, 157 Linden Street, and was
very largely attended by representative
people of the city and vicinity.

Mr. Hansen addressed the company,
telling of the preparations being made
by the allied humane societies of Massa—
chusetts for the protection of animals in
case of air raids. Arrangements for this
very successful gathering were made by
Mrs. Marion S. M. Chapin, chairman of
the program committee.

Billions of Birds

The Bulletin of the Massachusetts
Audubon Society quotes from an article
by a leading bird authority, Roger T.
Peterson, in which Mr. Peterson states
that he had read that the number of
breeding birds in the United States
averaged about ﬁfty to each person. That
would mean about six billions. Figuring
two pairs of birds to the acre, Mr.
Peterson placed the number at over sev-
en billions, but adds that he thinks the
ﬁgures too high. All we can say is, “The
more the better.”

The Word of the Wise

ICTOR HUGO once wrote, “What is

the highest faculty of the soul? Is it
genius? No, it is goodness, kindness.
When there is nothing under the left
breast there can be nothing perfect in
the head. Genius is a great heart.”

Painted on the white rim of an orna—
mental two-wheeled cart ﬁlled with flow-
ers, which we once saw in the court of a
quaint hotel in Normandy, are the words
of Alexandre Dumas. Someone had asked
him if he was fond of animals. His
answer was, “I love animals, but I abhor
beast-s.”

M. Camille Saint-Saens, the great mu-
sician, and the life-long friend of ani-
mals, took into his home a little dog. The
enraged concierge waited his chance and
notiﬁed the owner of the house. Soon a
letter arrived for the musician which
said, “Monsieur, my house is not a zoolo-
gical garden!” Saint-Saens sent back the
answer, “Monsieur, if you wish your
house to be a zoological garden you have
only to live in it.”

Baxter State Park

A recent issue of the Sunday Tele-
gram, Portland, Maine, presents a full
page, with illustrations, of the Baxter
State Park in the region of Mount
Katahdin, Maine. Included is an enlight-
ening article by Former Governor Bax-
ter himself, telling the history of his
efforts to obtain this magniﬁcent park,
now comprising 112,945 acres, for his
beloved state. Failing in his persistent
efforts, begun as early as 1917, to per-
suade the state to purchase this land for
a park, the Governor began, in 1930,
buying up the land himself and gradu-
ally added to his purchases until now
the tract comprises nearly ﬁve town-
ships. For all practical purposes the Park
is now complete, though the benefactor
feels that he may be able to add a few
additional areas later.

“The Park stands right in the center
of the northern portion of our State, a
wild mountainous country forever set
aside and held in Trust by the State as
a public park, forest reserve and wild
life sanctuary for present and future
generations of Maine people,” says Gov-
ernor Baxter.

“This district is typical of the wild
lands of Maine. It has within its bor—
ders, lakes, swamps, beaver dams, rivers,
mountains, good timber lands and burnt-
over lands, meadows and boulders in pro-
fusion. Moose, deer, wild cats, bears,
foxes and all the smaller animals and
birds abound therein. All these creatures
are safe from the hunters and the sound
of the axe and of falling trees never will
echo through these forests.”

eled 12,880 miles to visit nearly 500
schools in which he organized 600 Bands
of Mercy. He delivered 350 school talks
and 100 addresses before adult groups.
He estimates that he reached in all
79,100 persons, nearly 50,000 of them
being children.

Mrs. Weathersbee’s activities in
Georgia were so numerous and so varied
that little justice can be done to them in
this limited space. She found her way
to 81 towns, requiring 12,500 miles of
travel. Her school talks averaged one
for every day in the year except Sun-
days and holidays. They were given in
more than 100 schools where she organ-
ized more than a thousand Bands of
Mercy in which nearly 35,000 pupils were
enrolled. Her talks on the cruelties in—
volved in trained animal acts resulted in
nearly 10,000 Jack London Club pledges.
She attended a great variety of meet-
ings, including Parent-Teachers, Wom-
en’s Clubs, teachers’ conventions, and
summer schools, at several of which she
held humane exhibits, and distributed
more than 15,000 pieces of literature.
Through the Georgia Press Association
she was responsible for about 400 hu-
mane notices in daily and weekly news-
papers.

Mr. Griffith traveled 6,500 miles in
Florida, where he visited 79 different
places. He gave 63 school talks and re-
ported 480 new Bands of Mercy. He still

makes use of a loud speaker which car-
ries his message to thousands on the
streets. Altogether he reached 51,365
persons, of whom 34,440 were pupils.
He made visits to convict camps, CCC
camps, 4—H camps, libraries, police sta-
tions, and ﬁre stations, distributing lit-
erature in each. He secured a Be Kind
to Animals Week proclamation from the
mayor of Deland.

Two Workers in Texas

Mrs. Toomim’s work was interrupted
both in the middle of the year and in the
last month because of sickness. From
January through April she visited
schools in Texas and in Chicago, Illinois,
and in the fall returned to carry on her
work in Texas.

In connection with Be Kind to Animals
Week Mrs. Tomim was instrumental in
having 4,000 copies of our “Humane Ex-
ercises” placed in the schools of Chicago,
through the co—operation of the Illinois
Humane Society, which also furnished 72
cameras awarded in a contest for the
best stories, playlets and poems on kind—
nessto animals by pupils of the sixth and
eighth grades in both public and paro-
chial schools. She wrote and conducted
a radio quiz, arranged for ﬁve radio sta-
tions to carry an announcement of the
Week each day, and secured daily press
notices in all Chicago newspapers during
Be Kind to Animals Week. She gave
more than 200 talks in 59 schools and
organized about a thousand Bands of

M m. 1942

Mercy, with memberships totaling 36,000.

Mr. Barnwell, with headquarters in
Fort Worth, Texas, traveled nearly
10,000 miles in visiting 61 widely sepa-
rated towns in that state. His work is
endorsed by both white and colored edu-
cational leaders. He conferred with
supervisors of Fort Worth schools in
correlating humane education in the
regular school program, and secured a
weekly column on this subject in the
Fort Worth Mimi. He visited 71 schools,
gave 68 school talks, and organized 295
Bands of Mercy, reaching more than
25,000 children. He addressed 55 adult
audiences, aggregating more than 11,000
persons. He also visited numerous
churches, colleges, inter-racial confer—
ences, Women’s clubs, and various con-
ventions including the National Asso-
ciation for Advancement of Colored Peo-
ple. He distributed several thousand
pieces of humane literature.

On the Paciﬁc Coast

Mrs. Park, secretary of the Western
Humane Press Bureau, reports the con—
tinuance of making and mailing press
slips to editors west of the Rocky Moun-
tains, the distribution of books and other
literature, lectures on humane education,
correspondence with many persons of in-
ﬂuence, and considerable travel in central
and southern California. In 1941 her
name was included in an honor list of ten
selected and published by Health News
of Los Angeles. The citation reads:
“Alice Park, Palo Alto, California, hu-
manitarian, for saving lives by persuad—
ing parents not to keep guns where chil-
dren can get at them; and educational
work against cruelty to animals.”

Mrs. Florida L-. Byrne of Tacoma,
Washington, was appointed in Septem-
ber to represent the Society on part time
in the schools of that city. During the
four months she visited 36 schools, Where
literature was distributed. She also
wrote and sent literature to 15 Parent—
Teacher Association presidents.

Extensive Foreign Work

In addition to sending cash amount-
ing to nearly $1,300, for war work
abroad and to aid the cause in the British
West Indies, Ireland, Hungary and
France, the Society contributed litera-
ture to humane workers in Canada, Mex-
ico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Brazil, Peru,
British West Indies, England, Syria,
India, and Northern Rhodesia. To some
of these countries literature in Spanish
was included. Efforts to dispatch cellu-
loid buttons and metal badges to Pales—
tine and Syria were futile. Naturally
the War has curtailed our work abroad,
which depends largely on our being able
to maintain correspondence with repre—
sentatives there.

73,000 horses in England’s coal pits;
now only some 32,000—something to be
grateful for. Mechanical conveyances
more and more taking the place of ﬂesh
and blood.

Ilka Chase, the well—known radio com-
mentator, says in her recent book, “In
San Sebastian I saw my ﬁrst bull ﬁght
and, though we know there are only two
sure things in this world, I am willing
to bet that it was also my last.” She tells
the story of the brutal cruelty involved,
and ends by saying, “Mr. Ernest Hem-
ingway to the contrary, I do not think it
is a beautiful and gallant sport.”

The shelves of our libraries abound in
biographies and autobiographies which
cover a wide ﬁeld in the world’s litera-
ture. It is by no means the man who has
lived the longest life who gets the long—
est biography. Someone has remarked
that the biography of Methuselah, the
world’s oldest man, according to the
story, having lived something like a
thousand years, was written in only six-
teen words.

We read the other day that a certain
native of Finland holds the world’s rec-
ord for the fastest human runner, hav-
ing reached a speed of fourteen miles an
hour. The Texas jack rabbit, it appears,
has a running record of thirty-ﬁve miles
an hour, and the greyhound, of forty-two
miles an hour.

The human mind, however, can beat
that by the million. The mind of the
reader of these words can circle the globe
in less than a fraction of a second. In-
deed it can reach in thought a star whose
light, traveling at the rate of 186,000
miles a second, has taken a million years
to reach our earth.

Yesterday, Today and
Tomorrow !

HIS world never will be, never can

be the same again when this war is
over. It will be, it must be either a bet—
ter world, a ﬁner world, a world in which
justice, fair play, good will, will charac-
terize not only international relations,
but the economic, political and social life
of man, or a world doomed to ever—
increasing hate and bitter nationalism.

There have been great revolutions in
the centuries gone that have changed
the very currents of human history,
that have widened the ﬁeld of human
rights, brought new hope of freedom
and equality for untold millions.

May it be, dare we venture even to
hope, that this vast, devastating war,
covering so much of earth’s land and
sea, where three out of four of the
world’s people are allied against the
hostile few, is to be followed by an-
other great world-wide revolution bring-
ing nearer that far-off day of which
prophet, seer and poet have dreamed?
Can it be that only by such a bitter, hu-
miliating lesson as the world is now
learning, that humanity can be shown
that the way of the transgressor is hard,
that we live in a moral universe and
that God is not mocked, that nations as
well as men reap what they sow?

Yes, we grant it is quite the thing to-
day to smile at the songs sung by such
a Victorian singer as Tennyson. We
have moved far ahead,—have we?——of
those other days when faith dare be—
lieve that there was something back of
man’s age-long story besides chance, or
nothingness at the end? Is there no
longer for our day any welcome music
in Tennyson’s prophetic song:

Saw the Vision of the world, and all the
wonder that would be;

Saw the heavens ﬁll with commerce, ar-
gosies of magic sails,

Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping
down with costly bales;

Heard the heavens ﬁll with shouting,
and there rain’d a ghastly dew

From the nations’ airy navies grappling
in the central blue;

Far along the world-wide whisper of the
south-wind rushing warm,

With the standards of the peoples plung—
ing thro’ the thunderstorm;

Till the war-drum throbb’d no longer,
and the battle—flags were furl’d

In the Parliament of man, the Federa-
tion of the world.

The Negro} and the War

After addressing thousands of colored
men and women, including shipyard
workers, ministers, farmers, teachers
and editors, an accredited writer says:

“One reason alone was responsible for
these vast outpourings of anxious-faced
men and women. . It. was their bewilder-
ment and resentment against Army,
Navy, and defense industry jim-crow,
the abuse of Negro soldiers, the dis—
crimination by the Red Cross against
use of Negro blood for blood plasma,
and the whole ridiculous philosophy of
racial discrimination from which the
Negro suffers even as he is being asked
to help again to defend democracy.”

Furthermore, in February last, twenty-
seven of the most representative colored
men and women in the country sent an
appeal to President Roosevelt to abolish
the exclusion of Negroes from the war
effort and to give them something to
hope and ﬁght for.

Isolation Ward Opened at Angel] Animal Hospital

Trustees, Directors and Ofﬁcers of Massachusetts S. P. C. A. Dedicate Newly Equipped Rooms
to John R. Macomber

N the presence of distinguished rep-
resentatives of the trustees and direc—
tors of the Massachusetts S. P. C. A.,
as well as of the ofﬁcers of the Society,
the John R. Macomber isolation ward,
on the top ﬂoor of the Angel] Memorial
Animal Hospital, Boston,'was dedicated
on April 30 by simple but impressive
exercises. This ward, unique of its kind
and unequalled in equipment by any
similar one anywhere, will be used for
treating dogs with distemper and other
communicable canine diseases.

In a brief address President Rowley
paid a glowing tribute to the trustees
and directors of the Society, saying:
“For more than 32 years that I have
served as president, no organization has
had a more loyal and unselﬁsh board of
trustees and directors guiding its des-
tinies. Every member on our board has
served efﬁciently, cheerfully and without
remuneration. This beautiful new ward,
which will help to relieve the pain and
suffering of stricken animals, is named
‘The John R. Macomber Ward,’ in recog-
nition of his deep sympathy for the
cause of animals and his generous and
helpful services as a trustee for a quar-
ter of a century.”

Mr. Macomber responded in a few
well chosen words of thanks and appre-

ciation, and Vice-President Hansen ex—
plained brieﬂy the extent of the equip-
ment and how it will be used. Then
Dr. E. F. Schroeder, chief veterinarian
of the Hospital staff, conducted the party
through the ward and pointed out the
various features and described the meth-
ods of procedure.

The visitors were greatly interested
in all that they saw, and especially in
the electric sterilizing lamp, the ultra
violet rays of which are largely effec-
tive in destroying all air—borne bacteria.
All who enter the ward, veterinarians,
attendants, and visitors, will be obliged
to stand under this lamp for about a
minute as a safeguard against infection,
before they leave. The ward, ﬁtted with

And all the wisdom that man's arts can teach,

I could not offer worship more than lies

Within the depths of my adoring eyes.

You are the only god my heart may know —

Grant me the mercy that a god can show.

I serve you silently and am content

That thus the brief span of my years be spent.

I live for you, and many of my breed

Have died in answering to human need.

Because of all the homage that I give,

Let me in comfort and in plenty live,

Knowing that gentleness in words and ways

For more than meat and drink, my love
repays.

Through life, I am your friend and willing
slave,

When you are called by death, I guard
your grave;

And so, I dare to pray that you may be

Kind to all helpless things, because of me.

Beloved “Bozo”

EVELYN B. WITTER

OZO,” a bulldog, showed so plainly

in his intelligent affectionate way
that in his heart he bore a deep love for
all humanity, that he became a town
character.

Although no one owned Bozo, almost
everyone in Rock Island, Illinois, knew
him and loved him, for he had been a
familiar ﬁgure in the downtown district
for more than twenty years.

In all those years he had proved his
true character. For example: children
liked to play With the good-natured dog.
When their play became too rough, Bozo
never showed signs of anger. He’d
merely turn away and with a backward
glance which clearly said, “That’s
enough now children,” and then he’d
walk away.

Because Bozo willingly offered his
comforting companionship to all sorts of
people, he had many friends. Bozo’s
friends did all in their power to repay
him for his faithfulness.

Two restaurant owners fed him every
day. Bozo’s special fondness for sweets
was well known to the candy man who
gave him tasty tidbits whenever he
asked for them.

The laundry man was always glad to
have Bozo’s company as he made his
regular route. At times, when Bozo had
a strong urge to see the town, he would
wait in the truck early in the morning
and perhaps ride with his friend all day.

The policeman who patrolled the down-
town district saw to it that Bozo was
allowed to sleep in the park during the
hot weather. A night-watchman provided
him with a nice warm bed near a furnace
all through the winter.

“JACK,” RESCUER OF DROWNING
BOY

 

Another one of Bozo’s very good
friends was the captain of the Mississippi
River ferry boat that carried passengers
from Rock Island to Davenport, Iowa.
Bozo was given the run of the boat when-
ever he chose to ride across the river.

One Christmas several of Bozo’s
friends gave him a handsome collar of
which he was justly proud.

The year after that Bozo was picked
up by the dog catcher because he had
no license. The dog catcher did not know
the dog very well, but like most people
he sensed that certain trust and good
will that Bozo radiated toward everyone.
Even a man, Whose business it was to dis-
pose of dogs could not dispose of this
one! He called the police station about
it. The police in turn told the patrol-
man, who told a downtown merchant,
who bought the license and saved Bozo
from the pound. This friend bought
the license every year from that time on.

When Bozo’s time was ﬁnally up, in
April, 1942, he was laid to rest in the
town’s most fashionable pet cemetery.

Ofﬁcer Blade], who had so often helped
Bozo across the busy streets when he
had become too old to dodge nimbly be-
tween onrushing cars, says: “Some
people say Bozo was just a lucky dog.
But I say Bozo was a dog that had faith
in all men, and believed there was plenty
of good in every person he met. No man
could resist a trust like that. That’s why
no one ever let him down.”

 

 

“BRUNO,” GUARDIAN OF LOST
CHILD

F special interest each year in Lon—
don is the annual dog show. One
section is marked off by the sign:

“V. C. dogs. Heroes every one!”

Here are to be seen members of the
canine family of many sorts and sizes—
all the way from a Great Dane of highest
pedigree, to a little mongrel Skye terrier.
Each animal wears the same sort of
collar—a blue leather one with a dan-
gling silver medal which reads, “For
bravery.”

These dogs are all members of the
Victoria Cross Club for dogs, organized
some years ago by a great London weekly.
Membership is limited to dogs who have
actually risked their lives to save a
human being. Since its foundation many
dogs have been given the coveted collar.
Some of these dogs have performed deeds
of the greatest heroism. In the big book,
containing the Club’s “Roll of Honor,”
may be found the name of each dog
member and the record of his deed.

“Jack” saved a boy from drowning.
“Bob” rescued a baby from a miry gravel
pit. “Bruno” watched over a child 10st
in a forest until it was found by its
parents. “Nip” gave timely warning to
his master and mistress, when the house
was on ﬁre at night, by scratching at
their door and barking loudly. In mak-
ing his own escape this faithful dog had
to jump from an upstairs balcony, and
so injured his legs that he has had to
wear leg supports ever since.

A Bird Haven

A. LEONARD BUTTS

BIRDS have been attracted to our yard
in large numbers by copious growth
of shrubs and trees. Privet hedge which
partly forms the background is especially
useful as a shelter for birds. Such an
informal growth of privet hedge thus
produces small berries which are greatly
relished by several species of birds.

Mockingbirds often remain in our
vicinity throughout the winter due to
their fondness for those privet berries
after frost strikes them.

There is no sign hung to designate our
yard as “Bird Haven,” but I like to think
of it as such. Which reminds me of a
remark that a guest once made as she
surveyed our yard. “It’s a veritable bird
sanctuary,” she declared.

My motive for providing shelter and
food for birds is two-fold. I like them
and think their songs are good for the
soul. Also I desire to study them.

I know of no better way to study birds
than to provide feeding stations for them
and feed them regularly both summer and
winter. I ﬁnd it very interesting to feed
them at the same time each day. Espe—
cially is that true in the morning.

During the breeding season our yard
is in fact a haven for birds. I can usually
tell when a cat is lurking about by the
unmistakable sounds of protest. Just a
few claps of my hands is sufficient to
drive a way the intruder; then almost in-
stantly the excited protests from the
birds cease.

Recently I was confronted with a quite
different problem. I saw a boy grasping
a broom dash into the yard. To my
astonishment I found that he was chasing
a small blue jay trying to capture it. I
promptly discouraged such behavior and
the baby blue jay hopped to safety.

I am convinced that our bird friends
understand a great deal more than most
of us think. If one is their friend, the
birds seem to know it.

One Sunday last fall, I had an urge to
go bird hunting with ﬁeld glasses in some
near-by woods. I thought probably I
might make a new acquaintance. But I
was disappointed, the birds were just not
in the woods.

I forgot my disappointment when I re-
turned to our yard and gazed up into a
tree-like clump of privet hedge. A pair
of cardinals were eating privet berries
with considerable zest. I knew several
other varieties relish those berries but
I had never seen cardinals eat them
before.

Our readers are urged to clip from
“Our Dumb Animals” various articles
and request local editors to republish.
Such copies of the magazine so multilated
will be replaced by us upon application,
if so desired.

How Animals Keep Fit

W. J. BANKS

 

MOTHER NATURE TEACHES THE WAY TO FITNESS
A BUCK SEEKS LIME TO NOURISH HIS ANTLERS

worse than study the ways of the ani-
mals. In the wilds there are no doc~
tors or physical culture magazines, but
mother nature teaches the way to ﬁtness.

Cleanliness is one of her cardinal rules.
Some mice and other furred animals
spend nearly half their lives in cleaning
and combing themselves. Many have spe-
cial equipment for the job, such as the
comb-like split nail of the beaver’s second
hind toe, or the six lower front teeth of
the lemur.

Baths in clear water, mud or dust are
popular with most animals. Many birds
enjoy a dip but usually content them-
selves with a dust bath as drenched
feathers impede flight dangerously. Not
only the tiny sparrow, but the huge ele-
phant dusts himself, blowing earth pow-
dered by his shuffling feet over his back.
The American bison, too, likes nothing
better than a good hole to wallow in.

Animals have clever schemes to rid
themselves of vermin and may help each
other. The crocodile bird devours the
host of tiny lodgers that infest the big
“croc’s” mouth. A skunk was observed
backing slowly into the water until a
crop of lice had transferred themselves
to a mouthful of dried grass which he
carried. Then he ducked suddenly and
swam away.

Diet, we are told, holds the key to
health. Only man is foolish enough
habitually to eat in a manner likely to
produce ill—health. The animal folk never
heard of vitamins but few of us approach
their good sense in eating.

Nature has arranged that the Wild

][F we would keep healthy we could do

folks’ ordinary needs can be satisﬁed near
at hand. But on special occasions extra
groceries may be required, and the ani-
mals know enough to seek them. Thus
cattle or deer periodically visit the salt
lick. A buck seeks water containing
lime to nourish his new antlers. The
spring’s ﬁrst green grass, rich in vita-
mins, is sought eagerly by wild and
domestic animals. The moose, lean from
the hard winter, go after the lily roots
and other water plants.

Your dog may not know what the
spring sunshine can do for him in tech-
nical terms, but he is eager to get out
into it. When pussy licks her fur after
a good sun bath, she may be transferring
some of the essential Vitamins, which she
cannot absorb through the skin.

In spite of every provision of nature
and their own wisdom, animals some-
times fall ill; then remarkable cures may
be effected by self-treatment. A large
zoo found that it was best to leave sick
animals alone with a selection of herbs
and vegetable foods common to its native
land. The patient would select from the
heap the medicines required for the cure.
Probably it would not have fallen ill had
these been available before.

Animals know that different ailments
require different treatment. If feverish
they resort to cool spots, remain quiet,
eat little and drink a lot. Rheumatic
joints are exposed to the warm sun or
healing springs and sulphur baths. In
their own saliva the animals possess a
ﬁne antiseptic dressing which often heals
terrible wounds. Ants will amputate the
broken limb of one of their number.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

New York Editor Fond of Cats

JAMES M. ROSS

Y favorite animals are cats,” said

Miss Daisy Bacon, young, blonde,

brilliant editor-in-chief of three
national magazines, when interviewed at
her ofﬁce in the Street and Smith build-
ing, 79 Seventh Avenue, New York,
where each week she reads more than a
million words in selecting stories for
“Love Story Magazine,” “Range Ro-
mances” and “Detective Story Maga—
zine.” Across the top of her high desk
is a line of over 200 modeled ﬁgures of
cats, with an elephant here and there.
On the walls are many artists’ drawings
in which a cat appears. In her Fifth
Avenue apartment, awaiting her return
from work each evening, are three real
cats—two common ones and a majestic
Persian.

Miss Bacon will not permit poison to
be put out for mice anywhere in her
locality. “If they must die, I do not
want to be around where they have to
suffer. After all, their lives are precious
to them. I do not like to think of a
mouse family being broken up by a
‘murder’ any more than I want kittens
to be outcasts.”

Miss Bacon was commended by the
Humane Society for trying to save a
black cat from being killed by a hit—and-
run automobile driver in New York City.
She saw the cat run down, the car
driver speed off. She hurried the injured
feline to a veterinarian, but it died. Miss
Bacon yet hopes to ﬁnd that malefactor.

When she lived on her grandfather’s
farm she was on friendly terms with 38
cats. She has narrowly escaped eviction
from various apartments because she
wouldn’t give up her pets. When she is in
Arizona on vacation, she says, “there are
always plenty of cats and dogs where I
,go. They walk with me when I walk, and
they sit on my porch when I’m in my
cabin. If my friends want to know where
I am, they look to see where the cats
and dogs seem to be holding a conven-
tion.”

“There is no possible excuse for any
person being unkind to animals,” she
declared. “We cannot remain indifferent
While animals are mistreated. We accept
Without question the protection of help-
less children. Animals are in a some-
what similar category. They are depend-
ent on people for food, kindness, decent
care. They respond much as children do
to tenderness and consideration. Look at
the reaction of any dog or cat or horse.

“We human beings are physically
larger and stronger than most animals
which come our way today. It is usually
the'weaker specimens that are kicked or
otherwise maltreated. Few cats and dogs
can ﬁght back when beaten or abused.
We hear of few brutal attacks being made

 

upon animals able to defend themselves.
Bulls and other cattle will use their
horns if hurt; horses not cowed by ill
usage will bite, kick or charge down the
offender. And who dares approach the
business end of a mule without making
every effort to preserve amity?”

Miss Bacon, tall, slender, with a coun-
try—wide reputation as being one of the
nation’s most perfectly groomed women,
is thoroughly feminine but likes to spend
her vacations on Western ranches where
she may ride horses—she has even rid-
den a bucking broncho in Arizona—and
may study all the animals possible. (She
generally walks, though, “because I think
some of the trails are too hard on the
horses”) In such surroundings, even
her closest friends would ﬁnd it difficult
to recognize, in her riding togs, the cool,
resourceful editor who has built a num-
ber of magazines to national prominence
by her own unaided efforts, and at the
same time retained her traits of humor
and good sense.

Cats and clothes are her hobbies and
she has made a wide reputation by her
taste in both.

A dog is entitled to the ﬁrst bite (ex-
cept in New Jersey and California). He
acquires the reputation of being vicious
only with the second bite.

Lonely on the Hills

G. Cardinal Le Gros
When the hunter walks the hills

I am one with all he kills.

When the wooclcocks, bright and small,
In a burst of feathers tall

Down to earth without a cry,
On the snow with them I lie.

When the timid cottontail
Gazes—cornered on the trail—

Helplessly to East and West,
My heart beats within his breast.

I am lonely on the hills
When the hunter comes and kills.

Work Horses Not Forgotten

Many work horses were treated
with Christmas dinners on the day be-
fore the holiday. In Boston trucks car-
ried individual bags of oats, chopped
carrots and apples which were distri-
buted in the market section and at rent-
ing stables. Humane ofﬁcers of the Soci-
ety in Pittsﬁeld, Springﬁeld, Worcester,
Attleboro, Wenham and Methuen also
provided special rations in many worthy
cases. Time was when the “Horses’
Christmas” attracted wide notice and
met with many a responsive chord. It
had its origin in Boston twenty—ﬁve
years ago. Each year friends of the
horse look forward to this humane holi-
day observance.

1. Question: My son received a puppy
for Christmas. He is now about three
months old and seems very healthy.
However, after he eats his food he has
quite a severe attack of hiccoughs last-
ing several minutes. What can be done
to relieve this condition?

Answer: This affliction is usually the
result of eating too much, too fast. The
condition may be avoided if the puppy
is fed smaller quantities of food at each
meal, even if he must be fed another
meal each day.

2. Question: Our dog has just had
distemper. He is improving but lately
we notice his right front leg keeps jerk—
ing. Sometimes it is normal but more
often it is in constant motion. The con-
dition is worse after excitement. A
friend told us this was “part of” dis-
temper. Is this true?

Answer: The condition you describe is
called chorea. It is a nervous condition
most commonly occurring in conjunc-
tion with, or following, distemper. Its
exact cause is a pathological change in
some spot in the brain. It may result
from some other disease than distemper.
There is no known deﬁnite cure, but
sometimes it will gradually disappear of
its own accord.

8. Question: We have a cat seven
years old. For the last week he has been
sneezing and his eyes are discharging a
watery ﬂuid. His appetite is fairly good,
although not as usual. It looks like a
cold. What can ‘be done for him?

Answer: Your cat is suffering from
what is called cat distemper. It is a
contagious disease among cats. The con-
dition is not extremely serious, but the
animal should receive treatment as soon
as possible. Until such time that you
can take him to a veterinarian he should
be kept indoors and warm.

4. Question: A friend gave us a pup—
py for Christmas. He very kindly gave
us some information as to its care. He
told us to worm the dog in a month.
What should we use for this purpose?

Answer: The promiscuous worming
of puppies is to be discouraged. The use
of drug store worm remedies is a fre-
quent cause of severe digestive disorders
in puppies. There are several types of
worms that may infest dogs. Each of
these requires a different form of drug
for treatment. All of these drugs are
poison if not given in proper dosages.
Your veterinarian is equipped to exam—
ine your dog and prescribe treatment,
if treatment is necessary. The usual and
most accurate method of diagnosis in-
volves a microscopic examination of the
dog’s stool.

Bands of Mercy in 1941

Illinois led in the organization of new
Bands of Mercy for the year, the total
number from that state being 1,508.
Next came Rhode Island with 982, South
Carolina with 613, Texas with 582, and
Georgia with 548. Due to the retire-
ment of Miss Maryott within the year,
the number in Massachusetts was only
251. From twenty states and the Phil-
ippine Islands came reports totaling
6,426, which bring the number of
Bands formed, since the beginning in
1882, to 262,135.

Films in Considerable Demand

The Society still distributes its two
popular silent humane ﬁlms, “The Bell
of Atri” and “In Behalf of Animals,” as
well as the less-known “Small Peter’s
Chief Adventure” and “Boy Meets Dog.”
The various ﬁlms were shown more than
forty times in widely separated states,
from Massachusetts to California. Sev-
eral prints were sold, one for use in New
Mexico.

New Members for Jack London Club

Through the eﬂ’orts of several ﬁeld
workers 16,789 new members were added
to the Jack London Club, all pledged to
do what they can to prevent cruelty in
trained animal acts. The total member-
ship in the Club is now 814,023.

Be Kind to Animals Week

As in former years Governor Salton-
stall of Massachusetts and several other
governors as well as mayors of cities
and state commissioners of education
issued proclamations for the annual Be
Kind to Animals Wee-k. There was an
unusual amount of press and radio pub-
licity, several of the ofﬁcers of the Society
speaking over radio stations in Boston,
while ﬁeld workers presented many talks
on stations throughout the country. Out-
standing were the annual school poster
contest of the Massachusetts S. P. C. A.,
in which more than 8,390 posters were
received from 545 schools in 176 towns
and cities, for which 2,573 medals and
1,571 subscriptions to Our Dumb Ani-
mals were awarded, and the prize con-
test for the best photographs of domestic
animals conducted by Our Dumb Ani-
mals. Twenty-three cash prizes, amount-
ing to $95, and ten subscriptions to Our
Dumb Animals were awarded, many ex—
cellent pictures having been receive-d.
Humane Sunday in Boston was marked
by a radio broadcast by Dr. Rowley and
Thornton W. Burgess, and an illustrated
lecture by the latter which attracted a
large audience to the Boston Public
Library lecture hall.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Quantities of Literature Issued

How much the War will prevent the
publication of literature by the Society
remains to be seen, but in 1941 we were
able to meet the demands from local So-
cieties and humane workers, as the fol-
lowing summary of our production will
show: 133,200 leaﬂets, 5,500 cards, 4,000
posters, 1,200 calendars, and 14,550 blot-
ters. An eleventh edition (10,000) of
the popular “Teacher’s Helper in Hu—
mane Education,” by Dr. Rowley, was
required. Several of the leaﬂets relating
to the care of dogs and cats were thor—
oughly revised by the veterinary depart-
ment of the Angel] Animal Hospital. A
new play for children, “A Place for
Pets,” was brought out for Be Kind to
Animals Week. Nearly 20,000 copies of
an entirely new pamphlet, “Humane
Exercises for the Use of Teachers,” was
issued for circulation in schools of
Massachusetts and Chicago.

The New “Our Dumb Animals”

After its 74 years of regular monthly
appearance, Our Dumb Animals came out
in entirely new form in January. Four
pages of heavy paper, with a colored
cover, were added, which makes the pub-
lication much more attractive and dis-
tinctive. The front—page color was
changed each month, and, in addition, a
larger and clearer type was used for the
text. These improvements in the dress
of a rather conservative and venerable
publication have been received with wide-
spread approval.

Our Humble Helper—the Toad

ROBERT B. PATTISON

HENEVER you see a toad what do

you think of? Repulsive things,
perhaps, like snakes, lizards, giants with
horrid faces, or something that wears a
strange skin and has awkward arms and
legs.

Or perhaps you think of funny things
when you see a toad. It certainly looks
funny enough, squatty and speckled,
something like a plump clown in a circus.

 

THE GARDEN PROTECTOR

Whether ugly or funny, it is lucky for
us that the toad is colored like the dirt.
He is protected by his brownish coat,
though you might wish him covered with
a bright one. If he were handsome and
brilliant in colors, he would be seen too
easily by the insects he wants to catch as
his food. “Beauty is only skin—deep”;
ugliness may be also!

It is also lucky for you that his hands
are so pudgy, though you might wish his
four ugly—looking ﬁngers were more
beautiful. But he needs those thickish
hands to steady him whenever he tries to
hit his target. His target is always some
bug or ﬂy, and the arrow he shoots with
is his tongue.

We forget all about his ugliness when
we learn how useful the toad really is.
His work is to catch and devour thou-
sands of garden insects. And thousands
of them every month. All sorts of them,
beetles and crickets, weevils and grass-
hoppers, yellow jackets and ants, moths
and snails, bugs and caterpillars.

Insects eat fruit and vegetables by the
ton every year; but insects are food for
the toad. If there were too many insects
there would soon be too little food left;
you would be starving while beetles and
caterpillars were getting fat on leaves
of lettuce and apple blossoms and potato
vines. So unless the toads ate the insects,
boys and girls and their parents also
would not have so many ﬁne pears and
juicy peas and good potatoes for their
dining table.

One toad can devour seven house-ﬂies
in a minute. One toad can eat up ten

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

mosquitoes in sixty seconds. Small bugs
disappear very rapidly when the toad
gets busy in the garden. His tongue
ﬂashes out and gets an insect so quickly
that you can hardly see it swiftly go out
and swiftly go back in again, each time
with a beetle or ant on its sticky surface.

Perhaps you have never seen the toad
working so hard. That is because it eats
most While you are sleeping, and may be
hidden all day in a hole it has kicked out
under your cabbage leaves or beneath
your garden steps. But you can watch
it under the electric light in the street,
and see how quickly it jumps whenever
a moth drops down, burned by the light
above, or injured by striking the globe
up there. Nor does it need to move very
much for the food the light sends down
by the air—chute. No wonder the toad is
fat and well-fed.

It has been reckoned that every toad
is worth thirty dollars a year to a farmer
or a gardener. They are like the birds
that protect us safely from our insect
enemies and provide us great quantities
of wholesome food day after day.

A foolish or cruel boy might kill a
toad. A wise one would save it and be
thankful for its usefulness, even if it
looks so ugly. You may have heard about
a famous English warrior named The
Duke of Wellington, the very general
who conquered Napoleon the greatest
ﬁghter of France, when he won the battle
of Waterloo. The great Duke had a toad
in his garden and he had watched it eat
insects so that he knew it was a valuable
little friend of his; so much so that before
the Duke died he left a special wish that
the toad be cared for and allowed to stay
in the garden with the fruit trees and
vegetables it saved for the house table.
Never harm the toad. He is homely and
humble but helpful and created for our
protection. '

An Old, Old Kindness Story

NORMAN C. SCHLICHTER

NE of the most beautiful stories of
kindness to animals is found in the
thirty—third chapter of Genesis.

The brother enemies, Jacob and Esau,
had become reconciled, and Jacob had re-
ceived permission to pass through Esau’s
country, Edom, with his family and ser-
vants, his ﬂocks and herds to a new
dwelling place.

Esau courteously proposed to Jacob
that they two go forward together.
Esau’s servants would then drive the
ﬂocks after them, but Jacob was very
anxious about the little children of the
company and about his ﬂocks and herds.
He told Esau that the children were
tender, and that many of his animals
were with young. He asked Esau to go
alone, and to let him lead the caravan
himself. “I will lead on softly, accord-
ing as the cattle that goeth before me
and the children be able to endure, until
I come unto my Lord unto Seir,” was the
way Jacob put the matter.

Esau gladly fell in with this plan and
went ahead to Seir where the brothers
parted upon Jacob’s arrival. Jacob then
“led on softly” to Succoth, his new home,
at the pace that the children and the
ﬂocks had set.

This story of this ancient farmer,
Jacob, of immortal fame, calls to mind
one part of a prayer for farmers to say
today, written not so long ago by an
Englishman: “Make us good neighbors
one of another. Stir up in us a kindly
management and understanding of all
beasts and birds, domestic and wild,

among whom we work, remembering that
by Thy hand we and they and the whole
earth were and are created.”

Into a Million Negro Homes

ROM reports of one of our represen-

tatives in the South, we feel it is safe
to say that the publicity received by the
American Humane Education Society
during BE KIND TO ANIMALS WEEK
went into more than a million Negro
homes through the Negro press. In addi-
tion it was mentioned on the radio pro—
gram, “Wings Over Jordan,” and the
“Southernairs” and the “Deep River
Boys,” who referred to the celebration,
saying it was sponsored by the Ameri-
can Humane Education Society, Boston,
Massachusetts, through Seymour Carroll
of South Carolina.

How Long Do Birds Live?

The Massachusetts Audubon Society
recently published some interesting ma—
terial in connection with the life span
of birds. Migrating birds are, of course,
subjected to more hazards than those
that remain in one place, although some
of the former have attained long life.
A white pelican, banded in Yellowstone
Park in 1932, died in Montana in 1940,
but a gannet, handed in Quebec in 1922,
lived until 1939.

In British Columbia, naturalists
banded a glaucous—winged gull in 1925.
It was found dead in the same Province
in 1936. The Arctic tern, which covers
more miles in migration than any other
bird, was recorded as having a ten—year
life span; and the much-maligned crow,
hunted, dynamited as it constantly is,
was found in one case to have lived for
fourteen years. But the one for the
record book is the partially-albino crow
which was found dead at Arnold Arbo-
retum, Boston, last year after a recorded
existence of forty years.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Vacation Time

URING the next few months, mil-
lions of Americans will go away
for a vacation. Whether they prefer the
coolness of the mountains or the fresh—
ness of the sea matters little—away they
go each year in search of relaxation and,
in some few cases, a real rest. But with
them, as a real member of the family,
will go the family pet; that is, with the
exception of the ones who thoughtlessly
leave their pets behind to care for them-
selves as best they can.

Each year at this time we receive com-
plaints about such abandonments, and
some of the cases are most pathetic,
often requiring drastic action by our
prosecuting officers.

If, for some reason, you are unable to
take your pet along for the vacation, you
should make proper arrangement for its
care during your absence and, should
you become attached to a dog or a cat
While in the mountains or at the sea—
shore, be sure you take it back to the
city with you when you leave, or arrange
with the nearest humane organization or
veterinarian for the humane disposal
of it.

For the information of the many thou-
sands who each year vacation at Cape
Cod, we call attention to our Shelter at
Hyannis, State Road, Route 28, Center-
ville. Our agent in charge will welcome
your visit.

War and Charity

For a hundred years previous to the
ﬁrst World War, voluntary gifts for
church and related philanthropies aver—
aged approximately the same, in amount,
as our total national expenditures for
army, navy and military defense. They
were also equal to the Federal budget,
exclusive of military items.

Now, in 1942, we ﬁnd government and
war expenses amounting to some thirty
billions, and ﬁfty-eight billions esti-
mated for 1943, while gifts for church
and charitable organizations show an
almost unappreciable increase.

All this simply implies the need for
careful management of all charitable
funds in the years just ahead. We doubt
if we shall ever again see voluntary gifts
equal to the Federal budget.

Animaldom reports in its April issue
that in one (district of the Pennsylvania
Department of Highways, employees re-
moved nearly 12,000 dead animals and
birds from roads last year. Rabbits led
the list, with 8,728 casualties; skunks
came next, with 1,748. Such useless
destruction of animal and bird life could
be reduced to a minimum by proper
driving and strict attention to the road.
There is no excuse for the criminal dis-
regard of wildlife as such driving shows.

J nne, 1942

Songbirds and Air Riﬂes

OUR Hospital ofﬁce in Springﬁeld re-
cently received a letter calling at—
tention to the cruel and useless destruc-
tion of birds in the public parks. The
offenders were boys using air riﬂes, and
the toll of bird life heavy.

Prosecuting Ofﬁcer Fred F. Hall asked
Mrs. Charlena B. Kibbe to publicize the
situation over her weekly radio program,
devoted to the affairs of our Springﬁeld
Hospital. The results obtained justi—
ﬁed all our efforts as, within twenty-four
hours, eleven air riﬂes were conﬁscated
from boys, and the police are on watch
for more.

Splendid newspaper publicity was ob-
tained by Mrs. Kibbe, and an editorial
in the Springﬁeld Union further pointed
out that parents have a moral and, in
some instances, a legal responsibility

when boys with air riﬂes destroy song—
birds.

Let us hope the prompt action by’our
Springﬁeld staff, ably assisted by the
police, the press and the radio, will
serve as a deterrent to this slaughter of
our songbirds. This year, more than
ever before, men will welcome the cheer—
fulness of our birds. Let us protect
them to the best of.- our ability.

Last Call for Photographs

Readers are reminded that the contest
conducted by Our Dumb Animals for the
best photographs of animals or birds will
close on June 30, 1942. After that date
no entries can be accepted. Full par-
ticulars as to the conditions under which
photographs may be submitted and as
to the number and amount of the prizes
($95 in cash), will be sent upon request
to Contest Editor, 180 Longwood Ave-
nue, Boston, Mass.

In Far-Away Australia

Be Kind to Animals Week was ob-
served in New South Wales from April
30 to May 8, with Humane Sunday on
May 3. The Royal S. P. C. A. of Sydney
held an exhibition of animal posters,
made by boys and girls from nine to
nineteen, during the Week. Prizes were
given by Farmer & Company Limited,
and also by the Society. The contest had
the oﬂicial sanction of the Minister for
Education.

If the decreasing amount of gasoline,
and rubber for tires is to mean, as it
seems to, a putting back into service of
the horse, more and more will humane
societies have to guard against his being
overworked or ill-treated. Incomes grow-
ing annually less, taxes doubling, hu-
mane societies apparently are appreciat-
ing their friends and helpers more than
ever.

My Little Scotty Dog
Julia G. Olds

There are men of great achievement
Who have set the world agog,
But I’d rather have the friendship
Of my little Scotty dog,
For his heart is kind and loyal
And his voice rings clear and true
When he barks a friendly welcome,
For he's honest through and through!

He’s a canny little Scotty,
And his eyes look into mine
With a depth of understanding
That seems truly near divine.
If I’m sad he’s quick to sense it
And his soft eyes follow me
With a longing almost human
To express his sympathy;

But if I’m cheerful, happy,
Then his bark is quick and gay
And he keeps the household busy
With his challenge, "Come and play!"
Human friends sometimes deceive me,
And my hopes quite often bog,
But there’s one who never fails me,
That's my little Scotty dog!

A sea lion swallows numbers of stones,
presumably as an aid to digestion. The
young are very playful—tossing pebbles
into the air, enjoying a slippery slide, or
making merry with bunches of seaweed.

PRIZE—WINNING PHOTOGRAPH IN 1941 CONTEST

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

The Author of “Rab”

VINCENT EDWARDS

UST sixty years ago, there died in

Edinburgh, Scotland, the man who
gave literature one of its ﬁnest stories
about dogs. His name —— you’ve probably
guessed it! —-—was Dr. John Brown. His
celebrated tale was “Rab and His
Friends.”

At the time of his death Dr. Brown
was probably the “ﬁrst citizen” of the
Scottish capital. Seldom had a man been
more honored and beloved, and it was
said that people took pleasure just in
seeing this kindly old physician of the
benign face and silver hair walking along
Princes Street on sunny days.

Dr. Brown loved Edinburgh and ap-
peared to know everybody. But his ac-
quaintance extended farther than that of
most people. He knew, not only all sorts
and conditions of men, but most of the
horses and dogs. It was told on good
authority that he respected and sympa-
thized with dog nature just as he did
with human beings. .

One day, as Dr. Brown was driving
along in his carriage, his terrier leaped
from the opposite seat straight through
the open window. The doctor wasn’t the
least bit put out. “I expect he recognized
an ‘old acquaintance,” he said. Another
time he remarked, “I have just met a
deeply conscientious dog. He was carry-
ing his own muzzle.”

It was while Dr.
Brown was studying
medicine as a young
man that the dog
“Rab” wandered into
the Minto House Hos-
pital. It gave the stu-
dent the material for
the story that was to
make him more fa-
mous than his prac-
tice. The tale was writ-
ten “on the quick,” as
he put it. Some years
afterward, his uncle,
a minister, asked him
to give a talk in his
native town. The
nephew wanted to tell
these simple, kindly
Scotch folk a story
they would remember.
So that was how he
came to sit down and
put on paper the mov-
ing account of Ailie
and Rab. He began at
midnight and by four
in the morning the
story was ﬁnished.
But not even Dr.
Brown ever dreamed
that the story would
one day be read and
loved all over the
world!

 

July, 191;?

Police Dogs Aid Mounties
JAMES MONTAGNES

N 86-year-old grandmother started

out to gather some ﬁrewood one
September morning in a sparsely settled
district of Manitoba. She soon left the
ﬁelds behind and lost sight of her farm.
She had gathered ﬁrewood near her farm
for many years, and lately had set out
into the bush where there was plenty of
dead wood on the ground. But this par—
ticular day she traveled a bit farther
than usual. She lost her way, wandered
in the brush till dark, couldn’t ﬁnd her
way out.

On the farm her children began to
worry. They started to hunt for her.
They couldn’t ﬁnd her; took up the trail
in the dark with lighted torches, and
still were unable to locate her. Neighbors
joined in the next day. On the third day
they called in the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, who sent Constable
Bailey and police dog “Sultan” to join
the hunt. The trail was cold, but Sultan
was given some of the old lady’s clothing
to scent. He picked up the trail in the
ﬁelds, headed for the underbrush, and
when last seen was pushing into thicker
underbrush. The Mountie followed as
fast as he could, pushed through the
brush, hacked his way into the thicker
bush, and there found Sultan and the old
lady. She was holding the dog so tightly
around the neck that Sultan had not been
able to bark and announce his success.

That is one of the true tales of how
the police dogs are helping Canada’s
famous Mounted Police force ﬁnd miss-
ing people and track criminals. The
Mounties have 28 of these dogs trained
to follow any trail in the Dominion. They
are mostly shepherd dogs, but there are
also a number of Dobermann pinschers,
Rottweilers and other breeds. Special
Mounties are trained as dog masters to
use the dogs on the trail.

The Circus Again

Spring and the circus, of course, go
hand in hand, and thousands of children
and adults witness performances in all
parts of the country at this time of year.

As a rule, the shows are fairly well
managed in regard to the handling of the
animals. However, each year when the
circus comes to Boston we receive com—
fplaints, especially about rough and un-
necessary beating and poking at the wild
animals.

Our prosecuting oﬂicers investigate
immediately and correct the situations
complained of, but we earnestly hope that
humane organizations, wherever they
may be located, will remain on the alert
for the abuse and torture so often in-
ﬂicted upon the unfortunate creatures
who daily must perform to the tune of
the whip.

The Flag! !

Arthur Macy

Here comes the Flag!

Hail it!

Who dares to drag

Or trail it?

Give it hurrahs—

Three for the stars

Three for the bars.

Uncover your head to it!

The soldiers who tread to it

Shout at the sight of it,

The justice and right of it,

The unsullied white of it—

The blue and the red of it—

And tyranny’s dread of it—

Here comes The Flag!

Cheer it!

Valley and crag

Shall hear it.

Fathers shall bless it—

Children caress it—

All shall maintain it.

No one shall stain it.

Cheers for" the sailors that fought on the
wave for it

Cheers for the soldiers that always were
brave for it

Tears for the men that went down to the
grave for it!

Here comes The Flag!

A Paradise for Birds

VINCENT EDWARDS

HEN United States soldiers return

from Iceland after the war, they
will probably have plenty to tell about
the bird colonies on that island. Nowhere
else in the world can northern birds ﬁnd a
more perfect sanctuary than they enjoy
in Breidi Fjord, that “Broad Bay” as
the name means in English, where there
are so many islands that the Icelanders
claim they can’t be counted.

Anybody who has gone sailing on
these blue waters has discovered how
impossible it is to exhaust the marvels
of bird life in a single outing. In the
nesting season the rocks are overrun with
these Arctic visitors. Here one can see
the pufﬁns, the razorbills, the kittiwakes,

the auks, and long battalions of the
guillemots in their white and black
plumage.

These birds build their nests just as
if they had all signed for locations with
a renting agent. The kittiwakes always
build highest; then, in the rock holes
below them the pufﬁns have their quar—
ters; below the pufﬁns, the guillemots
nest.

There are plenty of other places where
these birds come in great ﬂocks. On
Grimsay in the Hebrides it is not un-
common for the kittiwakes to darken the
sun, and the great bird city north of
Sylt off the Danish coast is one of the

OUR

DUMB

 

A POPULAR FAVORITE

 

wonders of the world. But neither at
Grimsay nor at Sylt is there such various
bird life as on these islands in Breidi
Fjord.

It is a veritable paradise for the orni-
thologist. Here he will ﬁnd the great
burgomaster gulls and the 'skuas—true
overlords and pirates of the air. He will
note the gannets ﬂying in long strings,
and as he gazes, their tiresome “Clak!
Clak! Clak!” will probably be joined with
the “Get away! Get away!” of the kitti-
wakes and the mournful calls of the
oyster catcher. N 0 other sounds will rise
above the lonely noise of the wind and
the sea. Only in far-off Iceland are such
things possible.

Pets and Young Children

JOHN P. DINNENY

I HAVE never been in favor of giving ‘

animal pets to very young children
because of the unhappy possibilities
which are usually realized. Yet, though
still inclined to the same belief, I would
like to relate a little experience in our
own home which brought us squarely
face to face with the issue.

Three months ago an indulgent Aunt
and Uncle unexpectedly presented our
fourteen-months-old boy with a little
puppy. He was just plain dog, a lovable
little thing that snuggled right into our
grown-up hearts at ﬁrst sight. Yet my
wife and I were inclined to reject the
gift, feeling that Paddy was much too
young to appreciate having his own dog.
At the same time we didn’t wish to offend
Paul and Marie whose gift was inspired
by the kindest and most generous mo-
tives. In one of those whispering family
conclaves Ann and I ﬁnally decided to
keep the little stranger for a trial to see
what would happen.

During the ﬁrst week our worst fears
were realized. At every opportunity
nothing seemed to delight Paddy more

 

ANIMALS

Oct. 1942

than to yank “Spot’s” ears, squeeze his
nose, gouge at his eyes, pull his tail, or
even attempt to ride him horseback style.
Spot in self-defense or playfulness was
all over the baby, knocking him down,
licking his face, pawing his arms and
legs with his unblunted claws, or biting
playfully with his sharp little teeth. We
kept them apart as much as possible, but
when they did get together they were
sure to end up crying or yelping.

At the same time we began carrying
out what we considered hopefully an
educational campaign. By talk, action,
expression, grimaces we tried to put over
the idea of what they shouldn’t do to
each other. There was no set formula
except that we brought them together
twice a day when we could watch them
closely and attempt to “educate” them.
It was certainly trying on our patience,
and there were any number of times when
we considered parting with Spot as the
easiest way out. But one look into those
big, seemingly understanding eyes of his
saved him for us on every such occasion.

It took about six weeks before we
could notice any appreciable change in
their attitude toward each other. There
was less of the slam bang head—on action
when they got together. They could meet
fairly peacefully and go about their busi-
ness, even to the extent of ignoring one
another. They were by no means the
understanding companions that we
wished them to be, but this progress gave
us heart. You see, Ann and I wanted the
dog for ourselves too.

Six weeks more have passed, and by
now Paddy and Spot are passably well
adjusted to each other. Our job isn’t
ﬁnished yet, but we feel it is well enough
on the way to a completion which will
auger encouragingly for a friendly com—
panionable relationship between our boy
and our dog for many years to come, God
permitting.

As I’ve already mentioned, I’m still
inclined to the belief that young children
should not be given pets. But if other
parents ever ﬁnd themselves in circum—
stances similar to those which gave us
Spot, they will be called upon to exercise
an unremitting patience worthy of a Job,
if they expect to bring about a happy
adjustment between their child and his
pet. And should the parents have no
interest of their own in pets, perhaps
possessing only an idea or belief that
every child should have one, they would
do well to wait until the child is old
enough to select, train and care for the
pet of his choice on his own responsibility.

to withdraw from any place of public
amusement when performing animals are

They Cry in the Night

CONRAD O. PETERSON

THE day had been one in which strong
north winds peppered the outdoors
with bits of driven snow. With the dark-
ness of evening the wind increased its
velocity until its blasts shook the house.
I rushed outdoors to make sure that the
garage doors were securely fastened.

Suddenly, I stopped, and listened! Up
above in the roaring darkness I heard an
eerie cry! “Geese!” I exclaimed, “Wild
Geese!”

I knew what had happened. The wild
geese, in their southward ﬂight, had been
frustrated in their attempt to land be-
fore the approach of the wild windy
evening. Man, was the answer! Man,
with his gun!

Wild geese ﬂy by instinct. This instinct
tells them of approaching bad weather,
and when this happens while on their
southward ﬂight they at once look for a
place to land. Usually an open ﬁeld or
small lake.

But sometimes a hunter appears. The
blast of his gun frightens the geese and
they then must travel onward, against
their better judgment. They should
land for safety, but dare not. Often too,
the hunter will ﬁre into the air in an
effort to kill and by so doing will break up
their formation.

This V shaped formation serves them
well when darkness approaches, because
they can follow their leader with a great
degree of safety. The leader at the point
of the V is usually an experienced traveler
and is one who has shown his ability to
lead.

It is when this formation is broken

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

”SNOWY OWLM

and the geese become scattered, that
their trouble commences. They do not
know where to land and as the weather
becomes more severe, many must perish.

Wild geese left to their own devices
can. well protect themselves. Nature has
endowed them with the ability and in-
stinct to combat the elements and to
forage for themselves. But they live in
terror of man and his gun.

 

A PROUD BIDDY AND HER BROOD

 

Nov. 1942

Pioneers in Kindness
MARY AGNES COLVILLE

T is gratifying to know that two
hundred years ago, long before the

formal organization of any humane move—
ment, there were outstanding individual
cases of genuine interest in the welfare
of animals.

In England in the year 1722, John,
Duke of Montague, a son-in-law of John
Churchill, the famous Duke of Marl-
borough, had a hospital equipped for the
care of aged horses and cows. None of
the Duke of Montague’s servants dared
to take it upon themselves to kill a
broken-winded horse who could no longer
be used as a mount. Instead the servant
knew well that he was expected to bring
the animal at once to the Duke’s hos—
pital—where it could rest indeﬁnitely,
and receive the best of care to the end
of its days.

Cows also who had grown old in the
faithful service of the Duke’s family
were treated with equal consideration,
and given all necessary hospitalization
and care.

The Duke was also very fond of an
ugly appearing old lap-dog, always pre—
ferring its society to that of other pets.
He lavished much affection on the homely
and aged canine.

The benevolent Duke was quoted by
his friends as saying that he preferred
the old or ugly pets, because no one else
would be likely to be kind to them. The
Duke reasoned wisely that these were in
need of a good friend far more than the
alert, attractive animals on the large
estate.

Certainly, the animals which he owned
were very fortunate to have such a
thoughtful master and champion in an
era when there was little general in—
terest in animals, and much heedlessness,
as well as extreme cruelty practised
toward them by many people.

The Duke of Montague was a pioneer
in kindness toward dependent dumb
creatures. But his benevolence, fortu-
nately, did not prove an isolated case,
though his unique idea of an animal hos-
pital privately maintained for the com-
fort of his own horses and cows, was a
singular undertaking. There were, how-
ever, among the more thinking persons
in different walks of life, in that and
other countries, other pioneers in kind-
ness, even at that date. These, possessing
similar feelings to those of the Duke,
held themselves personally responsible
for at least treating kindly those animals
for which they were directly accountable.
They planted a seed that later germinated
into a more wide-spread beneﬁcence
toward animals throughout the world.

The lack of humane education is the
principal cause of cruelty and crime.

Jessie Merle Franklin

Sometimes when I go walking nights
Along a dark, still lane,

I’m sure I want a dog with size
And prestige, like a Dane.

And then I hear somebody boast
Of his dog’s pedigree

And so I think with changing mind,
”A dachshund it will be."

And still I see another proud
As he shows off his pet,

A keen and eager setter, and
I think, “That’s what I’ll get.”

From collie, chow, to Boston bull

l Hit just like a bee,

And end up keeping some stray pup
Who comes to live with me!

A Seeing-Eye Spaniel
IRMA HEGEL

THE German shepherd dog who has
been trained to lead a blind man or
woman is a familiar sight in our towns
and cities. But I have seen a spaniel who
elected himself to be a “seeing eye” for
another spaniel, blinded by cataracts, and
who plunged into his duties without any
training save love for his blinded buddy.

The two spaniels are pets owned by
a woman pediatrician in New London,
Connecticut. The Doctor was unaware
of her dog’s growing blindness until one
day she noticed the animal drawing his
paw over one eye, apparently trying to
remove something that was bothering

him. Immediately the Doctor took her,

pet to the best veterinarians in New
London and Hartford. Nothing could be
done for the animal. It seemed a layer

even if an operation was attempted, the
dog would be unable to maintain the
quiet recuperation demanded by a deli-
cate operation ofthis sort.

Saddened, the Doctor took her pet
home and kept him in an enclosure
where she felt the little animal would
not bump into anything or injure him-
self. This upset the other spaniel who
mourned the loss of his playmate and
stood forlornly before the wire impris-
oning his companion. When the Doctor
returned to the house, the spaniel who
could see, wriggled under the wire and
helped his pal get out. Then, carefully
poking the invalid out of dangers, the
seeing spaniel took his blind buddy for
a long Walk and a romp.

The DOctor watched the scene from
her ofﬁce window and wisely she did not
interfere. ‘ ’ ' ' ‘

The walks continued every day, the
blind dog no longer dejected but grow-
ing as healthy and frisky as when he
was a puppy.

Recently the Doctor saw the blind
dog dart after a red ball thrown to his
seeing companion. Calling the invalid to
her, the Doctor examined the spaniel’s
eyes. A patch of skin on the left eye
was actually rolling back, allowing the
dog to distinguish objects through the
small opening.

Do cataracts roll away? Will the dog
regain his sight without surgery? If a
dog can become cured of this type of
cataract, cannot new avenues of experi-
mentation be opened for humans? These
are the questions several doctors in New
London are asking. Who knows? Per-
haps the Seeing-Eye spaniel, through
his loyalty to a blind buddy, has done
a kindness to all mankind.

 

L. E. EUBANKS

ﬁlO sensible person denies that there
- are dangerous animals; also, that

exceptional conditions may make even a

very docile creature dangerous. But
those facts do not justify a person in
regarding everyfour-legged animal as a
menace, ready and anxious at all times
to attack.

Many persons, submitting to and en-
couraging such fears, make themselves
nervous—often foolish. Further, they
sometimes cause unjust condemnation of
a really harmless animal. Recently I
saw just such/an instance.

A blind man, boarding the bus, di-
rected his Seeing-Eye dog to “Find a
seat.” The dog passed the ﬁrst three
seats on each side (each fully occupied) ,
then turned sharply from the aisle to a
seat occupied by a young woman.

Like the rest of us, she had seen the
situation; yet she let out a yell, almost
jumped through the window, and caused
the blind man great embarrassment.
Someone in the rear cried, “Oh, a vicious
dog!” The driver stopped the bus, ex-
citement reigned for several moments;
it seemed that the dog and I were the
only calm ones—I was merely disgusted,
and the dog was trying to get under the
seat, where he had been trained quietly
to lie. I gave my seat, across the aisle,
to the woman and sat with the blind
man until we reached my corner.

That samelkind of excitable, unreason—
ing person gets dogs into court unjustly.
A restless child runs into the neighbor’s
yard, against the neighbor’s request to
stay out; the big dog there knocks the
baby down trying to play with him; then
the child’s father has the neighbor ar-
rested for having a “vicious” dog. Here,
in my home city of Seattle, they fre-
quently let such a dog plead his own
case——he comes to the courtroom and
lets any who will pet him, wags his tail,
and usually proves that he has been
falsely accused.

It is safe to assume that an animal
deliberately placed where it could harm
persons will not do so, if the persons do
their part. The Seeing-Eye dog is an
example; trained to guide his master
even in crowds, is it likely that he will
be a biting dog? “He looks so mean,”
complained the woman on the bus. But
we don’t blame people for the face God
gave them; that woman herself looked
as though she might “bite” on very
slight provocation!

An Associated Press dispatch from
Portland, ' Oregon, states that Jimmie
Snook, ten, wrote a prize-winning essay
about his dog. His teacher asked’him to
read it to the class, but Jimmie couldn’t
make it. The dog was poisoned the night
before. **'

MARTIN FOR REFUGEES FROM THE NAPOLEONIC WAR

 

Mme. von Corbelar in Hungary

UR readers who have contributed

toward this devoted humane worker
in a foreign land will be glad to read the
following endorsement of her work:

A well—known humanitarian Visiting
in Budapest sends us this hearty en-
dorsement of the work of Mme. von
Corbelar. This correspondent says,
“When I traveled through Hungary in
1937 Mme. von Corbelar called several
times at my hotel, and through her and
prominent persons she brought with her
I learned about her various projects in
behalf of farm and household animals—
projects that should have been devel—
oped by the government and its educa-
tional department. She merits in char-
acter and in her endeavors all the sup-
port humanitarians in our country can
give her.”

Poster Contest for 1942

Pupils in public and parochial schools
throughout Massachusetts, including
those in Boston, are already at work
making kindness to animals posters for
the annual contest conducted by the
Massachusetts S. P. C. A. Announce-
ments have gone out directly to all su-
perintendents and supervisors of drawing
in the state. If, however, any teacher in
grades above the third, including junior
and senior high schools, has not re-
ceived notice of the contest, the official
circular will be mailed upon request.

The contest closes positively on March
28, 1942, and no posters will be received
after that date. Through the courtesy
of Jordan Marsh Company, Boston, many
of the best of the prize—winning posters
will be displayed in their store.

A Richard Martin House

THE above picture is one of a great
number of houses built by the fa—
mous Richard Martin who secured the
ﬁrst humane legislation for the protec-
tion of animals more than a century ago
in England.

From 1800 to 1812 there was great
unrest in EurOpe because of the Napo-
leonic war. Multitudes of people ﬂed to
Ireland to seek refuge, and Richard Mar-
tin gave up a great number of these
houses which were on his estate and not
far from the Castle of Ballynahinch
where he lived. Martin also gave employ-
ment to many of these refugees.

The houses were built of rough stone,
well—plastered on the inside and thor-
oughly lime—washed. The chimneys were
made of woven rods of switches, then
plastered with lime and water and, when
properly set, were very good smoke
drafters. The ﬁre was built on the hearth
with a good block of bogdale to serve
sufficient light to the housewife to get
about the kitchen without striking her
Shinbone against a post or timber.

The fowl were mostly kept under the
beds which were built so high that there
would be plenty of room to take care of
them.

New Bound Volume

The new bound volume of Our Dumb
Animals, including the twelve numbers
of 1941, bound in cloth and stamped in
gold, is now ready for delivery. It con-
tains 240 pages and 175 illustrations of
animals and birds. Although there are
48 pages more than in previous years,
the price is the same, one dollar, post-
paid. This is an excellent volume to give
to any friend of animals.

tunate in having a very active and help-
ful Work Committee, made up of en—
thusiastic women, who serve the Animal
Hospital by preparing bandages, fur-
nishings for the operating tables, and
the like. During the year ending April

1. Question: How can I prevent my
cat from getting this cat disease that is
so prevalent among young cats? We
haven’t been able to raise a kitten for
several years. They stop eating, act very
dopey, vomit a lot and then die.

Answer: This very prevalent disease
of young cats is known by several names,
cat typhoid, dysentery, distemper, etc.
These names are inaccurate and the
proper name is panleucopenia. There is
no sure way of obtaining a permanent
immunity from this disease. However,
your veterinarian should be able to give
inoculations of hyperimmune serum to-
your cat. This will Offer protection for
one or two months, and should be re-
peated until the cat is at least a year
and a half of age. This method is not
a hundred per cent perfect, but will offer
reasonable protection.

2. Question: We have a male chow
dog six years old. Would it be advisable
to have him clipped during the summer
months?

Answer: Many people think that clip—
ping an animal in the summer makes it
cooler. This point is debatable. A dog’s
coat acts as an insulation against heat
as well as against cold. Of course, they
do pant and act as though they are un-
comfortable in the heat—this is only
natural, but, on the other hand, removing
their hair is unnatural. Light-skinned
dogs often will suffer from severe burn-
ing if their coats are clipped. Another
point against clipping is that the coat
tends to be much thicker when it grows
again. Think twice before clipping your
dog.

3. Question: Is a four-year—old dog
too old to be spayed?

Answer: A dog of this age is not too
old to be spayed. However, the Opera-
tion involves a little more risk to the
animal. There is more shock resulting
from the operation at this time, and
there is more danger of hemorrhage dur-
ing the operation. Many dogs of this
age have been spayed with no ill effects,
but one should realize that it is a more
serious Operation after an animal has
reached full maturity.

4. Question: Should puppies be fed
milk after they are weaned?

Answer: There is no reason why a
puppy cannot be fed milk. An old be-
lief was that this caused worms, but that
belief is not true. Individuals in some
breeds, such as Boston terriers, cannot
tolerate milk unless mixed with other
foods in small quantities. Milk is a very
good natural food for most animals and
should be part of your puppies’ diet.

His Woodland Friends

GENEVIEVE D. O’NEILL

AVE you ever been a hunter of

beasts? Not the sort who would
slay them for the fun of taking a life,
but the type that goes out into the wilder-
ness to hunt for love and to instil trust
and happiness in the hearts of God’s un-
tamed creatures? Walter S. Schneider
of Pasadena, on his yearly pilgrimages
into the national parks and byways of
the West is one of this type.

All living things are sacred to him;
for in them dwells the spirit of the All-
Father. He can name for you practically
every wild ﬂower in California. He is
never so happy as when he has the privi—
lege of bringing to his home armfuls of
them to place upon display in a public
window or share among the folk who are
sick and shut in and, therefore, unable
to View them in their glory out in the
ﬁelds.

But best of all he loves the wild beasts
that roam the forests and meadows. To
them he turns with a tenderness unusual
in a man who has spent most of his life
in doing practical, everyday things.

Away from the haunts of men, out in
Nature’s realm, he ﬁnds his greatest hap-
piness. “Near Crater Lake,” he wrote
to a friend a While ago,
“I fed two big bears
and ﬁnally coaxed the
mother bear out for an
apple. Such a thrill!”
But bears are clumsy
and cannot see very
well, and they are
stronger than people
realize. They are also
none too sure of our
motives. So, for the
average person, feed—
ing a bear by hand is
risky in the extreme.
Nevertheless many of
them are so well ac-
quainted with Walter
Schneider that he can
feed them fearlessly,
his heart rejoicing in
their trust of him.

And Wild deer come
gladly to eat from his
hand. Even the ground
squirrels, chipmunks
and tree folk look for
a tidbit from him now
and then, instead of a
bullet which the hunter-
killer would give them.

For pleasure and rec—
reation, for work and
business, for health and
that keep-young spirit
most of us have, there’s
nothing to equal a good
riding horse!

OUR DUAIB ANIIVALS
My Friend

JUDY VAN

OMETIMES when people come to

our ranch and see the hens out

scratching in the pastures, the ducks
on the pond, goats, sheep and calves in
the hills, they ask “Don’t the coyotes
bother?” And I reply, “If they did it
would be my fault. If I left chickens
and ducks out all night I would scarcely
blame a hungry coyote for getting some-
thing to eat.”

As for calves and goats and sheep, the
coyotes around here have never bothered
them. A coyote would have to be starv-
ing and very big and strong to harm a
calf when the mother cow was near.

It is my belief that coyotes do far
more good than harm—not that I am of
the school of thought that every animal
has to “do good” to mankind to earn the
right to live. Man himself appears to
be the most destructive and most cruel
animal of all.

Undoubtedly coyotes help bring about
the balance of nature, were it not for
these hardy animals certain sections of
the West would be overpopulated with
small rodents. In one locality coyotes
were known to have ended a plague of

THE COYOTE SEXTET

DER VEER

grasshoppers, for a grasshopper is a
succulent tidbit to a coyote.

I cannot think these animals cruel. A
coyote pouncing on a young rabbit is no
more cruel than a housewife going to
market to buy steak or lamb for dinner.
The character of the coyote is much de-
famed. He is called cowardly because he
wants. to live. Often he is too smart to
step on the spring of a steel trap, to eat
poisoned meat. If he does not want to
face a man with a gun, who can blame
him? If he runs from hounds I think
he is showing good judgment.

Once I saw a coyote being very, very
brave. On a hill trail I came across two
coyotes, one ran and one disappeared in
the brush. The one that ran headed in
a dangerous direction—if it went on up
a slope and down the other side it would
come to a paved highway.

Suddenly I heard barking, almost ex-
actly like a dog’s. I looked and there,
not far from me and standing in plain
sight on a big boulder, was the coyote
who had ﬁrst disappeared into the brush.
Easily I could have shot him, or struck
him with a stone. He stood proudly and
unafraid, wildly beautiful from his
pointed nose to his thick bushy-tail. He
barked and he barked, and looked at me,
and barked some more. He wanted me
to watch him.

But out of the corner of my eye I
caught a movement in the brush. The
other, smaller coyote who had run in an
unwise direction, was coming back. I
thought it must be the mate of the one
who was so bravely covering her retreat.

The big one continued to stand on his
high boulder and look at me, and bark,
and he stood there until she had crept
past him and on to disappear in a rocky
arroyo.

He gave a ﬁnal challenging bark,
leaped from his boulder, and disappeared.

I think it took more courage than the
average human can understand to have
stood unsheltered and attract attention
to himself until his mate had reached a
safe place. In his mind I was a deadly
enemy; he had no way of knowing that
I was friend instead of foe.

Cuddlesome Coyote Pets
G L E N P E R R I N S

When the mother and father of these
six—weeks old coyotes were caught in
traps, Hax Hunter of Hooper, Utah,
adopted them and made nice pets of them,
although they had sharp teeth and claws.
He offered them to friends provided they
would not let them run wild and perhaps
prey on cattle and sheep when they had
attained full growth.

Humane Societies seem to have been
ignored by rationing ofﬁcials in Washing—
ton. Their ambulances and the cars by
which their agents have to travel through
the state, preventing the ill-treatment of
animals, and to stay the hand of cruelty,
seem liable to have to cut their work
seriously for lack of gas.

A colored man, an American citizen,
recently walked into a voting place in
one of our states to cast his ballot.
Stopped by an ofﬁcial, he was told that
“Only white men are allowed to vote
here.” And this is America, “the land
of the free and the home of the brave.”
Yet that man can be sent to the front
line to be shot for the country that denies
him his constitutional right to vote.

A lover of animals, thoroughly sane,
and no extremist, thanking us for what
she learned at our ﬁrst aid classes, re-
cently held here at our Hospital, writes:
“In Our Dumb Animals ——and this may
seem incredible to you ——I ﬁnd more real
religion than almost anywhere else. I
turn to it again and again when my faith
in humanity is slipping, and I ﬁnd help.”
For such a tribute we are sincerely
grateful.

A protest comes to us against taking
pet dogs from good homes and sending
them away for service in the Army and
Navy. We can understand the protest,
but, so far as we know, few such dogs are
being given up. Rather those which, for
some reason or other, their owners are
glad to part with, and for which homes
would have to be found. Only when dogs
are brought to us to be given to any
Army or Navy group do we have any part
in the transaction.

“The Passing of Tyranny”

An extraordinary sermon was preached
some weeks ago by the Rt. Rev. Robert
Nelson Spencer, D.D., Episcopal Bishop
of West Missouri. It dealt primarily with
the question of the supreme patriotism
of our Lord, a patriotism that, wide as
the world, still was intensely loyal to
the land of one’s birth. In this sermon
he says:

“I have seen a little poem, of whose
authorship I know nothing save that it
was written by an English sailor in the
Jutland battle of the ﬁrst world war.
That man was troubled, too, as to whether
the Man who loved the whole world
enough to die for it, could yet love His
own land most of all. And so this sailor
said:

‘I would not mind to die for them,

My own dear downs and comrades true;
But that Great Heart of Bethlehem,

He died for those He never knew.

And yet I think on Golgotha

When Jesus’ eyes were closed in death,
He saw with a most passionate love

The little streets of Nazareth.’ ”

The Dogs at Dunkirk

Remember the escape back to England
of the British Army from Dunkirk?
Eight hundred of those English soldiers
carried with them back across the chan-
nel 800 dogs picked up by them in France,
Belgium and Holland. These homeless
dogs, their owners killed or ﬂeeing from
their homes, had simply been adopted by
these eight hundred Tommies. How can
you account for the rescue of these home-
less dogs? “I can offer no explanation,”
writes the journalist who tells the story,
“than that they were British and even
the horrors of war could not deaden their
love for dogs, especially dogs in distress.”

Do You Know About This?

WELL, if you eat meat or drink milk
you ought to. The following isn’t
pleasant reading if you are one of those
who think we should never mention any-
thing which tells of cruelty. But then
how have laws to prevent cruelty been
secured? How has public opinion been
aroused to the point of its demanding
certain cruelties be stopped? By writing
about these cruelties, by talking about
them, by pleading with people to do
something about it.

Dehorning cattle, do you know what
that means? Do you know that perhaps
the very dairy from which you get your
milk has subjected the cows from which
it is taken to brutal cruelties by sawing
off or cutting off their horns? That the
saw or the heavy steel shears cut down
below the juncture of the horn with the
skin? That from the severed artery the
blood throbs out till either by pressure of
the artery or from natural causes the
artery is closed?

This dehorning cruelty goes on all
over the land, in our dairies, on our
ranches and on our great cattle ranges.
Against this mutilation there is no spe-
ciﬁc law, though in Ireland, we have been
told, it is forbidden as illegal. The
Farmers’ Bulletin No. 1600, U. S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture, gives directions for
it and describes the knives and saws, and
makes no mention of the use of any local
anesthetic, recommended by the highest
veterinarian authorities, which materi-
ally reduces the suffering. Indeed prob-
ably most of the farmers and ranchmen
do the dehorning themselves in the crud-
est manner, without the help of a veter—
inarian.

Why this mutilation called dehorning?
Here is what the Bulletin No. 1600 says:

OUR LHNWB ANIMALS

Veterinary Column

1. Question: Our dog was injured in
a ﬁght, and we took it to a veterinarian.
The ﬁrst thing he did was to clip away a
lot of the dog’s hair. We were quite dis-
turbed by this procedure, but said noth—
ing. It has been about three weeks since
that time and there doesn’t seem to be
any hair growing out. Will the hair
grow again after it is clipped away?

Answer: Hair will always grow back
after it is clipped from a dog. Your vet-
erinarian’s procedure is correct. The
ﬁrst thing to do to a wound is to remove
all debris and clip the hair away from the
wound.

It takes about two or three months for
all the hair to grow back when it has been
clipped.

2. Question: Last summer my cat was
hit by an automobile and recovered after
about a month of lameness. She seemed
hurt in her rear legs. She was supposed
to have kittens last month, but it was
quite evident that it was impossible, so
we had her put to sleep. Was there any
way we could have saved her life, as she
was a Very dear pet?

Answer: The present day veterinarian
is competent to deliver kittens by per-
forming a Caesarean section. There is of
course a risk to any operation involving
the use of a general anesthetic, but the
per cent of accidents of this sort in rela—
tion to success is very low.

Probably your best procedure would
have been to have the cat examined at the
time of the accident to determine the
exact injury. In your cat it was un-
doubtedly a fractured pelvis. When this
occurs in the female cat, spaying is al-
ways advisable.

3. Question: I have recently had my
dog inoculated against distemper. Since
that time he has been shedding his hair
much more than ever before. Is there
anything about these inoculations that
would cause such a thing to happen?

Answer: There is no reason to believe
that a series of distemper inoculations
would cause loss of hair. The most log—
ical explanation would be the fact that
dogs often shed their hair more in the
winter because they are exposed to the
warm, dry air of a heated house.

There are many things that cause an
animal to shed its hair, natural and other—
wise. Your veterinarian could probably
advise you in this matter if you would
explain your case to him.

4. Question: My son received a pres-
ent of a female puppy. She is now about
ﬁve months of age and in excellent health.
Is she too young to be spayed?

Answer: This operation is most satis-
factorily performed when puppies are
about ﬁve or six months old. There is
less shock and surgical risk when they

M ar. 1942

are operate-d upon before their ﬁrst estral
period which usually occurs around seven
months of age.

In Winifred Kirkland’s deep and
searching book, “Are We Immortal?” the
following passage seems worthwhile re-
membering: “Christian faith means, to
me, the daily, hourly attempt to live as
if the most mysterious man in human
history were closer than breath beside
me. The more I study the short records
of his passage across time, the more I
am impressed with the fact that Jesus
of Nazareth lived every moment of his
earthly life as if he expected to live
foreverf’

The Retort Courteous

Writing in the Fitclhburg Sentinel,
Barbara Allen discusses the tact neces-
sary in securing gifts for a good cause.
She especially stresses the need of ap-
propriate acknowledgments of such gifts,
and cites this illustration:

“Since such a line of sincere apprecia-
tion came to me awhile ago from the
president of the S. P. C. A., it will il-
lustrate exactly my point. He wrote
thus:

“ ‘Again you have remembered us with
your much-appreciated gift of ﬁve dollars
and I hasten to thank you for it. You
have been a good friend to us since 1922
and we want to assure you of our sincere
gratitude for your continued interest
and your help.’

“When I received this gracious note
I felt that it would be a real pleasure to
give to the S. P. C. A. whenever I may
be called upon for a contribution. I felt
that the gratitude expressed was out of
all proportion to the smallness of my
check. I am actually looking forward to
the next appeal.”

Proof of Greatness
MARY AGNES COLVILLE

NGLAND’S popular and much loved
Queen Victoria was known far and
wide for her great kindness of heart—
a kindness that did not restrict itself to
people but reached out to animals as well.

An interesting anecdote related in
Queen Victoria’s time concerned the day
of the youthful Queen’s coronation in
Westminster Abbey.

It was, of course, an affair of consider-
able pomp and circumstance. The youth—
ful ruler wore a magniﬁcent crown
studded with diamonds and her train of
crimson velvet and gold was carried by
eight stately young peeresse-s.

Cannons thundered —— trumpets blared
—there was music—prayers—a sermon
——besides the administering of the oath
to the Queen.

It was truly an occasion to awe any
young heart—even that of one born to
rule.

In her beautiful robes of state, the
girlish queen was driven from Westmin-
ster Abbey through the streets after the
ceremonials, amid cries of “God Save
the Queen.” As the impressive cortege
approached the Palace grounds through
streets thronged with her loyal, admir-
ing subjects, the young ruler suddenly
spied one spectator that interested her
more than all the rest. And this spectator
gave her a heart—warming ovation in the

form of a series of ecstatic welcoming
barks.

Forgetful of- her own great position
or the solemnity of the occasion, the
young Queen cried out joyously in
simple, unaffected tones, “Oh, there’s
‘Dash’ ——dear ‘Dash’! ” In her eyes was
a warm welcome for this favorite pet, a
ﬁne spaniel of noble, affectionate mien.

The newly crowned young ruler ap-
peared more thrilled and touched by her
pet’s greeting than by all that had just
taken place. Ceremonials, cloth of gold
and ermine, and robes of state were of
less importance than a dog’s love of his
mistress.

It seems a proof of greatness when
devotion to a pet takes precedence over
absorption in personal glory or triumphs.

What is a Pedigree-Dog?

N our September issue we carried a
story under the above title. We ob-

tained our information from The Ani-
mals’ Friend, of London, England. A
friend of the Society’s and a reader of
Our Dumb Animals wrote to us objecting
to the article, stating it was “unfair to
reputable breeders of pedigreed dogs.”

The following is quoted from our cor-
respondent’s letter:

“I raise pedigreed dogs and I’ll defy
anyone to say that any one of the three
lively, healthy, intelligent little rascals
that I can see from my window are ‘neu-
rotic invalids with brains on a par with
their stamina.’

“I frankly admit that there are breed-
ers who do not use discretion in breeding,
for selﬁsh commercial reasons, but why
measure all breeders by the same yard-
stick? Give the rest of us breeders our
just dues in having a genuine love of the
dog and being wise and careful in our
choice of sires, thus producing pups with
both beauty and brains.”

Make your dog your companion and
friend. Treat him kindly and he will
respond.

A Question of Rights

JACK KYTLE

ELIEVING strongly in the right of

all animals to kindly treatment,
Thomas Erskine, Lord Chancellor of Eng—
land during the early 1800’s, sometimes
lost his temper when this right was vio-
lated. On one occasion, he came upon a
man savagely whipping a pack-horse, and
without hesitation asked that the unwar—
ranted punishment be stopped.

The owner wheeled about to face him,
his face livid with rage.

“It’s my horse,” he said sullenly.
“Mayn’t I use it as I please?”

He turned back toward the heavily—
burdened animal and renewed the beat-
ing. This was too much for the Lord
Chancellor. Lifting his walking cane, he
struck the tormentor several blows
across the back.

Protesting loudly, attempting to escape
the onslaught, the man cried, “You’ve
no right to do this!”

“It’s my own stick,” Erskine replied.
“May I not use it as I please?”

Please remember the Massachusetts
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals when making your will.

The Responsibility
A n n a R . B a k e r

Do larks sing hymns of hate; or crows
Chatter of gun and tank and fleet?
Do wrens contrive a plane that throws
Death from the sky; or flickers beat
Their sharp tattoo as a call to arms?
The red-winged blackbird spreads no fear,
The cardinal sounds no raid alarms,
But signals hopefully, “All Clearl".
Ducks on the lake are not afraid

Of submarines. The robins have sealed
A pact of peace. Then who has made
This world of ours a battlefield?

“Porky” Will Beneﬁt

FERN BERRY

NE of Mother Nature’s children to

beneﬁt from the shortage of tires
will be Mr. Porcupine, for this fearless
fellow is often killed by speeding motor-
ists. He does not fear the automobiles
and takes his own time about getting out
of the road. Since the salty compound
used to lay dust on gravel and melt ice
on the pavements is greatly relished by
the porcupine, he comes to the highways,
often to his death.

In Upper Michigan, the trees in the
early springtime may have a dozen or
more of these bushy, spiny fellows,
climbing about in search of the tender
buds and shoots. They look very large
when seen from a distance and city folks
have often exclaimed, “See, a bear!” But
the highway is not the only death trap
for the porcupine. He ambles about in
the vicinity of villages, summer homes,
lumber camps and city dumps and he
likes to poke his narrow head into tin
cans left open. He will lick the bits of
food from the cans but many times he is
caught fast. You may ﬁnd skeletons of
the porcupine in the Vicinity of the city
dumps, or wherever cans are thrown
away. I have rescued, on several occa-
sions, a “porky” from this form of death
trap and it is a ticklish job. About the
best way is to step hard on the barbed
tail and hold it ﬁrmly or you may be
hurt with the painful spines.

"The night has a thousand eyes,
And the day but one;

Yet the light of the bright world dies
With the dying sun.

“The mind has a thousand eyes,
And the heart but one;

Yet the light of a whole life dies

0ST fatal highway accidents are
M never recorded. The motorist

drives on, usually unaware that
a crushed or mangled little form lies by
the wayside. The tens of thousands of
human fatalities are carefully tabulated
annually. But the loss of life among
animals and birds is difﬁcult even to es-
timate. Doubtless the toll soars far into
the millions.

One motorist, during a trip of some
1,000 miles through several northern
states and a Canadian province, counted
among other victims 14 skunks, 18 house
cats, 2 gray squirrels, 1 muskrat and 17
cottontails, all lying dead on the road.
On a 750—mile Colorado trip, 56 prairie
dogs and 12 ground squirrels were
among the 84 dead mammals noted; also,
7 birds. When driving over the north-
ern prairies at certain times of the year,
you may have noted dead gophers which
must have averaged at least one to the
mile.

Farmers make no effort to spare the
grain-eating rodents.

No observer could hope to see all the
victims in a given stretch of road; many
lie in ditches or wayside growth. And
with the sketchy data available, a reli-
able ﬁgure for the whole country cannot
be given. But the staggering propor-
tion of the unknown total may be imag-
ined, and in the case of a number of
species, highway loss gives conserva-

tionists a real headache.

Not all animal road
fatalities affect the small
fry. Many a motorist has
had to pay a farmer as
well as a garageman af‘
ter striking one of the
larger domestic animals.
Deer and other wild crea—
tures frequently become
panicky and jump out
into the path of a speed—
ing car. Usually they are
killed or have to be de-
stroyed. One motorist
received a bad shaking-
up not long ago when a
huge bull moose charged
the car, breaking his own
neck and partially wreck—
ing the vehicle.

In the national game
reserves, animals become
so tame that they graze
unconcernedly by the
wayside and the motorist
has to be doubly careful.
Rocky‘ Mountain travelers
see mountain sheep and
goats, mule deer, even elk
and moose with varying
frequency. The black
bears in some parks have
developed quite a technique in squatting
on the road to force the driver to stop
and feed them. Occasionally the “high-
way'men” meet with a mishap, but usu-
ally the h-old—up works.

When you are driving a motor car or
other vehicle, watch out for furred and
feathered wayfarers. No one will sug-
gest that you endanger human life by
swerving or otherwise avoiding an ani—
mal. But ordinary care can save many
wild folk and domestic creatures. Exces—
sive speed is the greatest highway enemy
of the animals, as well as of human
safety and. economy.

Plays in Tacoma Schools

Through the efforts of Mrs. Florida
L. Byrne, representing the American
Humane Education Society in Tacoma,
Washington, copies of the short plays
published by the Society have been
placed in many of the schools of that
city. In this, as well as in other hu-
mane educational activities, Mrs. Byrne
has had the cordial support of the super-
intendent of schools and of the school
principals. She has reached the state
secretary of the Washington Congress
and the local Parent—Teacher council and
the director of the Girl Scouts, as well as
the president of the Council of Churches,
with humane literature in which they
have expressed much interest.

Ask Worker to Return

UPILS in one of the colored schools
which he had visited in Virginia
wanted to take up a collection to have the
Rev. John W. Lemon, ﬁeld worker of the
American Humane Education Society,
return to them and tell them more about
our dumb friends. They sent him letters
telling how much they enjoyed having
him with them and what they were aim—
ing to do in helping in the great work of
kindness to every living creature. He
was glad to let them know that he would
come back without the children’s taking
a collection to pay his way. He found
the teacher, with whom he had been work-
ing for some time, greatly interested in
the cause.
Mr. Lemon visited Hampton Institute,
Virginia, early in June, where he held a
humane exhibit throughout the week.

Large Junior Membership

Miss Juliette D. Jaccard, president of
the Hudson County District S. P. C. A.,
Jersey City, N. J., has developed the
humane education program of that So-
ciety until the junior department now
numbers 23,000 members. She receives
the full co-operation of the school oﬂ‘icials
throughout the county, and during the
recent Be Kind to Animals Week cele-
bration was able to distribute quantities
of the 1942 Defense posters in schools,
libraries and other public organizations.

Under the direction of the Scottish So-
ciety for Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals a school essay contest was held in
1941, when 18,279 essays were received
from pupils in 387 schools, on the sub-
ject, “How Wild Birds Help the Farmer.”
More than 500 prizes, consisting of books
about animals, were awarded.

To a Canary Bird
Benjamin Drew—1892

Can e’er a bird more friendly be

Than thou that sittest on my tree,

And singst thy happy song to me,
Canary?

Can e'er a mortal understand

The language of thy native land?

It so, come, perch upon my hand,

And put thy tongue at my command—
Canary.

The Frog’s Peculiar Tongue

Perhaps the most peculiar tongue in
all animaldom is that of the frog. Fas-
tened in the front portion of the mouth,
it is ﬂung forward to catch the prey
which adheres to its sticky surface long
enough for the frog to deliver it back
into his mouth. And if the catch proves
too big to swallow easily, the frog pushes
it down with his front feet, gives a con-
vulsive shudder of his whole frame, at
the same time pulling in his eyes. Frogs,
and toads, too, are valuable to have
around the place.

For School Compositions

Cash prizes totaling $15, contributed
by Mrs. Ralph Sweetland, were awarded
near the end of the school year to pupils
in Junior high and grade schools of
Natick, Massachusetts, for the best
compositions on the subject, “Be Kind to
Animals.” We wish that some generous-
minded person in each community would
offer similar prizes, as there is no better
form of humane education than this
which was advocated and practised so
enthusiastically by the late George T.
Angell, founder of the Band of Mercy.

“Horned feeder cattle require more
space at the feed trough. Dehorned
slaughter cattle almost invariably pro-
duce carcasses with fewer and less seri—
ous bruises than similar horned cattle
handled under the same conditions.
Carcass values are materially lowered by
bruises, and hides are frequently dam-
aged by horns.”

The dairyman’s reason is that the
cows with their horns often ﬁght with
one another and cause more or less in-
juries. This we admit is true. But the
whole wretched business of dehorning
could be stopped if cattle owners would
take the trouble to be a little humane
instead of thinking ﬁrst and above all
of proﬁt. In the early days of the calf,
within say two weeks from birth, the
growth of the horn is stopped by a
simple and inexpensive treatment.
Moisten the little spot or button under
the skin, where the horn shows signs of
starting, then rub, not breaking the skin,
with a small stick or pencil of caustic
soda or potash till a little redness appears,
and no horn will develop. One treatment
generally is sufﬁcient. We know this,
because we have tried it many times.

Recently, right here in a New England
state'a great dairy company dehorned
142 cattle in four hours, using no local
anesthetic. The case was brought into
court by the humane society of the state
and the Judge dismissed it without a
conviction.

Do Not Miss This

THE following paragraphs are taken

from an article that appeared recently
in the Boston Traveler, by George R.
Farnum, Boston lawyer and former As-
sistant Attorney General of the United
States. We greatly regret that our space
allows us only to reproduce a part of
one of the most timely and striking
articles that have appeared during this
unspeakable war.

Near Fort Devens stands a small
marker on which are inscribed the words,
“Yankee Lady, just a damn ﬁne dog.”
Under it sleeps a little mongrel dog who
gave her life in a gallant effort to save
that of her soldier buddy. With that in-
scrutable instinct that distinguishes her
kind, she had attached herself to him
when his unit had encamped nearby, and
followed him by day and guarded him by
night. Then came the day when her
master went in swimming and she sat
anxiously watching from the bank.
Died Attempting Rescue

A sudden cry of distress apprised her
that he was in danger. Instantly she went
to the rescue. The soldier was saved, but
when the excitement had subsided Yankee
Girl was missing. Her poor, lifeless body
ﬂoated ashore a day later. Sadly they
buried her near the scene of her exploit,
wrapped in an army fatigue jacket and

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

with all honors, as beﬁtted a faithful pal
of a soldier, and wrote the little epitaph
on her grave to commemorate her last
brave act of devotion. . . .

Humane Sentiments

Sustained and sympathetic interest in
the welfare of those dumb and humble
friends who share the perils and priva-
tions as well as the comforts of our daily
lives, and give so much and ask so little
in return, argues that in spite of all the
destructive inﬂuences of the times most
people are still spiritually sound at the
core, regardless of the deplorable aspects
of many of their actions. . One of
Galsworthy’s characters put it more ap-
pealingly. “I have observed,” he said,
“that before men can be gentle and broad-
minded with each other, they are always
gentle and broad-minded about beasts.
These dumb things, so beautiful—even
the plain ones — in their different ways,
and so touching in their dumbness, do
draw us to magnanimity and help the
wings of our hearts to grow.”

And so when I read in the press the
extent of the public interest in the stories
of Yankee Lady and of Laddie—and in
many another animal epic as well — I re—
joice that notwithstanding all the en-
grossing distractions, bitter harrass-
ments, and terriﬁc turmoil of these cruel
and fateful days, there are persuasive
indications that most people are not los-
ing their gentleness and innate kindness,
that they are still '
responsive to the
tremulous ap—
proaches of the
pathos and tender-
ness of the little in-
cidents and dramas
of common daily life.
These qualities will
all be needed when
the day comes to
begin the recon-
struction of a new
and better world~a
world from which
cruelty must be
banished and in—
humanityproscribed.

Endowed stalls and
kennels are needed
in the Angel] Memo-
rial Animal Hospital.
Payments of thirty-
ﬁve dollars for a ken-
nel or seventy-ﬁve

THREE SWANS ALL WHITE AS SNOW

’Tis Nature’s Way
Salvatore Marsiglia

Topsy killed a bird today,

And I am grieving sore!

For though ’tis only nature's way
I do not feel, and this I say,
That I could love her any more.

The strong may prey upon the weak;
That, too, is nature's way!

But this grim knowledge do I seek:
Why do the former wish to wreak
Death and destruction just for play?

She lay the bird beside my chair
And looked expectantly;

And I could feel the sparrow's stare
And sorrow creeping, quite aware
Of what this base deed meant to me.

Black cat, I cherished with a pride,
What motive prompted you

To kill the sparrow at my side

When through your kitten days I tried
To teach good things to you?

A tiny heart— a life snuffed out—
A voice ne’er to be heard.

A nest that now must be without
A mother fluttering about

A hungry, wayward sparrow-bird.

Topsy killed a bird today,

And I am grieving sore!

’Tis nature’s way! ’Tis nature’s way!
But this I feel, and this I say:

I still should love her as before.

Christmas Toys

HE pen is mightier than the sword.”

Familiar words, these. Are they too
familiar? Has “familiarity bred con-
tempt?” Today’s world conditions would
seem to give them the lie. But we are
too close to today’s world conditions to
View them in the proper perspective.

What has this hackneyed phrase to do
with “Christmas Toys?” Simply this: It
may be interpreted as contrasting the
forces of construction with those of
destruction, with the forces of destruc-
tion coming out a poor second. This is
as it should be. This in the long run
is the way it is.

In the life of a child, these forces are
constantly at work. It is the sacred duty
of parents to bend every effort toward
elevating the one and suxbmerging the
other. If there is a time of the year when
parents should concentrate on the fulﬁll-
ment of this duty, it is at Christmas.

Who cannot look back over the years
and remember with remarkable clarity
a favorite toy of childhood? But there
must be many who cannot look back
without a pang of genuine remorse or
horror, because a gun or other weapon
meant, inconsistently, as a gift to bring
joy, brought instead sightlessness, mar-
ring scars or even death to a brother,
sister or childhood playmate.

Dear old Saint Nick has collaborated
with the toymakers in the U. S. A. to
manufacture some of the ﬁnest, most
inspirational and constructive toys ever
to be conceived. What is more, they have
been designed to ﬁt almost every pocket-
book.

The money you spend on toys for your
child is an investment which can be a
good one, paying dividends—with the
ever-present possibility of future assess-
me-nts.

Parents, it’s up to you!

INSPECTING DONKEYS AT SOUK—EL-KHEMIS DONKEYS’ MARKET,

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Turtles—Land and Water

F. J.

ERHAPS no pet is more misunder-
P stood or thoughtlessly abused than

the ordinary little turtle. This is
largely due to a lack of knowledge on the
part of the owner. It is a great pity for
these little creatures ask little in the way
of food or care, but that little is very im-
portant in the health and preservation of
the lives of these pets. On the other
hand, the owners would undoubtedly be
willing to go to any length to satisfy
their needs if they knew what these
needs were.

It is not an uncommon sight to see
turtles in stores piled high on top of
one another in an aquarium far too small,
with little or no water therein. Some
appear quite lifeless in their struggle to
remain alive, and one comes away with
a feeling of disgust that something isn’t
done to alleviate the misery that results
from such careless negligence.

There are two kinds of turtles com—
monly used as house pets: The woodland
inhabitant, usually acquired by capture
while wandering about in the woods, can
be easily distinguished from the water
turtles by their higher backs and they
require much less care. They must have,
however, plenty of space in which to

crawl for exercise, a shallow bowl of
water from which to drink, and plenty
of leafy vegetables and pulpy fruit, such
as lettuce, grapes, plums, and bananas.
Two or three times a month a little fresh,
ground beef and ﬁsh and occasional bits
of dry bread.

As to the water-living species, they
must have a swimming pool in a rec—
tangular aquarium, large enough to
swim comfortably in two inches of water
at least. This must be so arranged as to
permit egress to and from a vegetated
area where they can crawl about and
rest in the sun at will, although sufﬁ-
cient shade must be provided for com-
fort. A plant or two with ﬂoppy leaves
will serve the purpose nicely. However,
they spend most of the time in the pool
and their food is always consumed under
the water. Sloping stones should be ar—
ranged around the edges of the pool for
access to dry “land.” The temperature
requirements of turtles in captivity are
exacting for they must not be subjected
to a temperature below 709 nor should
it be above lukewarm. The water in the
swimming pool must be changed as soon
as it fouls, which is fairly often.

The prime rule to observe in the feed-
ing of turtles is to provide a wide va-
riety. In my opinion and from past ex—
perience, ant eggs, aside from having no
food value, are really harmful because of
their acid content. They produce blind-
ness and languor which eventually lead
to permanent blindness and death. A re-
stricted diet of this kind or an otherwise
faulty one cannot be prolonged without
hurting the health of the turtle, which
will be easily manifest by the softening
of the shell and the development of whit-
ish areas on the back and a noticeable
lack of appetite. Sick turtles can often-
times be reclaimed by proper diet and
plenty of sunshine. If your pet does not
eat at all, a few drops of cod liver oil
daily may be efﬁcacious.

Thousands of these aquatic types of
turtles are caught in the swampy South-
lands and shipped North every year.

The health and longevity of the turtle
depends entirely upon the common-sense
rules applied to the environment in na-
ture from which they sprang.

The praying mantis created insect
thermos bottles as a protection to her
eggs long before man ever thought of
such a thing. She puts a frothy mass of
bubbles around the eggs. This mass
works on the same principle as our ther-
mos bottles, so no matter how cold or
how warm the air becomes the tender
eggs are protected.

Civilization
HOSE of our readers fortunate
enough to have traveled extensively
in America, have undoubtedly found that
the average American is not only a
mighty ﬁne fellow but he can be found

in California as well as in Maine—in
Wisconsin and in Florida.

If you have been abroad, you can per-
haps remember the friendly young Brit-
isher who talked with you so pleasantly
on the train. You liked him especially
when you discovered that his ideas on
decent living, religion and the future
were fundamentally like your own. In
other countries you Visited on the Con-
tinent you also found very charming peo-
ple who thought and reasoned as you did.

Stop to think, then, of what is happen-
ing in the world today. Russia and
Germany are suffering 15,000 men killed
daily, and President Roosevelt announced
the war will cost the United States 100
billion dollars in 1943. Think what one
billion dollars could do for slum clearance,
schools and better living conditions!

The war, of course, must be won, and
perhaps even more important, the peace.
We hope some of the average men of all
the nations involved in this struggle can
participate in the peace conferences and
offer some of their very sane and sound
advice because, as Dean Inge has said in
“My Utopia,” “We can be as civilized as
we truly wish to be civilized.”

With the return of horses it becomes
a humane and progressive act to restore
and replace the drinking fountains. The

need of them becomes more and more
1mperative.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Cruelty at Chicken Hatchery

AUL Small of East Longmeadow, Mas-

sachusetts, was found guilty in Dis-
trict Court, Springﬁeld, recently, of
unnecessarily failing to provide food,
drink and shelter for hatching baby
chicks. Fred Hall, our agent in that city,
brought the complaint.

The defendant was charged with hav-
ing instructed a truck driver in his
employ to dump several so-called rejected
eggs in the Kibbe Avenue dump in East
Longmeadow early on the afternoon of
August 4th. .

Soon after the eggs were dumped, sev-
eral dozen reacted to the heat of a
smouldering dump ﬁre on which they
were thrown and a number of featherless
chicks, some still carrying pieces of shell
of the eggs from which they had hatched,
were seen running around the dumping
grounds.

Some of the neighbors went to the
dump and brought home a few of the
new-born chicks. One man, who testiﬁed
in court, said he picked up seven and
nursed them along to good health, losing
only three.

Defense counsel raised interesting
points of law, contending that this client
was charged with unnecessarily failing
to provide food, drink and shelter for
something which he didn’t know existed.
He contended that the several thousand
eggs were thrown onto the dump because
they failed to hatch in the usual 21 to 22
days, and the ﬁrst he knew of any incu-
bation was several days later.

Animal War Casualty at Sea

THE tragedy of the ﬁre that swept the
Navy transport “Wakeﬁeld” in mid-
Atlantic on September 3 had a peculiar
signiﬁcance to animal-lovers everywhere.
Fortunately, all 1,600 men aboard the
ﬂaming ship were rescued. The only liv-
ing thing to perish was a cat that had
come originally from Malta. A Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts, man, returning
home on the “Wakeﬁeld,” told how he
and his companions tried to save the cat.
“I was with some men who brought
her all the way from Malta,” he said.
“She got through ﬁve bombings without
a scratch, and we got her off the burning
‘Wakeﬁeld,’ but she fell from the deck
of a cruiser that rescued us and that was
the last we saw of her.”
All lovers of animals will appreciate
the spirit of kindness toward animals
which led these men in their desire to

save the unfortunate cat, even to face
death itself.

For pleasure and recreation, for work
and business, for health and that keep-
young spirit most of us have, there’s
nothing to equal a good riding horse!

Amusing Reading

'PHILOSOPHERS are supposed to be

lovers of wisdom, and so very wise
men. Some of them have been and some
of them still are lovers of wisdom, but
some of them apparently are so wise that
even no one can understand them. Think
of the following as a deﬁnition of “heat,”
by that exalted German philosopher,
Hegel, the purpose of whose philosophy
was to explain the whole universe of
thought and being in its abstractest ele-
ments and minutest details:

“Heat is the self-restoration of matter
in its formlessness, its liquidity; the
triumph of its abstract homogeneity
over speciﬁc deﬁniteness; its abstract,
purely self-existing continuity as nega-
tion of negation is here set as activity.”

If, as Talleyrand once said, “words are
used to conceal one’s meaning,” this
wonderful (?) thinker surely never in-
tended anyone should know what he
thought heat was. The great Apostle
evidently meant no disrepect for man’s
ﬁnest and noblest wisdom, but when He
said, “The wisdom of this world is fool-
ishness with God,” one might think that
He had in mind some such foolishness

as this German philosopher might some
day write.

“Bambi”

THOUSANDS who have enjoyed read—
ing Felix Salten’s delightful story
about a deer will undoubtedly want to see
the motion picture produced by Walt Dis-
ney. Animal lovers, of course, have known
for a long time that Disney has a very
keen regard for all sentient life, and his
many charming animated cartoons have
time and time again pointed out that
cruelty is vicious, and kindness a virtue.
Time magazine, in reviewing the pic-
ture, had this to say:

“Bambi has an all-animal cast, but
man is present by implication. Disney’s
indictment of men who kill animals for
sport is so effective that U. S. sportsmen
who have seen the picture are gunning
for him. They feel that Disney is un-
doing their lifework of conserving wild
animals for future open seasons. After
Bambi they may have a hard time con-
vincing Disneyacs.”

F irst-Aid Classes Resumed

Due to the ever-increasing requests
for instruction in ﬁrst aid to animals,
the staff veterinarians of our Angel] Me-
morial Hospital will again this fall con-
duct classes. Persons interested in at-
tending should address a postcard or

New Year in Old Russia
K a d r a M a y s i

In the land of frost and winter—where the
tanks and caissons go

Like prehistoric monsters such as crawl in
bloody snow—

There was kept an olden custom. On the
morn of New Year’s Day,

From the farms, a horse was chosen and
was decked with berries gay.

He was led by dancing peasants to the
overlord’s estate,

Where the nobleman had ordered that they
open door and gate.

Through the castle doors he entered, and
the charger's hoofbeats rang

On its floors of gilt and tiling while the
peasants laughed and sang.

And a quaint procession followed,- for each
farmer led his beast

And the women carried poultry on the day
of gift and feast.’

So they gave their New Year greeting—on
a mom of long ago—

In a land where armies battle to the death
in bloody snow.

you have told all your troubles to their
patient ears; have romped and raced
with them; when you have shielded them
with-your small body from, perhaps, a
just licking; when you have been con-
cerned over an injured paw, or a wound
that does not heal or a habit that is
fraught with danger; when you have
urged an unwanted meal, or tried to pre-
scribe a nauseous pill or applied an odor-
ous liquid; when you have gone to bed
and remained awake over their disap-
pearance, or, rising at gray dawn, crept
with fearful thought to assure their re—
turn; when, as a boy, you have suffered
all this — and more — it takes courage
to get one for your own sons.

But I have done it. And, in memory,
perhaps, of those three that spanned so
much of my childhood, I gave them a
collie. And we have named him “Peter,”
too. How snugly he ﬁts into our little
home! How readily he has made our
family of two boys, a family of three!
Oh, I try to exercise a restraint over
him. I worry, with an emotion none of
them understands, when they are not
all at home. I think of cars rolling a
little too swiftly along this tree-dotted

The President’s Dog

JAMES ALBERT DECKER

FALA,” President Roosevelt’s Scotch
terrier, is probably the most famous
dog in America today. Fala, also spelled
Falla, was present at the Roosevelt—
Churchill meeting a few months ago,
and his escapades then were published
in many newspapers throughout the
country. It was reported that he escaped
from a ship’s ofﬁcer, who was attempt-
ing to keep him out of mischief while
the important conference was on, and
jumped playfully around the President
and Mr. Churchill. That is the sort of
dog Fala is; mischievous and light-
hearted, though he does at times assume
an air of dignity beﬁtting a dog belong-
ing to the Chief Executive of this nation.

Fala, who was presented to the Presi-
dent by a close friend, is short for Mur—
ray of Falahill, one of President Roose—
velt’s rugged Scottish ancestors. The
name, therefore, is highly appropriate
since Fala’s canine ancestors originally
came from bonny auld Scotland.

Fala receives only one meal a day,
consisting of mixed vegetables and meat,
and this is usually served to him by the
President, who takes no chances on en-
dangering the dog’s health by overfeed-
ing him.

The Scottie gets sufﬁcient exercise,

too. He takes walks accompanied by
either a secret service guard, or the
President’s colored valet. He also has a
special enclosure near the executive ofﬁ-
ces to which he can retire, as one re-
porter said, “when the goings inside get
too tiresome.”

The President during his leisure mo-
ments often reads his favorite detective
stories with faithful Fala by his side.
Between man and dog there is that in-
separable bond which exists between
many a dog and his master. Fala ap—
pears constantly in company with the
President, and has traveled quite ex-
tensively. He has met many prominent
people, but, friendly though he is, be
naturally reserves most of his affection
for the Roosevelt family, particularly
for the President.

Our Hospital in Springfield

From Editorial in Evening Union, Springfield,
Mass, Dec. 6, 1941

HE S. P. C. A. Hospital was ten

years old Thursday, and thousands
in Springﬁeld and vicinity are familiar
with the good work it does. The com-
munity takes justiﬁed pride in the fact
that it is one of the most modern, eﬁici-
ent and up—to-date institutions of its
kind in the country.

The Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals has done a magniﬁ—
cent work in the world.

Here in our own city we have, in the
S. P. C. A. Hospital, concrete evidence
of the modern idea that animals are an
important part of God’s creation. We
are proud of it, proud to support it.

Introducing “Sniffy”
BEATRICE STARR
NIFFY” is a beautiful pure white Angora rabbit

with pink eyes, who claims the distinction of
being the world’s most traveled bunny. Barely six
years of age, she has already traveled over 96,000
miles in this country, Mexico, and Canada.

Sniﬁ'y walks at the end of a dog leash, with one of
her owners, Mr. or Mrs. Leo Watts, at its other end.
Pedestrians encountering Sniffy and her convoy usually
stare incredulously. Mrs. Watts is principal of the pub-
lic school in the little town of Calexico, California.
When a little boy pupil presented her with Sniffy, both
teacher and bunny took to each other so sincerely that
they have been inseparable friends ever since.

Sniﬂ’y, instead of living in an out-door kennel, is
permitted the run of the house, the same as a dog or
kitten. She is house-broken and on her travels with
Mrs. Watts has been permitted to share the same
rooms at the hotels, ride in the same elevators, and
scamper through halls and lobbies just as the two-
legged guests do.

Last year Sniffy took part in the egg-rolling festivi-
ties on the White House lawn at Easter time. She has
twice been guest of honor on a national radio broad-
cast. She is an excellent “watch-dog,” weighs eleven
pounds, eats lettuce, carrots, alfalfa, bananas, and
bird-seed! She does not play with other rabbits, is
afraid of dogs, but likes children very much.

They’re so badly bent,
But with wings like a fairy

“Copenhagen” —— a Famous War Horse

THE following inscription on a monument at Strath-
ﬁeldsaye, England, shows what one great military
leader thought of the help of his war horse:

“Here lies Copenhagen, the charger ridden by the
Duke of Wellington the entire day of the Battle of
Waterloo. Born 1808, died 1836.

“God’s humbler instrument, though meaner clay,
Should share the glory of that glorious day.”

Copenhagen, a handsome chestnut ﬁfteen hands
high, was the Duke’s favorite mount. Wellington paid
nearly two thousand dollars for him and rode him.
during the Battle of Victoria and on some of his cam-
paigns. Then came Waterloo, and Copenhagen’s mas-
ter mounted him at four o’clock in the morning and
remained upon him for eighteen hours.

Copenhagen was placed in retirement and had a
lazy, pleasant time of it the last dozen years of his life.

A Dozen More Hidden Birds

N each of the following sentences the names of three

birds are hidden. Can you ﬁnd them all?

1. We saw her slip Hal a rope of pearls and hand.
over her watch for safe keeping in his waterproof
pouch with the canvas back.

2. He soon had four heaps of ﬁsh from the sea
gleaming like silver, with some ﬁsh as much as ten
and a half inches long.

3. The waves tilt the boat too much for me to help,
so Bob ran to help them land as the waves could wreck
it entirely without help in landing.

4. We saw Dorothy beg return of her watch, then
Alfred started to town with the catch at once.

Correct answers will be found here next month.

Winged War-time Messengers
GLADYS JORDAN

IGH in the heavens, indistinct

against the blue, a tiny winged crea-
ture is speeding on its way. Suddenly,
from far below, comes a muﬂied report
and the bird falters, wavers, one wing
droops, half lifts, ﬂutters again; its ﬂight
becomes erratic, it sinks down, down to-
ward earth. Then an instinct, stronger
than life itself, a courage that deﬁes
death, lifts the tiny creature, drives it
on again toward its goal. Now high, now
low, winging out its ﬁnal race the bird
reaches its home base, bringing in safely
the message from the aircraft pilot that
means life to the men below. Once again
the homing pigeon has kept its age-old
record, “faithful unto death.”

Down through the ages man has made
much of the strange and unerring in-
stinct of the homing pigeons. Among
the ﬁrst to use the birds were the ancient
Persians and later the Greeks learned the
art from them, making their birds inter-
nationally famous. They used them both
for sport and for business. Stock brokers,
ﬁnanciers and even government agencies
made use of these pigeons in their busi-
ness, sending important messages by
code from city to city.

In times of war homing pigeons have
been used by various countries and many
a battle has been lost or won through
the message carried by these tiny winged
creatures of the air. At the present
time, England is making great use of
these birds. Even some months ago Great
Britain had made up an army of 500,000
homing pigeons to serve as carriers with
its Royal Air Force. These birds carry
messages from reconnoissance planes to
their bases, when to send such a message
by radio might prove fatal. Carefully
trained for speed, endurance and accu-
racy, these birds are of inestimable value
to the men of the air.

Early in the nineteenth century a civil
and military system was established in
Java and Sumatra for the use of homing
pigeons. In 1870 they were used in the
siege of Paris and since then they have
been used both by the military and the
navy posts, with great success and at a
great saving of human life. Many ways
have been tried by the enemy to interrupt
the ﬂight of these war-time messengers.
The Germans used Falcon Hawks against
them in the 1870 siege of Paris and vari-
ous other birds of prey have been tried.
The Chinese used to attach tiny bells
and whistles to their homing pigeons so
as to frighten away all marauders.

Not only are these birds used in times
of war but in times of peace man turns
to them for sport. Belgium led in the
training of homing pigeons for long dis-
tance ﬂights in 1818.

Such pigeons are most carefully fed
and trained. Their owners start train-

Before a storm hits the great lakes, one versed in the legends of the lake area
can tell that a storm is coming from the behavior of the gulls which swarm over
the water and about the docks by the thousands.

After the storm actually comes the white and gray birds ﬂy out over the
water, coming to rest on the waves and riding them like bits of down through the

heaviest storms.

At night most of the birds also ride the waves and arise from the mist shrouded
waters like spirits at the ﬁrst showing of the sun.

ing them when the birds are about four
months old. At ﬁrst the pigeon ascends
in a sort of spiral ﬂight and continues so
until some familiar landmark is sighted,
then it wings its way straight forward.
Weather has much to do with its speed.
A record of 270 miles in three and a quar-
ter hours stands against the same dis—
tance in thirty hours on a stormy day,
but whatever the day or the weather the
homing pigeon will do its best, in war or
peace, to keep untarnished the self-made
record of the birds themselves, “faithful
unto death.”

Winged creatures of the blue,
Keeping faith with those below;

How great the debt we owe to you
Only you and God may know.

Be a Protector of Wildlife

HENRY H. GRAHAM

N the same autumn day I had two

wholly different experiences. While
studying Nature along a lonely marsh
I encountered a duck hunter. Proudly
pointing to his “bag” of ten ducks he
said, “The birds ﬂew well today. I got
the limit.”

Elation was written all over his face.
He seemed to think that in bowling over
ten beautiful and defenseless wild ducks
he had done something of which to be
justly proud. In his opinion he had ac-
complished something really big and out-
standing. I had other ideas. I saw him
as a killer, a destroyer of wildlife—a man

who put hunting under the erroneous
heading of sport and who gloried in
bringing death to birds that had as good
a right to live as he did. I felt that he
was a person I would not care to know
intimately.

That same night I was entertained in
the home of a friend. This fellow never
carried a gun. But he had a ﬁne “bag,”
too. Yet what a different sort of collec-
tion than the hunter! My friend showed
me dozens of beautiful color photographs
of wild ducks and other game in ﬂight.
He climaxed the evening by displaying
motion pictures, also in color, of ducks,
pheasants, deer and other lovely crea-
tures. It was the most interesting eve-
ning I have ever spent.

Somehow I could not help contrasting
the two men. One had taken life. At
best he had only a few meals of roast
duck—and his memories. To most of us
such memories would not be happy ones.
The other chap had photographs of living
wildlife that would last forever. He had
the happy memories of days spent on the
marshes and in the ﬁelds and forests in
quest of pictures. No bitter memories
were his. He had preserved the memory
of his trips without doing a bit of harm
to the lovely creatures of ﬁeld and forest.

Many sportsmen and conservation de-
partments are always urging protection
of game, reduced bag limits and shorter
open seasons. Such an attitude is not
prompted by any desire to protect game
so that it may be happy and unmolested.
It is prompted by selﬁshness.

Autoists who conserve tires and gaso-

the lives of many wild birds and mam-
mals, predicts the Fish and Wildlife
Service, U. S. Dept. of the Interior.

A pastor on Britain’s Isle of Man re-
cently applied for a supplementary gaso-
line ration, working into his request this
appropriate Biblical quotation:

“Remember the commandment, ‘GO ye
into all the world and preach the gospel.’ ”

His request was turned down. At the
foot of the note of refusal was this:

“Yea, saddle me an ass.”

1. Question: I have a mongrel dog ten
years old, which, for the last two months,
has had spells of vomiting, and occasion-
ally has loose bowel movements. His
breath has a disagreeable Odor. He drinks
a great deal of water; his appetite is
good, but he has recently lost considerable
weight. We are very fond of him, and

should like to do anything possible to
save him.

Answer. Your dog is suffering from
nephritis, a disease of the kidneys, which
is not uncommon in dogs of his age. Little
encouragement can be given toward ef-
fecting a cure, as he will doubtless have
this trouble the rest of his life. How-
ever, there are medicines which may
serve to make him more comfortable, and
give him temporary relief.

The dog Should be allowed free access
to water at all times, and liquids should
be encouraged in his diet. Broth, milk,
and even fruit Juices may be given. Foods
low in protein content are to be recom-
mended in place of the meat and eggs
relished by a healthy animal. Thus,
cereals, either dry or cooked, wholewheat
bread, or certain of the prepared dog
foods may be fed. Fruits and vegetables
are excellent 1n substitution for the quan—
tities of meat normally fed. Butter and
other fats are also to be advised.

Care should be taken to ensure ade-
quate bowel movements, and laxatives
should be given at intervals.

Various urinary antiseptics, vitamin
preparations, and tonics are employed as
medication for this ailment. Your local
veterinarian should be consulted in re-
gard to speciﬁc treatment.

2. Question: How often should I bathe
my puppy?

Answer: It is not advisable to bathe
young puppies; as it pre-disposes them to
colds or distemper, and it is safer to keep
them dry during their ﬁrst year of life.
Mature dogs should not be bathed oftener
than once a month; a mild soap, such as
a toilet soap, should be used; and the dog
should be carefully dried afterwards.

In the case of puppies, sometimes a
damp cloth will remove Spots of dirt, or
a little soap may be used on the cloth.
Careful drying is necessary. Frequent
brushing will aid in keeping the puppy
clean, and dry cleaning is often success-
ful. For this purpose cornmeal or fuller’s
earth may be used, rubbing the substance
into the coat, while parting the hair to
aid distribution. This is followed by
brushing to remove the dirt and the
cleaning agent.

3. Question: What is the normal tem-
perature of a dog?

Answer: 100-102 degrees taken in the
rectum.

Francis of Assisi

From time to time, but rarely, there
comes into this world a man not like
other men; he is differently attuned to
the forces of nature; he hears voices, he
sees Visions; he is directed in dreams and
he follows. He values what other men
despise and he despises what other men
value. He is not acquisitive of the goods
of time for he has touched the eternal.
He is never sad for he is always in touch
with goodness and gladness. He has no
fear of death for he has glimpsed life.
He is not capable of ill will and hatred
for to him all life from highest to lowest
—human and sub—human—is ﬂooded with
love. Such a man was Francis of Assisi.

Humane Crusaders

JOHN WINTERS FLEMING

A SMALL group of women in Buffalo,

New York, banded together in 1867
to crusade against the mule drivers along
the old Erie Canal and thus pioneered a
path in animal protection in America.
Today the highly efﬁcient Erie County
S. P. C. A. is the outgrowth of the
kindly action of those brave women.

Headed by Mrs. John C. Lord, wife of
Dr. John C. Lord, nationally renowned
pastor, as its ﬁrst president, the little
band of women had as their ﬁrst objeC<
tive the elimination of the cruel practices
of the mule drivers along “Clinton’s
Ditch.”

The mule drivers drove their dumb
charges until they dropped in their
tracks as they laboriously towed the
heavily loaded canal boats up and down
the old Erie Canal.

The public looked upon the little band
of women in varying ways from complete
indifference to all—out ridicule. How could
women cope with the rough, tough mule
drivers! But the little band of humani-
tarians kept on in their errand of mercy.

Heading the Humane Education Com-
mittee, Miss Lucy S. Lord went to every
school in the city, carrying to the pupils
her message of mercy for dumb animals.
From her visits many auxiliary chap-
ters took root, ﬂowered and ﬂourished.

Slowly but surely the little society
grew in power and importance. During
the ﬁrst few years it had no central head-
quarters but it was not long before it
could afford three paid agents. One
worked in the stock-yards; the other two
worked all over the city.

Finally the city and county recognized
this force for mercy and the treatment
of dumb animals, including the mules
treading the towpaths of the old Erie
Canal, became manifestly and greatly
improved. '

Please remember the American Hu-
mane Education Society in your will.

A Far East Fellowship
JOHN COLVILLE

LL of us, who pride ourselves (and

justly so) on the humane treatment
of animals in our day, should feel a
fellowship with the J ains of India.

For hundreds of years, the members
of this powerful and wealthy sect, have
been friends and benefactors of all living
creatures. Not only the types of animal
life we like for pets and helpers, but the
lower forms of life that have not been
fashioned as attractively to the eye or
touch.

I recall reading a number of years ago
in an old book of travel in India, printed
about 1880, an account of the author’s
visit to the great Animal Hospital in
Bombay, one of the largest of many such
institutions supported by the Jain Fra-
ternity throughout India.

Each kind of animal which included
horses, oxen, cows, sheep, goats, cats,
and monkeys, had separate living quar-
ters. Skilled attendants cared for them,
providing plenty of clean straw and water
—feeding and bathing them, and giving
medical and surgical attention when nec-
essary. Many of the animals had band-
ages over their eyes, apparently to cure
or relieve eye trouble.

Both wild and domestic birds had a
different section—and the writer told of
seeing old crows hopping happily about
on wooden legs.

Nor were insects or reptiles neglected.
They too, received help and attention in
their distress.

The author of this book said that Visit-
ing this ﬁne hospital was more interest—
ing than seeing any of the beautiful
Temples or Palaces in that wonderful
country.

That was sixty years ago. I trust it is
still carrying on its great work in spite
of the upset of war!

East may be East—and West may be
West. But kindness and justice to our
Dumb Friends creates a brotherhood that
does not know the limits of race, creed or
country.

Note: Among the vows of the Jains is “not to

kill.” This leads to a remarkable care to preserve
all living things. Even vermin must be preserved,
not killed.

This regard for all life is the result of religious
convictions, rather than the idea of kindness to ani-
mals, which is the basis of all modern humane
movements.

Smallest of the sea birds is the stormy
petrel, measuring no more than six or
seven inches long. While larger, stronger
birds make for home at the approach of
a storm, the petrel stays out. He is the
sailor’s sign of a big blow. From his
habit of tripping along the surface of
the water with a hop, skip and jump, he
has been named “Little Peter,” from the
Apostle Peter who walked upon the
waves.

Fawn in the Hills

Judy Van der Veer

 

The best thing I have seen today,

Or any day I know,

Was a young fawn walking in the hills
Beside a soft brown doe.

Its ears and eyes were very big,
Its legs were thin and long,

It seemed extremely new to be
So lively and so strong.

 

 

Among the rugged hills the doe,

The fawn and I seemed small,

The sky was stretched so far and wide.
The hills rose steep and tall.

Somehow it pleased me as I looked
At hills and spread of blue

That such a vastness should be home
For one so young and new.

It seemed all made to hide a fawn —
The bigness of the land,

The hills were kindly guardians,

The sky a sheltering hand.

Proverbs About the Horse

CHARLES A. DREW

A horse is a vain thing for safety.
Ps. 33. 17.

It is not best to swap horses when cross-
ing a stream.
PRESIDENT LINCOLN

Wild colts sometimes make good horses.
The master’s eye fattens the horse.

You shouldn’t look a gift horse in the
mouth.

You can lead a horse to water, but you
can’t make him drink.

If wishes were horses, beggars might
ride.

Don’t put the cart before the horse.

I will hold McClellan’s horse, if he will
only bring us success.
PRESIDENT LINCOLN

A man without religion is like a horse
without a bridle.

A lean horse for the race.
A short horse is soon curried.

He closed the stable door after the horse
had escaped.

And that’s a horse of quite another color.
He’s trying to ride two horses at one time.
The willing horse is always most ridden.
Every horse thinks his own pack heaviest.

For want of a nail, the shoe was lost;

For want of a shoe, the horse was lost;
For want of a horse the rider was lost;
For want of a rider the battle was lost.

 

A PRIZE PHOTOGRAPH

Good horses make short miles.

It’s a good horse that never stumbles.

Do not spur a free horse.

The best horse needs breaking, and the
aptest child needs teaching.

Set the saddle on the right horse.

A hungry horse makes a clean manger.

You can’t judge a horse by the harness.

Advice to the Hunted
H u r d

Dear hunted things, enjoy your present peace

Before these days of succulence decrease

Toward autumn when your brother, man—
grown keen

To kill—shall track you with his dogs. This
green

Which hides you now shall flutter to the
ground:

The skeletal trees shall echo with the sound

Of dissonant guns—be wary then: be fleet.

All hunted things, beware the stalking feet

Of men and dogs—they are in league with
death:

The setter, beating through the brush with
panting breath,

The hound-dog, hot upon the gentle hare,

And man, with gun a-swing, following
through the bare

And frosty woodland. Revel in this peace,

For your immunity from man shall cease

And you shall learn to fear the longer reach

Of death projected from a hammered breech

Of steel. The owl—hooting from a tree,

The screaming hawk, the weasel—stealthily

Approaching through the dark, the prowling
fox,

Must yield to predatory man, who talks

Of kindness while devising in his mind

Ways winged and motored to destroy his
kind,

So let all hunted things enjoy this peace

Before your armistice with man shall cease.

“Barnegat Pete,” Town Pet
MARJORY SMITH

SEVERAL years ago a Visitor to the

little town of Barnegat, New Jersey,
would be likely to rub his eyes and look
twice at the unique and heart-warming
picture to be seen any hour of the day
on the streets of the town or in the
country outside.

A graceful little tame deer, usually
surrounded by fondling children but
sometimes tripping along alone, wan—
dered Barnegat streets. It made an odd
ﬁgure in a little checkered coat. But the
visitor would probably be most impressed
by the large white tag hanging around
the deer’s neck, with prominently-dis-
played letters warning: “This is Barne-
gat Pete, Barnegat children’s playmate.
Don’t shoot!”

Deer are the most gentle and timid
creatures on earth, ﬂeeing at the sight
of a human being. But through the care
and kindness of a whole Village one,
Barnegat Pete, lived for four years in
the midst of human friends, tame and
without fear.

In 1935 a forest ﬁre just outside
Barnegat killed many woodland creatures
and sent others ﬂeeing for their lives.
Barnegat Pete was one of these gentle,
helpless animals who escaped death in
the ﬂames. Somehow he wandered into

ﬁlled ditch near International Falls, Minn. Janet Johnson is giving it an after-
noon feeding, while Bruce Ketola keeps the fawn from wobbling.

Mr. James Nankivell, executive agent of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty,
awarded Janet and Bruce a membership in the Junior Humane Society of Minnesota

Since it is against the law to raise deer in captivity, the fawn was turned over

the village, too weak and hungry to use
his ordinary caution about human beings.

Barnegat children discovered the little
deer, fed and cared for him until he was
strong again. The creature repaid their
kindness by becoming so tame that he
would not leave the town except for little
saunters into the country outside. He
even slept in Barnegat.

Hunters come to woods nearby Barne-
gat, and people who loved the innocent
grace of the tame deer feared for him
during the hunting season. Then some-
one devised the coat and sign which he
wore continually. For four years Barne-
gat Pete was the village mascot, pet of
all Barnegat children. And although he
has now become a mature deer and re-
turned to his life in the forest, it is safe
to say that Barnegat children have
learned a lasting lesson in love and kind-
ness to animals.

The Unsocial Porcupine

WILBERT N. SAVAGE

IKE quills upon the fretful porcupine
is a comparison that has been com-
mon ever since Shakespeare put it into
the mouth of one of the characters in
“Hamlet.”
But actually the porcupine is not par-
ticularly fretful. He is always quite
calm and collected except when suddenly

surprised or aroused to anger. Mr.
Porcupine really doesn’t enjoy getting
angry, and he will avoid contact with
those who would harm him if at all pos—
sible. If there is any one thing that the
porcupine loves to do best of all, it is to
tend strictly to his own business. Per—
haps that is why he does virtually all of
his traveling and feeding under cover
of darkness, and spends the day hiding
in hollow trees and among rocks.

Oddly enough, the ﬂesh of the porcu—
pine is edible, and in some sections of the
country it is considered a real delicacy.
Many states protect the porcupine be—
cause it has been a source of food for the
Indians and settlers.

Contrary to a strange belief, the por-
cupine cannot “shoot” its quills at its
opponents; such stories arise from the
fact that the quills are loosely inserted in
the skin, and become detached at a touch.
They make painful wounds, for small
barbs at their tips cause them to work
deeper into the ﬂesh of its Victims.

If animals ever have mottoes, I think
the porcupine’s would be: “I never harm
those who do not treat me unkindly.”
And the “quilly” fellow, whom most peo-
ple sorely misunderstand, might add:
“Mother Nature created me a bit selﬁsh
and grouchy, but it’s partly self-con—
sciousness, for you see I seem to realize
that I am one of the homeliest of all
animals.”

The Cat and .Music

ALAN BROWUJ

HO does not derive pleasure from

the contented purring of a cat? The
cat language is musical. It is a combina-
tion of pleasant, soothing sounds. The
tones are often caressing.

This association of the cat with musical
sounds is not an original observation.
As long ago as 1000 B. C. the Egyptians
coupled the cat with music, and utilized
a reproduction of the head and ﬁgure of
the beloved animal in the decoration of
musical instruments.

There are, of course, many more recent
facts, anecdotes and stories associating
the feline friend with the musical arts.
In the familiar nursery rhyme, “The Cat
and the Fiddle,” the animal acquires the
status of a virtuoso. Tschaikowsky in
his ballet, “La Belle au Bois Dormant,”
included a dialogue between Puss-in-
Boots and The White Cat.

Gautier is reported to have had a silver-
gray Angora who would listen to music
with deep satisfaction and would often
go so far as to pick her way up and down
the keys of the piano. Another author
observed his cat had a particular pen-
chant for “playing” the piano in the
middle of the night.

There is a legend of a cat who fur-
nished a composer with a musical theme
because of its habit of running up and
down the piano keyboard. One of Scar-
latti’s compositions is titled “The Cat’s

cat; and the people
passing in the street used to listen and
wonder.”

My Cats Teach Me

ELISABETH VAN PRAAG DUDLEY

My cats teach me politeness. When I
pat them, if they are seated, they rise.

My cats teach me patience. At meal
times, they wait silently in a corner of
the kitchen, until I see ﬁt to give them
their meal.

My cats teach me consideration. Be-
cause they gaze at me reproachfully when
I turn the radio loud and disturb their
naps, I tune it down.

My cats teach me thoughtfulness for
others. Who can enjoy a meal when a
pair of green eyes and a pair of topaz
eyes watch wistfully every bite?

My cats teach me reﬁnement. Because
they dislike noise, I enter rooms quietly.
I do not slam doors. Because abrupt
movements startle them, I move gently.

My cats teach me fortitude. When
“Dusky” was taken to a veterinarian to
have a tooth out, he neither struggled
nor made a noise; and he purred after-
wards.

My cats teach me gratitude. A few
pats on the head set “Dusky” purring
like a smooth-running engine; a scrap
from the table elicits a veritable sere-
nade of purring.

My cats teach me repose. “Peewee”
lies motionless on the window-sill medi-

Purr-Cat
William P. Fowler

Your forebears saw the pyramids begun,
And purred upon a Pharaoh’s royal bed;
Crouched between pillars of the Parthenon
Your ancestors watched Attic suns rise red,-
In Rome’s Augustan Age a gray Maltese
Kitten, whose blood you own, once
paused from play
To purr on mats of Sybaritic ease
In some white villa of the Appian Way.-
And whether you can trace your far descent
From London cats that Geoffrey Chaucer
knew,
Or Pilgrim cats who reached this continent
As storm-drenched mascots of the May-
flower’s crew,
It matters not,—-for in your ardent purring
The pulse of feline friendship still is
stirring!

 

paws; Dusky sits long hours in a sunny
window, watching with serene yellow eyes
the world hurrying by.

My cats tea-ch me forgiveness. Dusky,
because he is blackout black, and because
of his unfailing love for mankind which
brings him where people gather, suﬂ’ers
much unintentional abuse. He is stepped
on, pushed around, shut in dark places.
Does he hold it against us? Never. Pick
him up and apologize, and his purring
apparatus is in instant action.

My cats teach me faith in a higher
power. Their trust in me is implicit.
They look to me for food, shelter, love
and protection; whatever may come, they
know I will not fail them.

Hoof Beats Down the Years
MARJORIE HUNT PETTIT

ITTLE thippus, the Dawn Horse,
was not much larger than a fox
terrier. His color is not known with
certainty, but he is supposed to have been
more or less striped, like a zebra, prob-
ably with a dun-colored background.
Often he is pictured as being spotted,
resembling a young fawn. It took ap-
proximately 3,000,000 years of evolution
through various stages to bring the horse
to his present form and size. The zebra
is assumed to be a connecting link be-
tween the prehistoric animal and the
modern horse, as are also the wild ass of
Asia and Africa and Przewalskii’s horse
of Mongolia.

Although the prehistoric horses were
native to all parts of the world, they had
disappeared from the American Con-
tinent before the white man arrived.
Hernando Cortez, leading his Spanish
Conquistadores to victories in Mexico,
brought sixteen horses with him. The
Aztecs were terriﬁed, thinking that man
and horse were one amazing four-legged
creature come to destroy them.

The horse was introduced into Egypt
by the Hyksos when they invaded that
country in the 18th century B.C. Before
long the Egyptians were importing horses
from Asia for their own use. They were
driven to the war chariots but at ﬁrst
were seldom ridden. The Egyptians held
the horse in the highest esteem. When
one died it was wrapped in bandages,
enclosed in a huge cofﬁn and given an
elaborate burial.

The Israelites, in the days of the
patriarchs, seem not to have known the
horse. As they progressed into Palestine,
they found the Canaanites using horses
and war chariots. David, after defeat-

 

}, :5.“ a. l " ' I

NOBLE ST

ing the king of northwestern Syria, kept
from slaughter enough horses to draw a
hundred chariots. Solomon, a little later,
had 12,000 cavalry horses. The horse is
mentioned all through the Bible in con-
nection with war.

The pure Arabian horses have their
origin, according to recognized authority,
in ﬁve famous mares owned by Sheik
Salaman of southern Arabia. This an-
cestry extends back many, many centuries
before the time of Mohammed. The best
Arabian horses are found in the desert
region among the migratory Bedouin
tribes. Somewhere around 1765 an Arab
stallion named “Ranger” was imported to
New London, Connecticut. He sired a

half-breed gray son, used by General

Washington during the Revolution.

When Charles Darwin visited Argen-
tina he was amused at the huge carts
with wheels ten feet high, drawn by six
or more horses driven abreast. Horses
were so cheap in the early pioneer days
of Argentina, that horse grease was
burned in the street lamps of Buenos
Aires.

In the Faroe Islands, far to the north
of Scotland, the small native ponies eat
ﬁsh heads when grass is not available.
Years ago they were trained to ride down
a sheep and hold it securely with the
forelegs until the rider could dismount
and take charge of it.

Hungarian herdsmen graze their
horses in vast unfenced pastures. Al-
though the animals are not branded, each

- owner can pick his horses unerringly

from the herd. Saddles are very light,
made without a pommel, and no girth is
used to hold them in place.

In certain parts of Iraq, horses are fed
on camel’s milk when grass and other
forage disappears. The camel can ﬁnd

a living where the horse would starve.

Run Safe, Red Fox

E. P. Rockwell

Where do you run, red fox, like errant
flame
Coursing its trek across the broken lands,
Nudging the fern knolls and the pasture
lane,
Scenting the damp and cool of river
sands?

Why do you pause, red fox, a silhouette
Against the varied green? What breath
of snare
Or blatant drum of pack in lethal threat
Disputes your way and cautions to be-
ware?

Deny these avid perils that await,
The stratagems and cruelties that assail,
Upon the wrinkled mold of nature’s slate;
Run safe, red fox, along your veering
trail.

 

The Bedouin loves his mare and shares
his black goats’-hair tent with her, but
he disdains the stallion.

In Salzburg, Austria, there are bathing
places for horses. In China there is a
Washing Horse Pond. Ponies in Chinese
Turkistan and other parts of High Tar-
tary are taught certain gaits known as
the Big Amble and the Small Amble.

Jonathan Swift, in his fanciful story
of “Gulliver’s Travels,” tells of a horse,
called Houyhnhnm, which was endowed
with the ability to reason.

Feathered Gypsies

A band of gypsy birds paused for a
short time in the mulberry tree of my
garden this summer. I heard them as
they spoke to one another in hissing syl-
lables. These feathered vagabonds were
cedar waxwings and were dressed in
sleek coats of grayish-brown. Flakes of
scarlet, resembling wax, brushed their
wings; their tails were tipped with yel—
low. Raised crests made them look dis-
tinguished. These cedar birds are said
to be unusually courteous to each other;
but they didn’t give me a chance to ob-
serve their manners for, after sampling
my berries, they ﬂew away as unexpect-
edly as they had come. In this short stop
between ﬂights, the debonair wanderers
left me an unforgettable moment and a
treasured memory.

IDA JOSEPHINE BRITTAIN

The great majority of the American
people are extremely sensitive to the
suffering of animals. An ill-treated horse
on a street breeds instant champions. The
reason why animals are exploited for
stage purposes is due to the widespread
ignorance with regard to their treatment.
Enlightenment is steadily growing.

Honors to Dr. Rowley

President Rowley was recently tendered
a surprise reception by his many friends
and associates. It was not only the
occasion of his birthday, but also a recog-
nition of his long service, now a full
generation, as leader and guide of the
Massachusetts S. P. C. A. and life-long
exponent of humane education.

It was a happy gathering of the So-
ciety’s large family, ofﬁcials, doctors, and
employees, who, with outside friends, had
sent ﬂowers in choice profusion to mark
the pleasant occasion.

Congratulatory messages were received
from Governor Saltonstall and Mayor
Tobin and the good wishes of many others
were extended in person and by letter to
Dr. Rowley.

Among those present were members of
the Marine Corps from the Hingham
Station, with their mascot Great Dane;
also a delegation of Junior Police from
Station 10, Roxbury, which has 'just made
Dr. Rowley an honorary member of that

Might, and in that faith let us dare to

PRESIDENT ROWLEY ACCEPTS CERTIFICATE OF MEMBERSHIP IN JUNIOR POLICE

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Apostles of Humanity
Editorial in Boston Herald, July 24

HE Massachusetts Society for the

Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is
probably rivaled in magnitude of work
and world inﬂuence only by the Royal
Society of England. Our institution has
been in existence for 74 years. Its whole
history is embodied in the careers of two
men, George Thorndike Angell, who
served as its president for 41 years, and
Dr. Francis H. Rowley, who has been in
ofﬁce for 32 years. Mr. Angell reached
what was described as the “advanced
age” of 86. Dr. Rowley will attain his
88th birthday tomorrow. He carries on
with remarkable vigor and ability, com—
ing regularly to his ofﬁce every day, and
rightly proud of his rank as probably
the oldest living oﬂicer of the humane
movement in this country. Both animal-
kind and human—kind are the better for
the labors of such men.

That presidency is no small job. The
Angel] Memorial Hospital is the largest
and best equipped institution of its kind
in the world. That and the society’s hos-
pital in Springﬁeld receive about 40,000
animals a year for treatment. There
were 900,000 investigations and inspec-
tions in 1941. The working force com-

Page 169

prises scores of men and women, includ-
ing a corps of excellent veterinarians.
The society indoctrinates children with
its fundamental principle of kindness to
animals and teaches people of all ages
that they degrade themselves by brutality
to these defenseless fellow creatures. The
society is helping to build a better world
by its work of humane education.

The appeal below, made by another
Humane Society, we are making as our
own. These are difﬁcult times for all
established charitable organizations:

“But to keep that beacon burning there
must be oil for the lamp. No good work,
not even the largely voluntary activities
of an S. P. C. A., can live on sentiment
alone.

“It is just at this point that we ask all
readers of this article to make a heart-
searching appeal to themselves and to
their friends in support of the Society’s
work.”

Our readers are urged to clip from
“Our Dumb Animals” various articles
and request local editors to republish.
Such copies of the magazine so mutilated
will be replaced by us upon application,
if so desired.

OSTRICHES ON THEIR FEEDING GROUNDS,

She Lifts Her Head

GENEVIEVE D. O’NEILL

AVEST thou the goodly wings unto
the peacocks ? or wings and feathers
unto the ostrich which leaves her eggs
and warms them in dust, and forgets
that the foot may crush them or that the
wild beast may break them? She is
hardened against her young ones, as
though they were not hers. Her labor is
in vain without fear; because God has
deprived her of wisdom. Neither has
He imparted to her understanding. What
time she lifts her head on high she scorns
the horse and his rider.”

This quotation from the Book of Job
(Chapter 39) shows us in what lowly
esteem Nature’s largest and strongest
fowl was held centuries ago. Yet with a
stroke of its foot it could knock down a
man! Even today we consider it de-
prived of wisdom and one of the most
stupid of birds. And the chief cause of
our reasoning is that, when exhausted
and disheartened after a chase, it throws
itself prone upon the ground, neck out-
stretched, head lying low in desert sands.

In ﬂeeing its pursuer an ostrich does
not use its Wings, except to open them
part way and ﬂap them against its sides
to give ballast. While doing this, it
lowers its head and pushes it forward,
so as to streamline the body against
winds, crooking and vibrating the neck
meanwhile to enable itself to see clearly
on all sides. So ﬂeet of foot is it that
only the swiftest of horses are used to
capture it, hunters forcing it to run in
circles until it is worn out.

Lying prone on the ground at the close

of the chase has won for the ostrich the
repute that it imagines it is hiding from
its pursuer when it stretches its neck
out upon the sands. However, ten to one
it is recuperating in the false hope of
further prolonging its ﬂight and thus
ultimately escaping.

If an ostrich understood human ways,
it certainly would be amused at the great
to-do we make over our golden weddings;
for during the lifetime of these birds,
which is said to average about seventy-
ﬁve years, it is not uncommon for a
couple to spend sixty-ﬁve of them to-
gether.

Where sands are warm these largest
of all birds depend upon the sun to hatch
their eggs; but when held captive in a
cooler climate, where nights are chilly
and the sands never as warm as in a
desert, Mother and Dad take turns on the
nest, Mother having the daylight hours
to brood while Dad watches by night,
their vigil lasting forty days. Had you
the opportunity to peep into their nest,
you would ﬁnd both round and oval eggs
there, and when the vigil is over little
males will issue from the round ones and
females from the others. Then it is that
Mrs. Ostrich lifts her head very high
indeed, and not only scorns riders and
their horses, but every other living thing
except her own.

Apart from all questions of policy and
interest, the observance of mercy and
kindness toward dumb animals is rich in
pure, indeﬁnable satisfaction. It blesses
not only the lower being which is the
recipient of it, but doublyhim who prac-
tises it.

Spring’s Message

C. H. HUEY'

How are you, Mr. Bluebird!
You feathery little thing!
You came home proudly telling

Of the coming of the Spring.
The jonquils rise to meet you

And nod their yellow heads,
While maple babes are waking

From downy little beds.

How are you, little Bluebird!
Is that your oaroling?

‘ Then, lovely little ohorister,
Please teach us how to sing.

It seems to me you’re saying
Midst sparkling flash of blue:
“Be thankful for your blessings—
Then you’ll be singing, too.”

Theodore Parker and the Turtle

SAW a little spotted turtle, sunning itself in the shal—

low water, wrote Theodore Parker, I lifted the stick
in my hand to kill it; for though I had never killed any
creature, yet I had seen other boys, out of sport, destroy
birds, squirrels, and the like, and I had a disposition to
follow their example; but all at once something checked
my little arm, and a voice within me said, clear and loud,
“It is wrong.” I held my uplifted stick in wonder at the
new emotion, till the turtle vanished from sight.

I hastened home and told the tale to my mother, and
asked what it was that told me it was. wrong. She wiped
a tear from her eye and taking me in her arms. said:
“Some men call it conscience, but I prefer to call it the
voice of God in the soul of man. If you listen and obey it,
it will speak clearer and clearer and always guide you
right; but if you turn a deaf ear or disobey, then it will
fade out little by little, and leave you in the dark without
a guide. Your life, my son, depends on heeding that little
v01ce.”

THIS PHOTOGRAPH OF A BABY ROBIN WAS TAKEN

“Good Morning, Mr. Robin”

JOHN H. JOLLIEF

NE of these bright mornings you children are go-

ing to look out of your several windows and cry,
“Good Morning, Mr. Robin,” for there on the lawn will
be not one but three or four of these birds, just back from
a winter’s vacation spent in the warm southland. He is
a sign of spring for which you usually watch. Like most
travelers, he will be grateful for any food you may give
him.

Robins like people; they also like domestic animals.
They don’t mind feeding with the chickens in the barn-
yard. You need not worry about the robins getting their
share, either.

Robins become very angry if their nests or little ones
are disturbed. One boy climbed a tree to look at some
robin’s eggs and received a sound scolding from the
female robin. After that whenever the boy left the house
and came near the tree where the nest was the mother
bird would ﬂy straight at his head, only swerving aside
when some six feet away. -

Robins do not forgive or forget the intruder or tres-
passer. They do respond to kind treatment, however,
and like to build their nests near dwellings. One pair
even built their nest on my front porch only a few feet
from the doorway and the sidewalk where many people
passed daily.

Egrets on the Pond

Louise Darcy

When suddenly the egrets came

With plumage white,heads tipped with flame,
They lighted on the meadow pond,

Nor left to swiftly soar beyond.

No man would do such beauty harm

That strayed far north from waters warm,
But all stood wondering at the sight

Of crimson glory, feathers white.

50 some great beauty stirs the heart
With wonder in each secret part,
Making of man a higher thing,
Touched by the grace of snowy wing.

Reforestation Results
WILLIS MEHANNA

OWA’S National Forest areas, state
parks, artiﬁcial lakes and small refor-
ested plots on private farms, these latter
often surrounding ponds, are beginning
to show gratifying results. In localities
where ten years ago bird life was scarce
now birds are coming back in increasing
numbers. The National Forest areas
are mostly in the southeastern portion
of the state, that part being more hilly
and better adapted to such enterprises.

In one of these areas, not far from the
center of the state, members of the Audu-
bon Society counted sixty—three species
of birds during the spring of 1941. This
count did not include such birds as
English sparrows, sharp-shinned hawks,
Cooper’s hawks and crows. Some of the
birds counted had not been observed in
the state for several years. Ponds and
thickets of small trees are better suited
to more different kinds of birds than
are large trees. Thick growths of big
weeds at the edges of ponds are good
nesting—places for some kinds of birds.
These ponds and small plots of trees are
always fenced in to protect the birds
from the ravages of livestock. The
people are conservation-minded now.
Let us hope that they will remain that
way.

Bob-White—Model Husband

ALVIN M. PETERSON

1T would be nearer the mark to say that
the bob-white not only is a model hus-

band but a model father also. I was
not aware of this characteristic of this
chubby, hen-like bird until last summer,
when I got at least two glimpses that
seemed to settle the matter.

True, I often had heard his clear, cool
sparkling “bob-white” coming from the
vicinity of the nest, where he was doing
his best to entertain his mate, singing to
let her know she was not alone and make
sure time did not hang heavily upon her
hands. Whether he ﬁnds and carries
food to her while she is brooding as some
birds do, I cannot say, since bob-whites
are sensitive and one must be careful to
keep at a distance when they are nesting.
Nor do I know whether he takes a turn on
the nest and thus gives her a chance to
ﬁnd a bite to eat and secure a rest. But
I do know that he is one of the family
group after the young birds have left the
nest.

Bob-whites have large eggs for the size
of the bird, and the young are precocious
and run around with their parents almost
as soon as they are out of the shell. After
this momentous event, both parents guard
and ﬁnd food for the youngsters. I was
crossing the garden last summer, when,
with much cheeping, a number of tiny
young bob-whites began to run here and
there in great alarm. Both parents were
with them. The mother ﬂew off a few
yards, but the father refused to take to
his wings. Instead, he began to utter
sharp notes of alarm, spread his wings
and ﬂutter over the ground. Like so
many birds, he was dissembling, trying to
make me believe he was injured and doing
his best to divert my attention from the
young. Now he was here, now there, but
always ﬂuttering and crying. I did not
tarry long, for I did not want to prolong
the distress of the alarmed but brave
bird. -

Not long afterwards I was driving
down the road, when I saw a ﬂock of

young bob-whites about to cross the drive
ahead of me. The mother and one or two
of the youngsters crossed the road be—
fore I reached the vicinity and came to a
stop. Other youngsters now began to
burst from the grass on the opposite side
of the drive, one here, another there, all
cheeping loudly and in great alarm. Then
I heard and caught a glimpse of the male,
who was ﬂuttering in the tall grass and
doing all he could to attract and hold my
attention. I was not to be allowed to see
what became of the mother and young if
he could help it. This time, I was not sur-
prised, for I had seen something of a
male bob-White’s concern for his family
before. But I was glad to learn that the
former glimpse was not an isolated case
and that other male bob—whites also make
good husbands and fathers.

It Came Back Ten Times
C. BERNARD PETERSON

INGING its way thousands of

miles, over vast stretches of sea,
jungle and inhabited country, a chimney
swift came back to its nesting place in
Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. Not once has
the bird made this perilous trip from
remote South American forests Where
it winters, but ten times! This is some-
thing of a record in bird migration.

The bird was trapped at Swarthmore
by Dr. C. Brooke Worth, of the Zoology
Department at Swarthmore College. It
was ﬁrst caught in May, 1930. At that
time Dr. Worth slipped a little numbered
metal band on its leg. Since then he has
caught it three other times.

The swift was mature when ﬁrst taken
and banded, and was believed to be at
least one year old. Thus, when in the
spring of 1940 it was caught for the last
time, it must have been at least ten
years old. The average life of the chim-
ney swift is thought to be around ﬁve or
six years, yet this veteran of the migra—

Neighbors in the Snow

Of the flying snow
Little white-coat rabbits
Almost unseen go.

Dream of coming summer

When the cold has fled.

Deep the sleep they know
In the silver silence
Of the falling snow.

Animals on Higfhways

In one respect long automobile trips
today are not pleasant. The highways
are littered with dead animals and birds,
including skunks, cats, chickens, and oc-
casionally a dog.

Most motorists are humane, and in-
stinctively seek to avoid hitting a furred
or feathered “pedestrian.” But a few of
them are coldly careless, and sometimes
an animal cannot be saved without peril
to humans. So the animal casualties
mount.

Perhaps not much can be done about
it. But motorists can be a little more
cautious, and house-holders might make
a greater effort to keep pets off the
road.

Sleeping'Through the Winter

HENRY NICHOLAS

THERE are animals who can sleep

undisturbed through the long Winter
months. This is one of the great mys—
teries of life. The scientist, as much as
the layman, is puzzled over this strange
phenomenon. Here, it would seem, is a
miracle which nature has provided for
the preservation of those species which
would otherwise perish.

Those animals who have learned how
to obtain food during the winter do not
hibernate. Perhaps, in some long dis-
tant age they were also able to sleep
during those months when the earth
was covered with snow and ice. But
once having learned how to obtain food
they lost the ability to enter that state
of unconsciousness where food was no
longer required.

It is as if nature, willing and ready to
protect her animals as long as they are
ignorant and helpless, decides that when—
ever any species has learned how to
exist by its own efforts then it must
exercise and develop this precious knowl-
edge or perish.

Squirrels store up food during the
seasons when it is plentiful to be drawn
upon during the winter. Bees live on
the honey they have created from the
ﬂowers of the spring and summer. Birds
migrate to sections where food is still
plentiful. Some of these migrations are
mighty journeys over trackless wastes.
The Arctic tern travels from near the
North Pole to near the South Pole, a
journey of about 11,000 miles.

But there are other animals Which
cannot ﬂy and Which have never learned
how to store away a supply of food.
These animals exist during the winter
months by what is called hibernation ——
a strange and dreamless sleep so deep
and motionless that life itself seems to
be suspended. No baby ever slept as
soundly as do these hibernating animals.

Some strange instinct seems to warn
these animals of the approach of winter.

When this mysterious message comes
to them they begin to prepare for their
winter sleep, sometimes as soon as the
ﬁrst days of autumn arrive.

When bears get ready to hibernate
they usually choose a cave or a deep hole
at the base of an old tree. Snakes, like
the copperhead or rattlesnake, usually
select hollow logs or a space under a
fallen tree. Frogs bury themselves for
their winter sleep in the mud beneath
the water.

The soundness of the sleep of these
hibernating animals seems almost un-
believable. A dormouse, once it has
curled up in a hard little ball for its
winter sleep, can be rolled across the
ﬂoor without being aroused from its
deep slumber. A hibernating bat was
submerged in a bucket of water for an
hour, and when taken out was still sleep-
ing peacefully. Alligators have been seen
in Florida, that had been swept out of
their sleeping quarters by a river ﬂood,
ﬂoating like logs downstream towards
the ocean, still sound asleep.

Of all hibernating animals the bat is
the strangest in the manner in which it
takes its winter sleep. While most other
animals lie down and curl up in a com-
fortable position, the bat sleeps while it
hangs head down. It sleeps in this posi-
tion during the winter months, not
moving except when it sways with a
strong wind, until the ﬁrst early days
of spring arrive.

City visitor: Which is correct, “A hen
is sitting,” or “a hen is setting?”

Farmer: I don’t know and I don’t care.
All I bother about is when she cackles —
is she laying or is she lying?

Deer
Willa Hoey

Shy beasts that seek sweet pastures fresh
and new,

When ferns are richly clad a russet hue;

Embodiment of grace, and yet they start—

A falling leaf with terror fills their heart;

Their pleading eyes look up in pain and
fear.

I wonder how a man could shoot a deer.

Wildlife in Captivity

F. J. WORRALL

HERE is no more fascinating story
in our world today than that of
wildlife in its natural environment. Al-
though Nature is constantly changing
and adapting her millions of creatures
to their respective places, an amazing
balance has always been kept. This 'has
been true for centuries.

Left alone, a jungle or forest will re—
main the same as far as wildlife is con-
cerned. Continual war on each other pre-
vents a predominance of type. It is only
when man steps into the scene that the
natural balance is upset and confusion
ensues.

Among themselves, one creature preys
upon the other and at all times each one
must use its wits but Nature has en-
dowed each one with weapons of defense
or offense which are used to the best
possible advantage.

Some of the weaker animals have
safety in slender legs that can gallop
faster than their pursuers; others have
stings, horns, offensive secretions in
their bodies or electric shocks with which
to combat enemies. Others, by means of
protective camouﬂage, warn others of
approaching danger.

Thus, the stick insect resembles the
twigs of a tree on which it carves semi-
circles in the leaves with its powerful
jaws until its appetite is appeased. Thus
also does the hedgehog curl into a prick-
ly ball and the porcupine erect its deadly
spines. The camel lives in the desert
where there is little food or water, so in
times of plenty its humps store fat to
be reservoirs of nourishment for lean
days. The water laid in at the oasis lasts
for the long arid journey ahead. When
ﬂying beneath a blazing sun, the eagle
drops a translucent sheath over its eyes.
The owl is made to see at night.

These are only a few of the interest-
ing habits that show discernment and
power of adjustment among the crea-
tures that love to roam at will under
God’s sun and stars. Since Nature has
devised the proper environment for
every creature, it should be allowed to
remain where it is best equipped to fol-
low .the Creator’s plan, and not man’s
.caprlce.

Wildlife Refuges Pay Dividends

" S‘IGMUND SAMETH

IGURES gleaned from. the United
F States Yearbook show (that today

there are 247 wildlife-refuges in
this country, embracing 13,635,365 acres
of land. What an imposing record of
government conservation effort in four
short years! And the cost to the tax-
payers is almost negligible, for wildlife

 

 

refuges by their very nature require no
more upkeep than a periodic policing.

I Visited one of the new refuges set
up under authority of the Pittman-
Robertson Act of September 2, 1937. A
graveled road led to the administration
building. Inside I met the ofﬁcer in
charge of the refuge, a graduate of two
universities and a senior biologist for
the Fish and Wildlife Service. He greeted
me cordially, for Visitors to a wildlife
refuge are always welcome, provided
they leave their guns behind.

“Isn’t your wildlife refuge, with its
thousands of migratory waterfowl, easy
pickings for poachers?” I asked. The
refuge is several miles across and I had
Visions of unethical local hunters mak-
ing use of parts of it as a shooting
preserve.

The biologist smiled, “No, the poachers
are easy pickings for us. We caught
one just the other day.”

Wildlife refuges are just beginning
to show their beneﬁts. They are check—
ing depletion of our country’s ﬁsh and
game, a valued resource. With natural
food and cover diminishing as land is
appropriated by the farmer and indus-

trialist, wildlife is given a helping hand
by Uncle Sam. The refuges restore a
suitable environment in which birds and
animals live and reproduce naturally to
delight all of us who love the great out-
doors and the creatures who populate it.

One of the most colorful of the
refuges is outside the city of Savannah,
Ga., on a site which was a great rice
plantation in the days before the Civil
War. Using the same system of irriga—
tion drains and ditches the Fish and
Wldlife Service has turned the fertile
rice land towards other crops as well.
Over a dozen seed plants are now grow-
ing and furnishing food for migratory
birds. After the initial seeding little
attention is necessary on the refuge.
New plants volunteer the next year. And
that’s the way things are on a wildlife
refuge. Uncle Sam is letting Nature take
her course.

Brazil Protects Butterﬂies
JULIA EVA FREEMAN

NLY one nation extends the protec-

tion of its laws to shield a butter-
ﬂy. That nation is our great South
American neighbor, Brazil.

A few years ago, the magniﬁcent
Morphos butterﬂy was threatened with
extermination at the hands of commer-
cial interests. Some one had discovered
that its beautiful blue-green, irridescent
wings, arranged under glass, could be
made into pictures and jewelry that
found a ready sale to tourists seeking
novel souvenirs.

Immediately the chase began. Butter-
ﬂy hunters pursued the gorgeous insects
as ruthlessly as though they were dan-
gerous beasts of prey instead of one of
God’s masterpieces.

The hunters ranged the forests of the
Amazon, capturing the insects by thou-
sands, maiming and crippling other
thousands. As a result of this wholesale
slaughter butterﬂies were becoming
alarmingly scarce. Then the government
intervened and passed a law protecting
them. Now they are becoming more
plentiful, and the nature lover and con-
servationist will again see the glint of
their gorgeous wings among the forest
glades.

All honor to the solons of Brazil, who
have been big enough to extend the pro-
tection of her laws to one of the most
helpless of her citizens. They have estab-
lished a precedent which it is hoped
that other nations will adopt.

“Hector” the Hermit

E showed up at our road camp a day

or two after we had established
ourselves at Big Creek in Monterey
County, California. He was lean and
hungry and willing to work for his
bread. He looked to be at least three-
quarters Airedale and we called him
“Hector,” writes “E. C.” in the Christian
Science Monitor.

We were State engineers, sent into the
wilderness to lay a line for the last hun—
dred miles of what is now the Roosevelt
Highway—that difﬁcult stretch from Big
Sur down to San Simeon which took
awhile to conquer.

Hector attached himself to us, scout-
ing daily with the cross-section party,
preceding the swamper into tangled
brush and matted undergrowth that had
never felt the touch of a woodsman’s ax.

Before the ﬁrst day’s work was done
the big Airedale proved his value. Sniff-
ing ahead of the crew as they hewed and
hacked at the bristly thickets of oak and
(Chaparral he warned us effectively
against one of the most constant dangers
we were to encounter in that section——
rattlesnakes.

Here the rocky coast country, barren
of any but the sparest vegetation, was
snake-infested, a worthy rival of Ari-
zona’s famous Rattlesnake Gorge.

We soon learned to trust Hector’s
judgment; to give ample room for com-
bat. We’d see the big dog’s body stiffen.
Then before we could locate the enemy,
Hector would spring. His springs were
invariably accurate.

Without doubt but for the Airedale’s
alertness, many of us would have been
struck as we worked through the scrag-
gly brush up and down cliffs where there

was no trail, where likely we were the
ﬁrst white men to travel.

A pat on the head, a biscuit from the
lunch box, and the faithful fellow would
be off 1n search of another enemy coil.

Perhaps each one was just another thrill
for him.

Back at camp he ate with us. But he
wasn’t at all the ordinary tramp dog, ac-
cepting a meal and disappearing before
another day began. Hector worked and
ate and slept like any other member of
the location party. With certain reser-
vations he even submitted to our clumsy
caresses. He did a man’s work and took

Er granted he was welcome in the out-

. When our work at Big Creek was ﬁn-
ished, our efforts to persuade the half-
Wlld dog to go back to civilization with
us proved futile. Haughtily he refused
a place in the small ﬁshing boat which
came to take us to Monterey. With no
semblance of regret he rejected half a
dozen proffered homes. One of my most
p01gnant recollections of those weeks in

For my initial trip over the new high-
way I hope to choose a still, moonlit
night so that I may listen carefully for
the baying of a lone-some dog off in the
hills from Big Creek. If I’m lucky, I may

Animals Have a Sense of

Humor
M. H. MORGAN

HE ball and doll are the oldest toys

known to man, but their enjoyment
is not conﬁned to humans. Carl Akeley,
noted African explorer and naturalist,
tells of once coming upon an elephant
herd, whose young had gathered in an
open space in the jungle. Here they
were knocking a ball around, composed
of a round piece of ant-hill that had
broken off. Using their trunks as bats,
they were really going to town, and hav-
ing a grand time.

Seals on the Pribilof Islands off the
western coast of Alaska, flipper-cuff a
ball of snow and ice in much the same
way, only using their broad, ﬂat ﬂippers
as bats, and lolloping clumsily to home
base; so it is not such a remarkable feat
after all, that in our zoos, seals can
be taught to “play ball.”

Enos Mills, nature lover and writer,
specialized in a study of the grizzly bear,
and his books form delightful reading.
Grizzlies, he says, sometimes come out of
hibernation for short periods, and he
tells of watching a large one having a
hilarious slide down a long mountain
slope. He skidded down on his hunkers,

breaking his speed with right or left paw
as needed. Mr. Mills became so en-
grossed in the antics of the huge fellow,
climbing the slope time after time in
numerous repeats, slapping his fat legs
in glee, that he lost his own footing, and
followed the bear down the slope, land-
ing on the grizzly’s back in a cloud of
powdery snow. He owed his escape to
the fact that the hear was so surprised
he galloped off without looking back to
see what sort of creature was riding
him. They also, Mr. Mills says, love to
cart—wheel, and use mud slides, as do the
otters, beavers and minks, sometimes
landing on the water in a sit—down strike,
almost laughing aloud in their delight.
He said he never carried a gun, even
among grizzlies, as wild animals sense
the difference between an armed man
and one without a weapon.

Mountain sheep play King of the Cas—
tle and Follow Your Leader; rabbits
engage in Leap Frog on moonlight
nights; squirrels enjoy a game of I Spy
and Catch, scrambling scratchily around
tree trunks, racing over branches, some-
times making six—foot leaps from dizzy
heights.

Dogs contend with each other in a
Tug of War, using a rope, stick or piece
of cloth stretched between them, and
held in their teeth; and squirrels, kit-
tens, puppies and the young of all wild
animals wrestle and box.

We needn’t mention the monkeys,
since their “shines” are too well known,
but surely the humanness of these neigh-
bors in feathers and fur presents its
own appeal to friendly understanding
and a willingness to live and let live.

Nerve us with incessant aﬂ‘irmatives.
Don’t bark against the bad, but chant
the beauties of the good. EMERSON

From “The Tryst of the Years”
(When an Old Year Dies)

The three following and rarely beau-
tiful stanzas are taken from a poem
with the above title—a poem by Mar-
garet M. Halvey, managing editor of
The A-V:

He came to the tryst of the bygone years—
A brother, as they—dethroned,
discrowned—
Hasting where ingrate chimes and cheers
01‘ an ingrate earth might no more
resound; ‘
They marveled not that his eyes were dim—
Those kindred years awaiting him.

For each the self-same tate had known—
At the beck of Time to lay swiftly down
The right of sceptre and might of throne—-
To dotf the jeweled and garnished
crown—
While yet the ermine December spread
Muttled the New Year’s nearing tread.

How gladly they clustered around him there!
How soft they spake! so he might not miss
The faint far echo of sigh and prayer
That followed—sweet as the sealing kiss
The Recording Angel stooped to lay
On the volume, closed that closing day.

An Attractive Folder

An appealing four-page leaﬂet has been
issued by the Holyoke Branch of the
Massachusetts S. P. C. A., setting forth
the aims of the organization. These are
to maintain a Shelter for small animals;
to promote humane education in the pub-
lic and parochial schools; to acquaint the
public with the need for kindness to ani—
mals and our duty to care for them prop—
erly; and to investigate all acts of cruelty.
Nine ways in which animals serve man
are pointed out, and the leaﬂet concludes
with an appeal on ethical grounds for the
support of the work. Memberships are
$1 per year. The Holyoke Shelter is at
14 Railroad Street.

Horseback Riding for Children

S for the boys and girls on farms,

many of them now know the great
delight and beneﬁt there is in horseback
riding, writes Wayne Dinsmore in a
leaﬂet put out by the Horse and Mule
Association of America. But to all too
many, in this age of mechanical trans-
portation, young people think of horses
only in terms of work. Those who have
experienced the keen joy of brisk horse—
back rides over country roads, through
the woods, and across ﬁelds, well know
that this form of sport and exercise
affords the most genuine satisfaction.

Horseback riding has wonderful val-
ues in the development of character. It
teaches self-control, self-reliance, self-
conﬁdence. It develops courage and
quick-thinking. It trains the correla—
tion of mind and muscle and increases
the alertness of eye and brain.

A good horseback rider is ready for
emergencies, prepared for instant de-
cisions. In short, there is no better de-
veloper of true manhood, no better exer—
cise, no greater outdoor enjoyment and
no more practical way of doing many a
chore and covering the miles every
farmer and farm boy has to travel, than
horseback riding.

M.S.P.C.A. Poster Contest

Commissioner of Education for the
Commonwealth, Walter F. Downey, on
paying an ofﬁcial visit to the exhibition
of our school posters at Jordan’s, said,
“This is not only one of the ﬁnest dis-
plays of posters I have ever Viewed, but
this type of art work in our schools rep—
resents one of the surest means of bring—
ing Humane Education — thoughts of
kindness — to the attention of thousands
of children (and their parents) who en-
ter the contest. I hope your Society will
never cease sponsoring these contests.”

Our Work in Ireland

ITS need just now. No coal, no fertili-
zers are coming in to Ireland at pres-
ent. Peat for fuel is being transported
by little donkeys to the limit of their
strength, and seaweeds from many places
are being brought to enrich the soil in—
stead of the usual fertilizers once avail-
able.

The above picture is from our repre-
sentative, Michael O’Connor in Ireland,
who is traveling about and doing all in
his power to protect the donkeys and
ponies from too much overwork and from
lack of proper care. We send him only
a few dollars annually from a special
fund for such purposes, but he makes
it all count. The Dublin Society vouches
for his ﬁdelity and loyal service.

Mrs. Weathersbee Honored

At a recent meeting of the Council of
the Fulton County Parent Teacher Asso-
ciation, in Atlanta, Georgia, Mrs. Kath-
erine Weathersbee, ﬁeld worker of the
American Humane Education Society
and chairman of humane education for
the Georgia Congress, P. T. A., was sur-
prise-d by a presentation of a certiﬁcate
of life membership in the Georgia Con-
gress from friends who wished to ex-
press their appreciation of her outstand-
ing work in the cause. Mrs. Weathers-
bee, with other life members, was also
honored with a banquet at the state
meeting in Gainsville the following week.

Endowed stalls and kennels are needed
in the Angell Memorial Animal Hospital.
Payments of thirty-ﬁve dollars for a
kennel or seventy-ﬁve dollars for a stall
will insure a suitable marker inscribed
with donor’s name. Terms of permanent
endowment of free stalls and kennels
will be given upon application to the
Treasurer, 180 Longwood Avenue, Boston.

The Alley Cat

Susie Montgomery Best

He's just an alley kitten;
He has no pedigree,

But he’s slick and roly-poly,
And as cute as he can be.

I rescued him from trouble.
He was a tiny thing,

But he's become tremendous
And acts quite like a king.

He’s entered in the "Cat Show";
He may not be so ”rare,"

But I think he's as important
As the furriest pussy there.

He scorns the fluffy “Persian,”_
He eyes the tailless "Manx,"
He peeps at the "Angora"
Whose hair hangs down in hanks.

He flouts the proud ”Chinchilla,"
And the short-haired Siamese.

Perhaps he sometimes wonders
Why he is not like these.

I’m sure, though, he could down them
In any feline spats,

For after all it’s certain
That they are only cats.

The Cattle and the Berries

A few years ago I spent my August
vacation in the pretty village of North
Sutton, in New Hampshire. One day a
little party of us went to the summit of
Mt. Kearsarge after blueberries. As we
passed through some ﬁelds about half—
way up the mountain, several cattle fol-
lowed us. “Why do the cattle follow us?”
said 1. One of our party answered, “they
see our pails, and they want salt.” “Well,
why don’t we bring them some salt?”

We went on to the top of the moun—
tain. The lumbermen had cut off the
woods. The sun had then shone on the
earth and warmed it; and the blueberry
seeds waiting in the earth had said
“Now’s our time!” Oh, but weren’t the
berries thick!

Well, the next day I found at the gro-
cery store that for a few pennies I could
get all the salt I wanted. So on our
next trip up the mountain we took a bag
of salt, and emptied it into a wooden
box which probably had been left by the
lumbermen.

One more visit to the mountain after
a few days. The box is all broken to
pieces, and every last particle of salt that
could hide in any of its corners is gone!

We could almost hear the cattle say
“Thank you.”

The Mystery of the Cat

CHARLOTTE C.

ITH the world in chaos and our
W own lives disrupted, it seems a

far cry to ponder on the mys—
terious behavior of the domestic cat. At-
tention has been focused on the feline
domestica in war torn London particu-
larly, because of its extraordinary ac-
tions under extreme difﬁculties. Many
stories are being recounted of the seem-
ingly occult knowledge of the ordinary
cat; by those huddled together in under-
ground shelters; those thrown out of
their homes on the mercy of their fel—
lows, separated from their loved ones,
but reclaimed by their cats.

In normal times, the average person
saw that the household cat had its liver,
its milk, was put out at night, and—
let it go at that. It has taken a horriﬁc
world cataclysm to bring to the fore,
the strange powers possessed by even
the common alley cat.

Those of us who have been sufﬁciently
interested in the behavior of cats, have
been rewarded by a wealth of data which
challenges one’s imagination. However,
strange as it may appear, the languorous
feline has ever been a source of inspira-
tion to poet and literateur. No animal
in history is so honored. From time im-
memorial the cat has been silently in-
gratiating and amazingly intriguing.

So bewildering has been the conduct
of the feline throughout the ages, that
savants have devoted a good deal of time
to investigating the pedigree of the
cat in order to reach some explanation
of its mysterious powers. However, the
origin of the cat is
hidden in remotest
antiquity.

Our earliest knowl-
edge of this extraor-
dinary animal is
gleaned from an-
cient Egyptian civi-

lization. From an-
cient, for a high
degree of culture

prevailed in the re-
mote times of the
Pharaohs. At the
height of Egyptian
power animals were
considered as being
the incarnate form
of a group of gods,
the predecessors of
the Egyptians in
Egypt, and ordained
to dwell in the after-
world where every
Egyptian hoped to
go after death.
The cult of the
feline ﬂourished in
the ancient empire.

 

WEST, M.D.

The Egyptians’ knowledge of embalm-
ing and their reverence for the cat,
enabled them to preserve these animals
for centuries. They possessed several
methods of embalming and only the most
highly developed has endured in the
bodies of the mighty to the present day.
So greatly was the cat worshipped that
this honor, denied the ordinary human
being, was granted the feline. We have
many mummied specimens, their bodies
swathed, bandaged and spiced in most
exquisite manner, thus having had be-
stowed upon them the temporary immor-
tality of a Rameses or a Pharaoh.

What are the qualities which make the
cat of surpassing interest to man in
general and to gifted literati in particu-
lar? Hereward Carrington, interna—
tionally known authority on psychic re—
search, in a lecture on “The Psychic
Life,” given some years ago, alluded to
the immeasurable loss to mankind if, in
consequence of the devastating inroads
of the airplane, land cruiser, and what-
not, the telepathic and other unseen
means of communication engaged in by
savages and wild animals should be
completely extinguished before we are
able to capture and study them.

Although cats have been domesticated
for thousands of years, they retain the
chief characteristic of their ancient
tribe. It is generally conceded by those
who have delved into the subject, that
of all creatures, cats are possessed to an
unbelievable degree of the quality
termed prescience.

tions showed no signs of advancing age,
and was apparently still full of ﬂight.”

Dr. Worth is secretary of the Eastern
Bird Banding Association, a group of
men and women who band birds as a
hobby. There are four such organiza—
tions in the United States and Canada,
each operating in its geographical sec—
tion. Hundreds of men and women,
young as well as old, ﬁnd pleasure and
satisfaction in trapping all kinds of mi-
gratory birds, slipping the numbered
bands over their legs, and then releasing
them unharmed.

They ﬁnd pleasure in the work be—
cause they like birds and wish to know
more about them; and satisfaction be—
cause they know that the records they
keep are of great importance to the Fed-
eral Bureau of Biological Survey in trac-
ing migration routes and in learning
about nesting habits, foods, diseases,
and parasites. '

One must secure a special license from
the Federal Government before indulg-
ing in this hobby. Little numbered metal
rings, of different sizes for the different
kinds of birds, are secured from the
Bureau, and records and reports must be
submitted at stated intervals. In a spe—
cial room in Washington, D. C., are kept
the records on cards, literally millions
of them. From all over North America
and for a long period of years the
records have been gathered and carefully
tabulated.

Many bird-banders have special inter-
ests in the feathered creatures. Some
check food and nesting habits; others
record weights and measurements. Many
search for parasites or note the dis—
eases that afflict our songsters. Ailing
and dead birds are sent for study to re-
search centers where scientists who
specialize on diseases and internal para-
sites investigate the cause of death. In
this way a great mass of extremely im-
portant data on bird life is being accu—
mulated.

Each year the different regional as-
sociations have annual meetings which
are attended by large numbers of en-
thusiastic bird-banders. Observations on
bird habits are exchanged, improved
methods of trapping and handling to
prevent injury to the fragile creatures
are discussed, and reports on special pro-
Jects made.

Most of the bird-banding enthusiasts
are not professional students of bird
lore. They do the work for the love of
it, and because they know that the more
1nformation we can gain about our song-
sters, the better we appreciate them, and

the surer we are to provide. for their
needs.

Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals when making your will.

The Whippoorwill Is Calling

ERY few are the birds who can

identify themselves so distinctly as
the whippoorwill, whose nocturnal notes
resound when all is still. The great
ornithologist, Alexander Wilson, de—
scribes him as belonging to a “singular
and very celebrated species, universally
noted over the greater part of the United
States for the loud reiterations of his
favorite call in spring.” He is not to be
confused with the nighthawk though
much resembling him in form and col-
oration. The whippoorwills consume
great quantities of night-ﬂying insects,
and are among our most useful birds.

The Saucy Canary

EVELYN F. HAMILTON

An acquaintance of the writer had a
canary of which she was very fond.
When at home she gave him the run of
the house, always returning him to his
cage before she went out. One day she
was hurriedly called to town, in response
to a phone call from a friend. When
she was ready to leave, she looked all
through the house to ﬁnd “Dicky,” usu-
ally perched on a picture frame when
out of his cage, but her search was fu-
tile. As her errand was urgent she could
delay no longer. So she hurried away,
worried, of course, over the bird.

On the street car she was much em-
barrassed by passengers staring at her;
but could not account for it. When she
left the street car and proceeded to walk
several blocks to the apartment of her
friend she was again disquieted over
pedestrians staring at her, some follow-
ing her. On arriving at her friend’s
home the reason was made plain. On
opening the door to greet her, the latter
uttered an exclamation of surprise.
Perched on the front of the lady’s hat,
saucy as you please, was Dicky. There
he had been ever since his mistress left
her home.

The Nightingale
Salvatore Marsiglia

I took my pen to write a poem
On all the loveliness of spring;

But from the tree outside my room
I heard the sound of music ring.

And, oh! how mournful, too, it seemed,
And soft, as though from out, afar.
”The nightingale," I whispered law,

”Is making music to a star!"

I listened raptured and enthralled,
Dispersed, the thoughts of budding trees;
For here were notes that watted on
The ghostly fingers of the breeze.

And, too, were gone the fragrances
Of buds and blossoms in the night;
Too rare the golden melodies

To charm and gladden and delight.

The nightingale! The nightingale!
Elusive bird of heaven’s choice!

I shall take heart from thy fair song
And with thy presence shall rejoice.

“Visitors Resting”
J A C K K Y T L E

AT a small Alabama lumber mill, the
sign was lettered with red crayon
upon a strip of cardboard. It said sim-
ply, “Don’t Dis-turb—Visitors Resting.”
Perhaps my curiosity was overly evi-
dent, for such a sign seemed out of place
amid the raucous noise of saws and the
thuds of heavy boards. The tall, broad-
shouldered man who had been feeding
lumber into the planer walked over to
where I was standing.

He laughed a little, saying, “That’s
for our pets. We had them here last
year, and now they’re back.”

I nodded, still looking at the sign, and
he went on, “They’re robins. They have
a nest up there back of that four-by-
eight piece of timber. It’s a safe, com-
fortable place.”

“It’s a ﬁne thought,” I said, “looking
after them this way.”

He was thoughtful for a moment, kick-
ing slowly at a small heap of sawdust.
Then he replied, “We sort of owe it to
them, you see. Last year, before we
knew they were up there, we had an ac-
cident. One of the men scared them un-
knowingly and, in the excitement, a
couple of eggs were broken. He put the
sign up. He was sorry for what he had
causedB’

Only a strip of cardboard, crudely let-
tered, and tacked up under a robin’s
nest. But the thought of it and of the
hard—working men who respected it
lifted my feelings immeasurably.

Kindness and compassion to all living
things is the noblest code of ethics.

Two more lynchings in the South. The
one at Sikeston, Missouri, was as shock-
ing in its cruelty as any deed of bar-
barism of which Japanese or Nazis have
been guilty. Are we as a nation being
judged by deeds like these?

“When I am on my way to dine with
a friend,” said the famous Dr. Samuel
Johnson, “and ﬁnding I am late, if I
happen to attend when he whips his
horse, I may feel unpleasantly that the
animal is put to pain, but I do not wish
him to desist. No sir, I wish him to
drive on.” The celebrated scholar, lexi-
cographer and philosopher should have
lived in the days of the automobile.

We wonder whether the new taxes,
reaching now down to multitudes never
before compelled to pay a tax, except
indirectly, will lessen the hundreds of
thousands of dollars gambled away at
the dog and horse race tracks here in
Massachusetts. It seems rather strange
that dog racing and its betting privi-
leges should be denied by law to the
citizens of California, as is told in an-
other column, and permitted in what
was once old Puritan Massachusetts.

All foreign armies except the English
use animals in great numbers. From
the most trustworthy sources available,
it appears that the Russian army has
more than 1,000,000 animals; the Japa-
nese army has more than 375,000, and
the German army include-s, as a con-
servative estimate, more than 960,000
animals. The American army has
50,000.

Easter Chicks

ACH year at Easter time, thousands
of children receive as presents baby

chicks or baby rabbits. In spite .of the
fact that many states and cities have
enacted legislation prohibiting the sale
of these animals,
purposes, careless
indifferent stores
this practice.

While we admit that the animals are
“cute” and lovable, we nevertheless can-
not understand why otherwise sensible
parents can permit the unfortunate
creatures to be mauled and tortured by
innocent hands not knowing any better.
If parents could only visit Societies for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals a
week or so after Easter and see for
themselves the many chicks and bunnies
with broken bones and other injuries,
they would then be able to judge the
issue fairly.

Give the children inanimate articles
for Easter and let the animals live the
normal lives they are entitled to.

From Albert Payson Terhune

Albert Payson Terhune, noted dog
breeder and author, whose death was
recently announced, paid high tribute
to the Springﬁeld Branch of the Angel]
Memorial Hospital upon the occasion of
a visit to Springﬁeld, where he lived in
early youth:

“For nearly ﬁfty years I have been
a booster for Springﬁeld. I have told
people around the world of its excellent
school and park systems, and one of the
ﬁnest of many great things that have
come to the city in recent years is the
Animal Hospital on Bliss Street where,
as a boy, I used to play.”

Dog Racing

HEN Attorney General Earl War-

ren took ofﬁce in California, he
wasted little time in giving the dog
tracks notice that if their operations
were not legalized by the State Legis-
lature, he would close every one of them.
They were not legalized and Mr. Warren
was as good as his word. That was in
1939, and California has not had dog
racing since that time.

The January, 1942, issue of the San
Francisco S. P. C. A.’s delightful pub-
lication, Om" Animals, has an interesting
article on dog racing, in which Editor
Charles W. Friedrichs has this to say:

“Probably the greatest cruelties prac-
tised in connection with dog racing have

, been the methods of training the dogs.

Live rabbits and even cats have been
used for this purpose. Outstanding
among the cruel methods employed is
that where live animals, usually white
rabbit-s, are attached or fastened to the
arm of a training machine and the ma—
chine propelled around a track for the
racing dogs to pursue. This form of
cruelty was prohibited in California in
1935.”

Massachusetts and other states which
permit dog racing would do well if they
followed the leadership of California.
The Governors of many other states,
including New York, have refused to
sign bills legalizing dog—track operations.

The twenty-eighth annual Humane
Sunday and Be Kind to Animals Week
will be observed throughout the country
this year on April 19 and April 20—25,
respectively. Scattered through the
pages of this issue will be found an-
nouncements of importance in connec-
tion with these events.

A New Year’s Wish

GUY'RICHARDSON

I wish for all the dogs that live

The kindest master's earth can give,
And space to freely run and leap,
And kennels neat in which to sleep.

I wish for all the cats around

That trite affection may abound,
With comforts such as kittens seek,
In cozy nooks from which to peek;

And, round the ﬁreside’s ruddy glow,
May dog and cat the pleasures know

Of homes where love still reigns supreme,
As man and beast together dream!

Flicker Isn’t Fussy
D o R I s «G A L E

E sure to pad all your furniture carefully, if you
B ever take a ﬂicker in to live with you! Not a bit
fussy, this big, stumpy member of the woodpecker fam-
ily will just hammer away at your table and chairs as if
they were his favorite trees. And, remember, he can
strike the wood at the rate of six hundred pecks a minute!

The ﬂicker is the famous member of the woodpecker
family, easily recognized. He’s the one out of all who
likes to walk about on the ground. He’s the one with the
large white spot on the lower part of his back. He has
the usual woodpecker-tail, short and stiff, by which he
braces himself while he knocks against a tree trunk. He
likes to eat larvae and wild berries; and if there is plenty
of food in your neighborhood you’ll probably see him
around all winter and summer.

The ﬂicker isn’t the fussy type at all. He’s a ﬁne
father, and takes his turn in sitting on the eggs to relieve
the mother. The hole bored in a tree, where the ﬂickers
live, is pecked out by both the mother and father, shar-
ing the work. This home doesn’t appear very attractive,
since it hasn’t a bit of greenery in it, but the baby birds
love it so that the parents often have to coax for many
days, when they believe the young ones are strong
enough, to convince them to start out on their own!

You may call him golden-winged woodpecker, yellow
hammer, yucker, clape, high-hole, pigeon woodpecker, or
one of his many other nicknames, but this brown and
black bird with the red bar on the back of his neck, and
the white patch on his back is a ﬁne and good-natured
friend, always.

No Gasoline Problem for Them

LeROY E.FESS

HEN Uncle Sam asked for a reduction in the con-

sumption of gasoline in the East, Theodore P.
Elbers of Clarence, N. Y., was one of the ﬁrst to comply.
No more of those customary after-dinner rides for the
wife and kids. Mrs. Elbers accepted the edict with good
grace, but not so, Joe, six, and Pats, ﬁve. Finally, Mr.
Elbers devised a way out. “Billy,” whose chief function
in life to that time had been in the role of neighborhood
animated “lawn mower,” was pressed into service. The
Elbers children say their “gasless” carriage may not be
as fast as their daddy’s automobile, but it’s a lot more
thrilling, especially when Billy slips into high on the
home stretch.

Algernon Blackwood in one of his
weirdly grotesque stories of the occult,
describes the strange conduct of a cat,
“Smoke,” of which he says, “All its
forces ran to intelligence—secret intelli-
gence—the wordless, incalculable intui-
tion of the cat.” He then goes on to
state that animals are more often and
more truly clairvoyant than human be-
ings. Many of them, he felt convinced,
possessed powers of perception far su—
perior to that mere keenness of the
senses common to all dwellers in the
wilds, where the senses grow specially
alert; they had what he termed “animal
clairvoyance.” “Cats in particular were
almost continuously conscious of a larger
ﬁeld of vision, too detailed even for a
photographic camera, and quite beyond
the reach of normal human organs,” he
adds.

The “Seeing Eye” Birds
F R E D F R 1 s c H

VERY morning it was my pleasure

to feed a ﬂock of sparrows that vis-
ited the ledge that protruded from my
bedroom window. Taking the place of
my alarm clock these feathered visitors
made my arising a real treat. We struck
up a fair bargain. A supply of bread
crumbs, suet, and grit was always on
hand near the wind-ow. I never forgot
my tiny friends and they never let me
oversleep. Throughout summer, fall,
spring and winter they came and chirped
their happy little songs.

One morning I noticed a slightly
larger bird among the sparrows eating
my offerings. It was a starling. I an—
ticipated a large addition of starlings to
my early morning Visitors. Each morn-
ing the starling returned with the spar—
rows but no other starlings appeared.
The larger bird always arrived with sev—
eral of the sparrows and left when they
did. Perhaps he was an outcast from
his own species.

I watched closely for many days be-
fore I discovered the truth behind the
starling’s visits. The bird was nearly
blind and the tiny sparrows were guiding
him to the ledge to eat. It was an amaz-
ing revelation. The sparrows were act—
ing in the same manner as the “seeing
eye” dogs do for the blind people.

For several months the sparrows led
their blind ward to my window, and then
one day he did not appear. I watched
in vain for many days but he never re—
turned. What happened to my unseeing
friend I never will know. Somewhere in
the Valhalla of winged creatures he is
waiting to greet his many friends who
cared for him during his trying days.

Humaneness as a governing principle
of 11fe lS essential to true civilization.

The Great White Gannet

W. J.

 

ISLAND

T is a sad commentary on the ways
][ of man that a bird which won’t hurry

to get out of his way earns a reputa-
tion for stupidity. The brown gannet of
southern waters owes his uncomplimen-
tary nickname, “booby,” largely to the
fact that he doesn’t seem to realize his
peril in the approach of human in—
truders. The great white gannet (Sula
bassana), still found in a few nesting
places on the rocks of the Gulf of St.
Lawrence and Newfoundland, is also
hard to chase.

Perhaps fortunately for the survival
of the species, the nests of seaweed and
guano, containing a single chalky egg,
perch in populous colonies on inacces-
sible rock faces. The approach for a pic-
ture like this one on Bonaventure Island
near Gaspe’s famed Perce Rock, requires
a good deal of climbing, including a
descent from the cliff top at the end of
a rope. Furthermore, the gannet is lack-
ing in commercial value. Even so, the
once vast rookeries of the Gulf Region
were so reduced some forty years ago
that government measures had to be tak-
en to save the species from possible eX—
tinction. Remaining nesting-places have
increased in bird population, some 14,000
gannets as well as numerous other deni-
zens of northern sea and sky spending
the season on Bonaventure.

As bulky as a goose, the gannet is
more closely related to the cormorant
and rivals the latter in prowess as a
ﬁsherman. The gannets like to ﬂy in
single ﬁle above a school of ﬁsh, and then
one after another they plummet from a

WHITE GANNETS ON BONAVENTURE

BANKS

height of forty feet or more,
sending up a mighty spray and
disappearing far below the sur-
face. Some say that the gannets
cannot ﬁsh in very calm weather,
since the heavy birds are unable
to “take off” from the surface
again without the aid of a “tail
wind.” As the ﬁsh migrate
southward in the fall the gan—
nets follow them. In mild win—
ters some have been seen in the
vicinity of Cape God but most
of them head for more southerly
climes like the Gulf of Mexico
and Cuba.

The immature bird, when it
leaves the nest, appears heavier
than the adult, presumably car—
rying enough fat to last through
the lean days before it can feed
itself. Still unable to ﬂy, it ﬂut-
ters and ﬂaps its way down the
cliff to the surface of the sea.
Once hunted down because of
their supposed destruction of
the ﬁsheries it is doubtful if the
gannets really make much im-
pression upon the vast shoals of herring
and other commercial ﬁsh.

The yellow warbler is one bird that
won’t be victimized by the cowbird.
When the warbler ﬁnds a strange egg
in its cup-shaped nest it proceeds to
weave a new bottom thereby sealing up
the cowbird’s egg and preventing it from
hatching out. Even when the warbler
has already laid her eggs and then ﬁnds
another not her own in the nest she will
sacriﬁce all and weave another nest bot—
tom to defeat the interloper Who would
try to starve her own brood.

Humane Week in Tacoma

Largely due to the untiring efforts of
Mrs. Florida L. Byrne, representing the
American Humane Education Society,
press, radio and school united in a sig-
niﬁcant observation of Humane Week in
Tacoma, Washington. Superintendent
Howard R. Gould, in an ofﬁcial bulletin,
asked teachers to mark the celebration
with appropriate exercises, and called
attention to the plays put out by the
Humane Education Society. Several
plays were staged before P. T. A. gather-
ings by school children and Girl Scouts.
All three radio stations carried programs
of plays or addresses by Mrs. Byrne and
Mrs. C. J. Lyonnais. Feature articles
and generous announcements appeared
in the newspapers.

Cruelty, above all else, hampers the
spiritual progress of mankind.

OUR ‘DUMB ANIMALS

Mme. von Corbelar’s Work
in Hungary
EADERS of Our Dumb Animals have
known for a long time of the de-
voted, self—sacriﬁcing work of Mme.
Camilla von Corbelar who, alone and sin—
gle-handed, has been ﬁghting a hard bat-
tle in the interests of unfortunate ani-
mals in Hungary.

Recently a woman who had been her
assistant was found to be wholly un-
worthy of the position, and has circulated
reports tending to damage seriously
Mme. von Corbelar’s work and malign
her character. We have just received
from Dr. Burger Bela of Szeged, Hun-
gary, the following letter:

“We lawyers of the Szeged Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
therewith declare and witness that Mrs.
Magdalena Plesko, late ward of the Ani-
mals’ Shelter, who has been dismissed
for many crimes, for neglect and cruelty
to animals trusted to her care, and inso-
lence to the president, is accused by the
public prosecutor under number Ku.
14421/1941, for forging, cheating and
defraudment. She also will be denounced
for calumny committed out of revenge
against our president, Mme. Camilla von
Corbelar. We follow our president’s suit
for a certiﬁcate declaring her independ-
ence from any Society as Humane Wor-
ker and your trustee.”

This letter has been sent us to set at
rest the minds of all in this country who
have generously helped Mme. von Cor.-
belar in her work. It was feared that
this woman, discharged from Mme. von
Corbelar’s Society, might write Ameri-
can contributors trying to persuade
them no longer to continue to maintain
the Shelter and its work in Hungary.

Report from Bible Lands

Our representative in humane educa-
tion work in Syria, Lebanon, Palestine
and Transjordan, Mr. N. B. Matta,
writes us his report for May which did
not reach us until the ﬁrst of December.

He says, “Many of our friends every-
where in this country wandered through
the Villages and towns and took care of
the stray horses and mules and turned
them over to the British forces. And
what pleased me much is the informa-
tion of our friends that the British sol-
diers who cared for animals during the
time of war were most considerate and
kind.

“Reports from the teachers are com-
ing in at the end of every month and
some of them are excellent.

“I and two of my friends made a
preaching tour through Palestine, Syria
and Lebanon. Some three thousand peo-
ple heard the gospel of human kindness.
Six Bands of Mercy were organized in
summer schools.

Jan.1942

“Animals taken care of here and in
Palestine were 27 dogs, 20,. donkeys, 16
horses, 16 mules, 8 cats, 4 rabbits and
1 pig. Animals humanely put to sleep:
6 horses, 4 mules, and 13 dogs. Lost
animals restored to their owners: 7
horses, 7 cows and 2 donkeys.

“There is great poverty here among
the people, especially among the farmers,
due to the very high price of all grain.”

This certainly is ﬁne work that is be-
ing done by these devoted representa-
tives of our American Humane Edu-
cation Society in the Far East.

Humane Thought for Parents
HENRY H. GRAHAM

E who love animals and have their
welfare at heart agree that chil-
dren should be taught, as early in life as
possible, to admire and protect dumb
creatures of all kinds. Even before a
child is old enough to have a ﬂesh and
blood puppy or kitten it is a good idea
to present him with a toy pet, such as a
dog, cat or teddy bear. A stuffed bear
made of cloth has started many a young-
ster on the road to a lifetime of love for
animals, thus enriching his own life and
giving animals a happier existence, too.
Some years ago I knew a little boy
who was given a toy bear. He worshipped
the creature, taking it to bed at night
with him. About the same time he was
given a toy dog. He worshipped the dog,
too. Before long he began to notice live
animals and to play with them and treat
them kindly. Often I saw him carry a
hungry and abandoned cat to his back
door, saying, “Mumsy, can I give this
poor fellow some bread and milk?” His
mother was kind to animals, too. Not
only did she feed the stray animal all he
could hold but she went farther than
that. She and the little boy provided a
home for the homeless wanderer until a
permanent abiding place could be found.
Jimmy, the boy who grew up loving
animals and birds, turned out to be a
ﬁne young man, as is usually the case
with a youngster who develops a liking
for furred and feathered creatures. The
boy who dislikes animals is to be pitied,
for it is clear that there is something
wrong with him. There is usually some-
thing radically wrong with the training
of such children.
How much better it is to give a child
a toy bear or puppy to love and admire
than to give him a toy soldier, army
tank or bombing plane!

“Lizzie”
CARRIE BEHRMAN

T the 1941 Chrysanthemum Show
held in the Garﬁeld Park Conserva-
tory at Chicago a new Chrysanthemum
stood out from all the rest and attracted
much attention from the visitors. Not
that it was an unusual or rare variety,
not that it was beautifully colored, but
because it was called “Lizzie.”

Who was being thus honored by hav-
ing her simple name given to a new cre-
ation in the ﬂower world? Merely a cat——
a common, white and yellow alley cat that
had come to the conservatory twenty-
eight years ago and is still the feline mis—
tress of the place, strong and active.

“Is she a good mouser?” we asked an
attendant.

“It hasn’t been necessary for Lizzie to
do much scouting around,” he said. “She
is too well-fed for that, the pet of the
working staff and the public as well.”

During these many years the former
alley cat has reproduced her kind in great
numbers. Much publicity is given Lizzie
and her numerous offspring in the daily
press of Chicago.

When delegates were preparing the
delphinium show held at the Conserva-
tory last summer, Lizzie, sway-backed
and bedraggled, with several kittens, was
on duty. The kittens frolicked with the
ﬂower workers and upset the dignity of
business meetings. One speaker picked
up a wee mite, cuddling it in his arms as
he related his experiences in growing
delphinium.

The new Chrysanthemum, “Lizzie,” a
nondescript, ragged-looking plant with
small, single ﬂowers of a yellowish hue
was placed amidst the autumnal splendor
of the glorious Chrysanthemums in the
display. Like its aristocratic neighbors
it, too, bore a card with a name. Stuck in
the soil was a placard giving the history
of the cat, Lizzie, to all who might stop
and read.

Though lowly of birth and ordinary in
appearance, environment and similar
characteristics have brought fame to the
cat and to the chrysanthemum.

The Cat’s Soliloquy

“I sit in the window for hours watch-
ing humans rushing past and pitying
them because they feel they must hurry
to get a living, when all I do is purr and
I get everything I want.

“I think serenity is the secret of a long

life—next to a kind mistress and a good
home.”

Far-Famed Cats

WINIFRED HEATH

HE was ‘for the Egyptians, the
Maou, the sacred Cat who had her
own temple at Bubastis, dedicated to

the Goddess of the Moon. For a while she
became the despised cat in the land along
the Nile “as hateful to the god Ra as the
ignominious rat.” Just why she suffered
such a change in popular favor we do not
know. Later she became the interna-
tional cat and it is probable that some
member of her family came to the United
States on the Mayﬂower, or perhaps some
less aristocratic vessel in later days.

In spite of her high ancestry the cat is
a cosmopolite, able to reach social depths
and heights. For a time she was the
boon companion of the witch; whence
she hied her to a nunnery and became
forever linked with the spinster. From
the quiet of the convent she went to court,
the pampered favorite of certain high
dignitaries of the church.

Cardinal Woolsey kept a bevy of feline
beauties who accompanied him every—
where. The stately Richelieu had a whole
train of splendid, be-ribboned cats of
high degree who even stayed with him on
State occasions, much. to the annoyance
of certain courtiers who disliked cats.
Joachim du Bellay, poetical and some-
what melancholy prelate, wrote a 200-
line tribute to his courageous, gentle cat
“Belaud.” The genial sage, Montaigne,

had a pet cat and whimsically remarked
that when he played with her he was
never quite sure whether he was amusing
the cat or she was doing her polite best
to amuse him.

 

In later days a certain Scotchman be-
came a citizen of Paris and wrote a book
on cats which gained him an entry into
the French Academy, much to the dis—
comﬁture of certain authors whose works
had not been so signally honored,
although dealing with much weightier
thlemes.

In England the cat is found every-
where. It has also moved in high liter-
ary circles. In early days her worth was
rated according to her mousing abilities;
and of late years the government cat has
become quite an institution. Bills have
even been passed in Parliament regu-
lating the amount of her daily rations.
There was even an argument between the
two Houses and there was a threat of re-
ducing her fare, but the cat won out and
continued to receive her former rations.
Johnson’s cat “Hodge” was famous in
its time and was a very aristocratic crea-
ture who eschewed the vulgar “bloater”
and developed a passion for oysters.
Charles Dickens had a little deaf cat
known to everyone as “the Master’s Cat,”
who followed him everywhere and when
she craved attention would snuff his
candle with her paw.

Unlike the dog, the outline of the cat

’ has suffered no horrid changes; although

from the alley cat to the splendid
Angora or Persian, there is an inﬁnite
variety of cat—but there are no toy cats
and no huge cats with heavy jowls.
Certainly no other creature can so ad—
mirably express herself; leaving no doubt
whatever as to her feelings. She can ex-
press derision with a twirl of
her tail; rage with her arched
back; scorn and contempt with
a hiss and a spit; and the
purest poetry of content with
her ineffably comforting purr.

From an S. P. C. A.

President

Charlotte D. Wilbur, presi-
dent of the S. P. C. A. in
Princeton, New Jersey, writes
in February:

“I am enclosing one dollar
for renewal of my subscription
to your paper. I could not do
without it. The articles are
always most interesting, and
the photographs and illustra-
tions are beautiful. I know of
no other paper of its size that
presents a more attractive ap-
pearance. Were it taken and
read by more adults many of
the abuses now unnoticed and
permitted by them would be
eliminated.”

Lincoln’s Salute to a Horse

WAS riding “my” horse when I caught my ﬁrst

glimpse of President Lincoln. Accompanied by Mrs.
Lincoln, he was driving in his carriage to his temporary
residence, the Soldiers’ Home, writes Johnson Brigham,
former state librarian of Iowa. It was in the summer of
1864. I had been promoted from hallboy in the central
office. of the Sanitary Commission to be the chief clerk’s
ﬁrst assistant, and one of the perquisites of the position
happened to be the privilege of riding the chief clerk’s
horse—a coal-black stallion with a running record on the
Long Island course. Many regarded the horse as the most
beautiful horse in the District, and I, at least, knew him
to be one of the fastest.

One evening, as I was passing the President’s carriage,
I was quick to notice that the man who sat leaning for—
ward with his elbows upon his knees was the President
himself. He was quite as quick to notice the points of
the horse I rode, and, out of respect for the noble animal,
he waved his hand and bowed to the young rid-er. After
that informal introduction, he was wont to watch the
stallion as he pranced or ﬂew past the carriage, and he
never omitted the salute—which I rightly interpreted as
a mark of respect for the handsomest horse in the
District. I afterward learned that the position in which
I ﬁrst saw him—his elbows on his knees and his hands
supporting his head—had become habitual. The break in
his physical strength had already begun.

Safe for the Rest of Her Life

E. L. VAN DYKE

ES, unless she foolishly runs away, this may be

said of “Libby,” pet fawn doe whose sleek beauty
won many admirers in Chemung County, New York State,
during the past summer.

Libby was found near Ithaca—a helpless baby which
had strayed from her mother. New York State Game
Warden Harold Powers found her a refuge on the sum-
mer farm home of J. Bertram Comstock, of Elmira,
where Mr. Comstock’s 12-year~old son, Michael, took the

little animal in charge.

Portrait
HELEN HASTINGS

Once we had two collie pups,
Small and round and bad.
The way they wrecked the household was

I ndubitably sad.

And since each mischief once achieved
Was perpetrated double,

In recognition of their art

We called them “Sin” and “Trouble.”

But now their puppy days are through,

So digniﬁed they’ve got
We have, in sheer acknowledgment,

To call them “Rex” and “Spot.”

Humane Calendar for 1942

AST year many persons were disap-

pointed not to be able to secure a
copy of the Humane Calendar because
the limited edition had been entirely
sold out.

NOW is the time to send for the new
Calendar for 1942 in order to be sure of
receiving it. After the present supply is
exhausted no more copies will be avail-
able. Those who have seen it are en-
thusiastic in their praise of its remark-
able colored picture, 71/2x10 inches, show-
ing George Washington, Patrick Henry
and Edmund Pendleton, mounted on
splendid horses, riding away from Mount
Vernon to attend the First Continental
Congress at Philadelphia. It is a scene
of great historical importance. With an

cardboard measures 21 X 15 inches, and
will be mailed ﬂat.

Prices: 20 cents each; two for 35
cents; three for 50 cents; 12 for $1.75;
postpaid, when sent to the same address.
If sent separately, regardless of the
number, the price is 20 cents each.

More Work in Tacoma

Mrs. Florida L. Byrne, whose humane
educational work in Tacoma, Washing-
ton, was reviewed in our December num-
ber, visited 17 more public and parochial
schools during the month of November.
Schools in that city have been closed
because of a strike of janitors there, but
as soon as they re—open Mrs. Byrne plans
an extensive campaign in. the East End
where humane education is greatly
needed. The editors of the East Side
Review are offering hearty co-operation,
and the ﬁght against cruelty will be car-
ried on in the press, in churches and in
clubs of the district. During the present
school year Mrs. Byrne hopes to devote
her time to work among the kindergar-
tens, primary grades and special classes.
She is distributing quantities of humane
literature in schools and through Parent-
Teacher Associations.

Annual Humane Poster Contest

Open to Pupils in Public and Parochial Schools in Massachnsetts

ESsPITE the scarcity of metal,
D because of its demand for use in

defense work, the Massachusetts
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals has been able to secure new and
very attractive bronze medals to be used
as prizes in its annual state-wide Hu-
mane Poster Contest. As in previous
years, the Contest will be open to pupils
in grammar grades above the third, and
in junior high and high schools—both
public and parochial.

Medals with blue ribbon will be
awarded as ﬁrst prizes; medals with red
ribbon as second prizes; and annual sub-
scriptions to Our Dumb Animals for
honorable mentions. Prizes will be dis-
tributed liberally in all competing
schools. Last season 8,391 posters were
entered by pupils from 545 schools, in
176 cities and towns, and 1,228 ﬁrst
awards were made, 1,345 second, and
1,571 honorable mentions.

Through the courtesy of JORDAN
MARSH COMPANY, WASHINGTON
STREET, BOSTON, many of the prize-
winning posters will be on display in
that store during Be Kind to Animals
Week. We hope to be able to exhibit at
least 500 of the outstanding posters
there. The room in which the exhibit
will be held will be announced later.

The Contest will close positively on
March 28, 1942. Results will be an-
nounced during Be Kind to Animals
Week, April 20—25.

THE FOLLOWING RULES ARE
IMPORTANT:

1. No more than ﬁve posters may be
submitted from one room and one only
from each pupil, teachers to make the
selection. Schools and, so far as possible,
grades, will be judged independently of
each other, with, however, a certain
standard being kept in mind.

2. Pencil or crayon, pen and ink, cut-
out paper (original, not magazine covers,
or pictures) silhouette, water colors or
charcoal may be used. Color adds greatly
to the effectiveness.

3. Drawings, on light cardboard or
heavy paper, should be not less than
12 x 18 inches, nor more than 18 x 24
inches, and should be shipped ﬂat
(never rolled), all charges prepaid, to
reach the Massachusetts S. P. C. A. not
later than March 28, 1942.

4. NOTE CAREFULLY: In the up-
per right-hand corner, on the back of
each poster, must be written legibly, the
contestant’s name, WITH FULL HOME
ADDRESS, (be sure to give street and
number), also number of the grade,
name and address of the school, and
name of teacher. Use white ink, or paste

a white slip with name and address
when dark cardboard or paper is used.

5. All posters receiving award-s be-
come the property of the Society. Other
posters will be returned only if request?
is made at time of sending and return.
postage enclosed, or arrangments made
to call.

6. ADDRESS ALL POSTERS
PLAINLY, ALL CHARGES PREPAID,
to SECRETARY, MASSACHUSETTS
S. P. C. A., 180 LONGWOOD AVENUE,
BOSTON, to reach this ofﬁce by March
28, 1942, at the latest.

Education that stresses inherent good
qualities in every child is more inter-
esting to me than the culture of plants.
Entirely without biological comparison,
the child as well as the plant has desir-
able tendencies and qualities —— those of
the child to be nurtured into an active-
appreciation of good.

The Donkey’s Serenade

Leslie Clare Manchester

“I call to you across the meres,
0 Lady of the Slender Ears!
I sing to you of common things,
The clod, the bloom, the Iilt of wings:
Haw, he-haw, he-haw!
The gay fire-flies with golden maw
A glory from the darkness draw,
A constellation—haw, he-haw!

“You listen and your round eyes shine;
You harken to this theme of mine!

‘Once more I tell of what I see

.Perched on a branch of a tall old tree:
Haw, he-haw, he-haw!

.An owl there is with speckled craw
Against a full moon pale as straw,

A horned-owl dreaming—haw, he-hawl"

Nest Made of Watch Springs

IRDS make their nests out of many

different materials, but a bird at
Soleure in Switzerland made use of an
unusual substance to construct its home,
:says an Exchange. Settling in a neigh-
lborhood in which a number of watch-
:makers had their shops, the bird con-
:structed a nest from cast off or broken
watch springs which were lying about
in near-by yards. A watchmaker discov-
ered the completed nest and
found it to be made entirely of
watch springs and less than one-
half of an inch wide. When the
brood had been raised the nest
was taken down and placed in
the local museum as a striking
example of the ingenuity of
birds.

The honeybee has eleven kinds
of tools on its legs. These in-
clude different kinds of rakes,
Ebrushes, combs, spurs, presses,
:and baskets, each designed for a
special useful purpose in the
lousy life of the bee.

Nerve us with incessant af-
ﬁrmatives. Don’t bark against
the bad, but chant the beauties

Britain’s Police Horses
E . R . Y A R H A M

Photograph by Jas.

HE horse is probably the most timid

of all animals. Frightened horses
may charge straight into a stone wall as
if it were not there. Or, at the other
extreme, a terriﬁed horse may become
absolutely stiff and motionless.

Yet among the greatest heroes of the
heavy air raids on Britain’s cities have
been the horse allies of the police, to
whom Mr. Churchill paid a tribute a
short time back. Probably the most
astonishing thing is that London’s 250
or so police horses went through the
worst raids on the capital and not a sin-
gle one was hurt.

What is more, they became absolutely
use-d to the noise of falling bombs and
the terriﬁc crescendo of the anti-air-
craft barrage, paying little more atten-
tion to them than to the cheering of
crowds and the noise which accompanies
the pageantry of peace-time processions.

England’s police horses are the most
remarkable example of what can be done
by kindness and by engendering trust in
the animals for their masters. Their

amazing control over their emotions and
fears is only made possible by patience
and careful training.

The success at-

 

THOUGH EXTREMELY TIMID, THE HORSE
QUICK TO LEARN TO CONTROL HIS

EMOTIONS

R. Parker

tained is the more remarkable when one
remembers that the animals chosen are
not of the stolid cart—horse type, but
among the ﬁnest breeds obtainable, very
highly strung from birth. Only these
horses possess the degree of intelligence
essential.

There are training schools in London
and the Provinces staffed by men who
have had long experience in handling
horses. All the mounted policemen have
been through the ranks as ordinary con-
stables before they are drafted to the
training schools, and the most of them
have considerable knowledge of a horse’s
temperament. The ideal aimed at is to
give the man his horse and as far as
possible to ensure that he keeps that
mount afterwards when on active ser-
vice.

In this way the man gets to know the
peculiarities of his horse’s character and
exactly what it will do, while the animal
learns every intonation of his master’s
voice. The team-work between the two is
soon of the closest—the horse reacts to
the slightest pressure of the knee, a
movement of the hand so slight as to be
unnoticeable to the onlookers in a crowd,
or a whispered word. The constable
grooms his own horse, and the men’s
pride in their mounts is great.

Before a horse is allowed to go on the
streets, particularly these days, it is put
through tests of extreme stiffness. Late-
ly the horses have been taught to ignore
the sound of gunﬁre and bursting bombs,
and it is found that the best way to train
the young and high-spirited horses is to
have older, fully-trained and more staid
ones with them. So when the noise of
ﬁring, pistol shots, heavy bangs, and so
on suddenly interrupt the silence, the
trained horses merely ﬂick their tails or
cook an ear. The youngsters, on the other
hand, shy and rear up, or try to unseat
their riders. But the calmness of the
older horses helps to calm them, too.

Red ﬂags are wave-d directly in front
of these horses; men spring out una-
wares; and the horses are taught to face
crowds in as realistic a way as possible.
They must stand immobile while people
crush round them, learn to push the
crowds while they are cheering back
into line. One of their most difﬁcult tests
is picking their way over stuffed ﬁgures
on the ground, representing fallen peo-
ple.

Most difficult of all is training horses
to face smoke and ﬁre because they are
naturally frightened of ﬂame. But with
careful tuition they learn to pass through
great clouds of smoke with conﬁdence.
It usually takes about six months to
train a police horse.

The White Doe of the
Logging Camp

R. M. WORKMAN

HE loggers ﬁrst saw her when she

was very young. They were return-
ing to the camp on the logging train and
she was grazing on the logged-off hill-
side near the track. After that they
watched for her and the train-crew left
bread where she could ﬁnd it, and told
stories of other white deer which had
been seen in the old days, and some
claimed that the old Indian legend was
true that a white deer brought good
luck to those who befriended it.

Through the months she grew, her
pure white coat shining against 'the
green of the ﬁreweed, and as the days
passed and she grew more and more
familiar with the sight of the train and
of the men, she fed nearer the track,
and ate the bread they would leave for
her from their lunches.

Then one day she was not there when
the train passed. The men looked and
wondered, and when they reached camp
the word went around that the white
deer had not been seen that morning.
Nor on the next morning, or the morn-
ings which followed. There began to be
questions, angry murmurings, and at
East one day a man talked too much.
Being the type of man he was, he
boasted of what he had done. He said
her skin was soft as white wool, that
:she was pure albino, for her eyes were
pink and even the little hooves were
white. With ﬂashlight and gun he had
gone out to ﬁnd her and had succeeded.
Why? He really didn’t know, except
that he always wanted a white deerskin.
But the men to whom he told that story
stopped in their work and looked at
him, and there was something in their
eyes and in their silence that must have
frightened him, for that night when he
(tame home he burned the white skin
and the last of the meat.

Ofﬁcers came the next day, but there
was no trace. That did not matter; his
own words had betrayed him and he paid
his ﬁne and thought that would be the
end of the story, but his punishment had
only begun. Men did not speak to him,
or if they didit was with aversion and
words which showed their contempt, and
the women who knew him, looked the
other way as they passed him by. That
is no light punishment in a logging
camp, isolated from contacts through
which he might escape and bound by
the narrow limits of a small community;
but, of course, eventually people forget,
or shrug and make allowances. Nothing
anyone can do or say will bring back the
white deer to the slopes where she fed,
or, so the old men of the camp say,
bring back to the valley the gift of good
fortune which the white deer carried.

Winter Exercise for Cattle

ALFRED S.

N winter mornings the inside of the

barn is snug and; warm in contrast
to the bitter air outside. The cows stand
contentedly chewing their cud; the calves
bawl for their breakfasts, the heifers
stretch out their heads for hay. It seems
a shame to drive them outside into the
cold for their morning drink.

It wouldn’t be difﬁcult to bring the
water to them. On the other hand, ani-
mals need exercise in winter as well as in
summer. Besides, as soon as the days be-
gin to shorten, cattle develop long, heavy
coats which effectively keep out the win-
ter’s chill. So out they go.

“The old cow” goes ﬁrst. She backs
out of her stanchion, turns deliberately
and walks out of the barn door. She
yawns, stretches her back and moves
slowly to the pasture gate. “Sarnia” is
next. As soon as she is free of her stan-
chion she begins to lick herself from head
to foot, and has to be pushed outside, to
complete her toilet there. Seeing “the
old cow” near the bars, she follows.

The two of them walk sedately through
the snowy pasture, down towards the
brook. Fromtheir unconcern, it might be
a balmy June day. But they stop, turn
and stare as they hear a sound behind
them. It’s the ﬁve heifers; “Lady,” “Pa-
tience,” “Whimsy,” “Nightshade” and
“Butterball,” released from their pens,
galloping and prancing after them, tails
stuck straight up. The cows are sudden-
ly electriﬁed, and join the mad race.
They throw their heels up in ridiculous
antics, they pretend to toss each other
on their horns. Then they reach the
brook.

There are open stretches of black
water, bitter cold. They take tiny sips,

 
   

CAMPBELL

lick their muzzles and nostrils, take more
sips. Then, when their insides are used
to the cold water, they drink in long
noisy gulps. Their sides plump out. Fi-
nally, they are ﬁlled to the bursting point.
They back away from the water, lick
their own backs and sides, stretch, shake
their feet like dogs. Their breath steams
up into the frosty air.

Finally “the old cow” hears the calves,
still in the barn, calling. Her ears prick
up, she turns and starts up the hill. The
other animals fall into procession behind
her. Sedately, they plod back to the barn.
They aren’t cold; just refreshed. All the
kinks are out of their muscles. They have
scratched all the itching places on their
bodies by rubbing against trees. They
are contented.

They walk to their accustomed places
in the barn. The stanchions rattle, pen
doors click shut. There is the rustle of
new hay thrown in mangers, the clank of
feed buckets and the smacking and gurg-
ling of the hungry calves as they drink
eagerly from full udders. The open barn
door has allowed fresh air to circulate
through the entire structure. Close it,
and in three minutes the inside is-warm
and snug again. Now the cattle will be
satisﬁed to stand until night, when ,once-
more they will have a walk, a gallop and
a long drink.

There are 110 species of snake-s in
the United States, and only the cotton-
mouth, copperhead, coral snake, and rat-
tlers are poisonous.

Caged Bird Exhibition

The Massachusetts Caged Bird Asso-
ciation Silver Jubilee show was held at
Horticultural Hall, Boston, November
29 and 30. More than 750 birds, all
brilliantly colorful, were shown, and a
large number of prizes were awarded by
the judges. The Massachusetts S.P.C.A.
was a beneﬁciary of the proceeds.

One of the most interesting birds on
exhibition was the Arctic snowy owl
which had been found exhausted in Wal-
tham and brought to the Angell Memo—
rial Hospital. Through the courtesy of
the Massachusetts S.P.C.A. and the
Massachusetts Fish and Game Division
this unusual bird was seen by the bird
show patrons before it was liberated.

1. Question: For the last several
years my Irish setter dog has had trouble
with his ears. Periodically they become
irritated and ﬁlled with a dark. foul-
smelling, substance. The dog shakes his
head considerably and keeps pawing at
his ears. I have taken him to four dif-
ferent veterinarians and have been giv-
en as many treatments, all equally un-
successful. Can anything be done to cor-
rect this trouble?

Answer: Your faith in veterinarians
is probably somewhat shaken at this
point. However, this condition affecting
your dog is one that is a problem to all
veterinarians. Whether or not the con-
dition can be corrected medically cannot
be deﬁnitely said. There is an operation
that is usually successful in the hands
of a veterinarian who is quite familiar
with the technique. If you wish you
could bring your dog to our hospital for
advice.

2. Question: We are contemplating
moving to a new home. How can we be
reasonably assured that our cat will not
stray away from its new home?

Answer: If the cat is a pet cat and is
used to staying in the house a lot and
petted considerably, you should have no
trouble if he is kept shut in the
new home for a week or so. After that
time you may let the animal out for .
short periods and call him into the house
frequently. If the cat is one that is not
a house pet, and is usually out most of
the time, you may encounter some difﬁ-
culty in holding him in his new environ-
ment.

3. Question: Our cat, a female four
months old, frequently licks the ﬂoors
and rugs around the house; and while
outdoors she licks the cement and even
dirt. Why should she do this?

Answer: Such actions as you describe
are usually due to some dietary disturb-
ance in young animals. It is probably a
mineral deﬁciency and for correction you
should consult your veterinarian.

4. Question: Our children received a
cocker spaniel puppy for Christmas. Will
you please advise us how to raise this
puppy, as we have never had this ex-
perience.

Answer: Such a question deserves a
lengthy answer which space prohibits in
this column. An excellent book on this
subject is available at nearly all book—
stores. Its title is “How to Raise a Dog
in the City and Suburbs” by Dr. James
Kinney, the veterinarian in charge of
the Speyer Hospital in New York City.
It is published by Simon and Schuster.

This book covers every phase of rais-
ing a dog and is written in a very inter-
esting and humorous style.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Animal Life in Porcelain

ALETHA M.

“I like to see my old friends . . . on teacups—
See horses . . . here a cow and rabbit couchant and
co-extensive. ”
“Essays of Elia” (“Old China”), CHARLES LAMB

F I 0 industrial art has a history so
full of charm and color as that of
porcelain. Because of its resemb—

lance to a species of shell, called by the

Italians porcellana, or “little pig” (be—

cause of the shape), the stone-hard

snow-white translucid ware was early
given the name it now bears.

The Chinese invented it, and it is from
this fact that the substance is also called
china-ware. The discovery was made in
the early centuries (authorities differ,
but some say the sixth), however the art
was not introduced into Europe until
around 1709, when a factory was estab-
lished at Dresden.

A combination of clays, porcelain
forms a book-length story in point of
history and technique of manufacture,
yet of all the many chapters of achieve-
ment none are more entertaining than
those dealing with the decorative designs.

Animals and birds occupy an all-
important place in such decoration, and
add greater interest to the portrayal of
legends, and national history, so artisti—
cally represented in ceramic art.

“Exotic” birds were popular motifs in
the pioneer product of the Chinese, and
these, together with certain animals,
possessed symbolical meaning. The crane
was called the “patriarch of the feath-
ered tribes,” the horse was invested with
strength, the hare with timidity; while
the vigor and endurance of other beasts
were virtues held before the youth of the
Orient as examples of emulation. In
short, “sermons were preached in animal-
adorned china.”

With the march of time each nation
manufactured its own peculiar type of
porcelain, and ceramic annals reveal the
fact that animal life continued to be
prominently represented in every period.
Manufacturers, too, chose certain birds
and animals as individual trade-marks
of their respective wares; one example
of this being found in designs of the
famous old Dutch Delft—a factory estab—
lished at the Hague in 1775—which
marked all of its china with the ﬁgure
of a stork. Also much handsome table-
ware of later European dating bore
eagle, and deer-head trade-marks.

The crow and the snowy heron were
often displayed together on the surface
of a dish, proving a startling contrast in
black and white, and many a magniﬁcent
vase of porcelain has carried a garden
scene, with a crane placed near a
dwarfed pine.

The earliest pieces extant of the rare
old Chelsea (English) china are two
cream jugs of the “goat and bee” de-
sign. Other specimens of later-period

BONNER

Chelsea include “fables” on tea-sets,
with gay birds and beasts represented.

On rare tableware, coming from the
porcelain works of Adams in Tunstall,
Staffordshire, England, are pictured
striking scenes from “the new world.”
One priceless old set of dishes carries
the title, “The Landing of Columbus,”
and here on plates and platters are por-
trayed a wilderness inlet, with boats at
anchor. Columbus, Spanish companions,
and native red men are featured, and
tents and wolf—dogs are also in evidence.
The border-designs are made up of tiny
landscape scenes, wherein roam wild
deer and moose.

Other and more contemporary periods
of progress in American history have
been represented in tableware, and in
this pageantry of porcelain animals have
taken their place side by side with great
men and great movements—which is as
it shouldbe, for truly have these sturdy
servants of mankind left imperishable
records of achievement, and we are
pleased to honor them in every phase of
the art-life of our nation.

Washington Drives Out

In Philadelphia six bay horses,
groomed under the direction of German
John, drew a cream-colored English-
built coach, writes Charles Moore in
“The Family Life of George Washing-
ton.”

The stables, one of the city sights,
contained ten bays and two white
chargers; and Solomon himself was not
groomed like one of these saddle-horses.
At night they were coated with a paste
and swathed with bodycloths, and the
straw of their beds was fresh and very
clean; in the morning their coats were
rubbed and curried and brushed until
they shone like satin; their 'hoofs were
blacked, their mouths were washed and
their teeth picked; their leopard—skin
housings were arranged; and then they
were ready for the use of the ﬁnest and
most fastidious of horsemen. The repu—
tation of the Washington equipage had
been established during Colonial days,
in rivalry at Williamsburg with Colonel
Byrd of Westover, when it was “the bays
against the grays.”

Squirrels plant more trees than man.
Our largest oak and hickory forests were
planted by the squirrels. They bury more
nuts than they can eat thereby leaving
many to sprout and grow into trees.

Our readers are urged to clip from
“Our Dumb Animals” various articles
and request local editors to republish.
Such copies will be made good by us
upon application.

AN EXAMPLE OF GOOD CARE
AND GROOMING

 

Washington’s War Horse

Besides General Washington another
veteran of the Revolutionary War retired
to peaceful Mount Vernon after the con—
ﬂict, there to receive the homage of
members of the household and visitors.
His name was “Nelson” and he was the
General’s favorite horse, who had car-
ried his master safely through the long
campaign. Nelson’s days of work were
over and :he spent his time grazing
peacefully in the pasture. No one ever
rode him, but the children, Nellie and
George Custis, the adopted children of
General Washington, were privileged to
pet and play with the old war horse.
Often the General, on his rounds of his
farms and stables, stopped to stroke the
white face of his faithful horse who
always showed his delight at the caress.

From April, 1917, to May, 191.9, the
cost of the World War averaged over
$1,000,000 an hour. Including about
$10,000,000 loaned to the allies, the total
cost of the War (to the United States)
was $22,000,000,000, or more than the
whole cost of operating the government
from 1791 to 1914.

The emperor penguin in Antarctica
shows no fear of man. Explorers re-
port this bird as being not only fearless
but respectful also. No other bird in the
world shows man so much politeness. It
walks upright and has the habit of bow-
ing with the greatest of respect.

Dehorning Cattle

WE wish every farmer in the land
could read what we are writing.
It would, so far as farmers are humane
and wise, save a vast amount of suffer-
ing and no little money. Leaving out
of the account the whole question of
cruelty in the dehorning process and
the reasons assigned for depriving the
cattle of these weapons of attack and
defense, admitting the greater docility
of the individual animal and the herd
when hornless, why wait till dehorning
must .be done by methods that cause
pain and involve expense?

In Ireland for a long time the require-
ment has been enforced, if we remember
rightly, by law, that the growth of the
horn be stopped in the calf. This is the
simple operation: Take the calf at any-
time under two weeks of age, better
under one week, moisten the slight
bunches on the head where the horns
are to grow with a little water, then rub
these spots with a pencil of nitrate of
silver, not breaking the skin but just
irritating it till it becomes red. The calf
will scarcely mind the sensation, though
it may shake its head occasionally for a
few minutes. It will never develop any
horns.

We have tried this experiment person-
ally on a large number of calves, seen
them drink immediately after it as if
nothing had happened and watched them
grow up hornless cattle. Anyone who
has witnessed the dehorning of mature
animals cannot imagine a farmer or a
dairyman ever permitting his young
stock to be neglected till it becomes
necessary to subject them to such an
ordeal, when at no expense and in so
painless a way the development of the

horn may be stopped at its very be-
ginning.

Ship’s Mascot Breaks Paw

NXIOUS to set foot for the ﬁrst
time on United States soil the Eski-
mo husky d-og, mascot on one of Uncle
Sam’s warships returned to Boston from
patrol duty in Arctic waters, leaped over
the ship’s rail to the dock and fractured
his left paw. He
was taken to the
Angel] Animal Hos-
pital where officers
of the ship told how
the dog, who prefers
to stay on deck in

affection of all on
board the warship

visit their mascot
and to bring him his

What of Our Future?

URING recent months we have often

been concerned with the future as it
relates to the work of our Societies. Our
work has increased by leaps and bounds,
necessitating more employees and greater
expenses—but our income has been re-
duced, due to smaller returns on our in-
vestments, fewer legacies and donations.
In the future, as in the past, much good
work must remain undone for the want
of funds. We realize that our members
and friends are called upon to donate to
many different organizations—that taxes
are high and the efforts to win the war
come foremost.

Our work for kindness—our efforts to
prevent cruelty—our hope that men,
women and children may learn to better
appreciate animals and make kindness a
habit must continue. With the continued
interest and support of our friends, we
shall not fail.

Judge Lewis E. Sisson of the Green-
wich, Connecticut, Court, in passing judg—
ment on a case before him, stated, “In
every trust involving the custody of a
living being, it is morally imperative
that the care bestowed shall be in direct
proportion to the helplessness of the child
or animal involved. The pattern of
domestic civilization is not woven of
neglect and cruelty but of kindness and
consideration.”

In Hawaii dogs, too, must obey black—
out regulations. If dogs are found at
large during the hours of blackout they
are promptly impounded, and the owner
is subject to a ﬁne of ﬁfty dollars.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Is the Horse Coming Back?

ITH gasoline and rubber rationing

and the “freezing” of automobiles,
it is perhaps reasonable to assume that
the horse will stage a comeback in our
cities. Daily we see horse—drawn taxi-
cabs and sight—seeing busses, and here
and there an occasional buckboard and,
we presume, our grandparents are smil—
ing at the prospect of today’s boys and
girls becoming acquainted with the faded
glory of other years. But is the horse
really coming back? After all one can’t
just order a thousand three-year-old
horses and then expect them to come off
the production line pronto. No, nature
will have to be asked to co-operate but
that, of course, takes time. Some time
ago a friend of the Society’s, a newspaper
woman, expressed the thought that, much
as she loved horses, she hoped they would
not come back in large numbers.

Her fears were not unfounded. The
lack of trained stablehands and drivers
has already brought disaster to many a
stable owner. Horses suffering from
Azoturia, which can easily be avoided,
are often brought to our Hospital. Few
can be saved. Our agents are kept busy
examining and checking the horses al-
ready acquired by newspapers and taxi
concerns.

Old-timers at our Hospital can remem-
ber when our daily horse population
would run to 35, with every box—stall and
stable crowded. We still have splendid
facilities for horses at the Angell Hos-
pital—excellent box—stalls, a large tan—
bark, horse operating room, completely
equipped with table and instruments, and
an able veterinary staff who know horses.

Will the facilities be used again? Only
time will tell.

Another Seeing-Eye Dog

We have just seen the photograph of a
remarkable Seeing-Eye dog, familiar to
the people of Waltham, Massachusetts.
This dog is the constant friend and com—
panion of a Miss Madeliene Delight
Brooks who, though blind now for many
years, is one of the highly competent
operators in the waltham Watch Com-
pany, Waltham, whose accuracy is pro-
nounced by her superior as good as any-
one else’s, doing the same line of work.

The dog accompanies Miss Brooks
everywhere, and lies at her feet through
the day near the bench where she is at
work, greatly worried if she disappears
even for a moment.

Miss Brooks is a graduate of the New
England Conservatory of Music, and
once sang at a gathering held here at
our Hospital.

There is an article in this issue on De-
horning, which we think worth reading.
Like the cruelties 0f the slaughter house,
few know anything about it.

Animals in the Movies

JOSEPH F. DINNEEN
in Boston Globe

THE man who stopped Hollywood from
killing and maiming horses for enter-
tainment and amusement on the screen
is now stationed in Boston. He is Eric
H. Hansen, young and personable vice-
president of the Massachusetts Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals, Longwood Ave. Until two years
ago, it was common in Hollywood to kill
or maim a horse when the script called
for it. Animals always have had, and
probably always will have, an important
place in pictures. When realism became
cruelty, there was a quick rising tide of
criticism and it had almost immediate
results.

“This criticism reached a boiling point
in 1940 when humane societies the coun-
try over decided they could no longer
tolerate the torture of animals for the
sake of amusement. A job had to be
done. A capable man was needed and
Hansen, then general manager of the
American Humane Association, was se-
lected. He went to Hollywood and met
the producers on their home grounds,
cited a number of particularly glaring
cases of cruelty and began negotiations
that ﬁnally ended in agreements which
standardized movie practices, as far as
animals were concerned, and reduced the
mortality rate to zero.”

Upon Mr. Hansen’s recommendation,
Richard C. Craven, an honest and ca-
pable executive associated with the
American Humane Association, was ap-
pointed to the full—time job at Hollywood
by the Association, to see to the pro-
tection of all animals used in the movies;
and now all scripts involving animals are
cleared through Mr. Craven’s oﬂice.
Cruelty to animals in the picture busi—
ness is ended.

Horses Rescued In Air Raid

A correspondent, writing to a news-
paper in Leeds, England, gives a vivid
account of the visit of the Princess Royal
to the town of York, which was so badly
stricken by air raids. The Princess saw
the ruins of many little houses and con-
soled with the bereaved and talked with
many of the families in the bombed
areas.

One of many heroes who were pre—
sented to her was Mr. Alfred Martin,
who rescued 19 horses from their blazing
stables. “You did a wonderful job of
work,” the Princess Royal told him.

Incendiary bombs fell on the roof
which was soon enveloped by ﬂames.

“When I got the horses out,” Mr. Mar-
tin said, “their bodies were so hot I
could not put my hand on them. Even
so, it was not so difficult for me, because
I know them all and they know me.”

Small Thunder in Their Wings

Jane Sloan

From out the dark, across the moon,
And into the silent night,

I heard the winging of wild ducks,
Small thunder in their flight.

Beyond the curving earth and free
This living cloud passed by,

Its graceful motion shuttering
The silver in the sky.

0, to capture that distant sound,
The music of nomad wings,

And know again the fragile touch
Of ecstasy it brings.

Florida an Ideal Bird Sanctuary
MARY DYER LEMON

0 many rare species of birds thrive

in southern Florida that that region
has been declared an ideal sanctuary,
the advantages of which are only now
being faintly recognized.

Less than 700 great white herons sur-
vive, out of the millions of these wonder-
fully useful birds once so prevalent in
Florida before man’s inhumanity made
pitiful inroads upon these beautiful
ﬂocks. Now, however, fully protected
by law, they are slowly increasing in
numbers. The heron, often confused
with the crane, is strictly waterfowl,
while the crane, not unlike a goose, is a
land bird, though inhabiting swamp or
water areas. Only a few of the regal
sand-hill crane variety are to be found,
but given a chance to live and propagate,
the balance of nature will again be re-
stored and these vast ﬂat lands of Flor-
ida will once more be serving the pur-
pose for which they were intended.

The European stork does very well in
Florida, as does also the crowned or
dancing crane from Africa, with mag-
niﬁcent plumage and a crown of stiff,
wire-like feathers, each tipped with a
golden bead. In such a climate these
birds could multiply by the thousands.

Flamingos, pheasants, swans—all of
these with protection and care will some
day ﬁll Florida with color and bird song.
The millions of land acres and coastal
areas make that state ideal for a bird
sanctuary, and it is encouraging to note
that an increase of bird life is becoming
apparent there, even to the layman.

Birds are much like human beings in
their relation to life. They are con-
stantly seeking natural rights such as
pure water, abundant food, a congenial
environment, a sheltered home, the pres-
ervation of the family, and protection
from their enemies. In obtaining these
essentials man may lend his support to
the proﬁt of both bird and man.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Rescuing a Fledgling Songbird
MORLEY COOPER

HERE exists a belief that a baby

bird, having fallen from its nest, is
doomed to die unless it can be returned
to its mother’s care, but my experience
is to the contrary.

“Toots” is a pine siskin. A bluejay
raided his mother’s nest when he was
less than a week old, and kicked him out
of it. He fell hard, landing directly in
front of our trailer, where we were en-
cam'ped in the High Sierras. When I
picked him up he staggered to his feet,
perched himself on my thumb, and
peeped lustily at me. His only injury
was manifested in a drooping right wing.

The mother bird at once deserted her
wrecked nest and never again returned.
We know nothing of bird culture, but
after my ﬁrst unfortunate experiments
with whole angleworms, we hit on the
idea of feeding Toots with a paste of
wheat germ and canned milk, fed with
a toothpick. On this diet, supplemented
with water from a medicine dropper, and
a bit of tomato or apple pulp, the tiny
siskin grew amazingly. Within two
weeks he was nearly full—grown and
ready to ﬂy.

Until then our only intention was to
return him to his wild state. But it soon
developed that Toots would never ﬂy
well. His drooping wing made long
ﬂight impossible, and it would soon be
necessary for him to migrate to the
warm low country for the winter.

We set him free, but each night he

 

DOOR OF HIS CAGE

Page 1 1 7'

roasted in a near—by bush, and each
morning at six he was on the trailer
step cheeping for his breakfast. During
the day he played about the camp, but
whenever he became hungry he came
home and demanded to be fed.

His crippled wing and his dependence
on us made it imperative that we keep
him as a pet. And when he suddenly
began to sing as beautifully as any
canary, we knew we would never part
with him. So we bought a cage, and
took him home with us on our return
from camp.

After a year, Toots is still a half-wild
bird, for we keep him in his cage only
part of the time. He is extremely af-
fectionate, and considers himself not an
inferior pet, but one of the family. He
ﬂies sufﬁciently well to get about the
house, although we do not let him out—
doors. Much of the time he perches on
my shoulder, or, when I am writing, he
likes to sit on my wrist, or at the top of
the pad, and watch the pencil move.

If I am too busy to pay him attention,
he will hop to my shoulder and begin
nibbling gently, and then more insist-
ently and painfully, at the lobe of my
ear, until I speak to him. He then kisses
me by inserting his beak between my
lips, hops down, socks the eraser of my
pencil hard twice, and ﬂies away. Toots
is afraid of only two things on earth—
my umbrella, and a certain hat my wife
wears.

He is still fed wheat germ, but in
addition to that and his seed, there are
fresh bits of app-1e, orange, carrot, and
tomato in his cage each morning.

Our friends speak of Toots as being
an extremely fortunate bird. But con-
sidering the pleasure he has given us,
I am daily thankful we did not permit
the superstition that a tiny bird cannot
live to maturity without its mother’s
care prevent our making the effort to
raise him. Next time you see a live baby
bird on the ground, don’t leave him
there on the assumption that no one but
his mother can care for him. Perhaps
this ﬂedgling may develop into as ﬁne
a pet as did Toots.

The nest of the meadowlark is always
hidden in grassy places in dry ﬁelds or
grain. Good farmers avoid letting their
mowing-machines pass over the nests if
they ﬁnd them because they know the
value of this bird in the destruction of
enormous quantities of grasshoppers and
other destructive insects. These birds,
like others which nest on the ground,
suffer considerably from loss of their
eggs by meadow-mice and snakes.

Our readers are urged to clip from
“Our Dumb Animals” various articles
and request local editors to republish.
Such copies will be made good by us upon
application.

Four-Footed National
Emblems

JASPER B. SINCLAIR

UST as the bald eagle has long since

been adopted as the national emblem

of the United States, so have many of our

four-footed friends been selected as the

symbols of various countries in the Old
and New Worlds.

Across the Atlantic, the British lion
and the British bulldog share honors as
the national emblems of Great Britain.
In the early days the lion was also the
emblem of Scotland, and is still portrayed
on the thousand-year-old Scottish royal
standard, one of the oldest of all ﬂags.

Aussies claim the ungainly kangaroo
as the national emblem of Australia,
while the Russian bear is the centuries
old symbol of that country.

The white elephant was for many years
the symbol of Siam, the country that is
now called Thailand, and it was so ad-
vertised to the world on the Siamese ﬂag.

The old Siamese kings, by the way,
had an embarrassing custom of present-
ing white elephants to persons incurring
royal disfavor. That practice made a
“white elephant” synonymous in our
language with an unwanted gift of any
sort.

TChe tiger was the emblem of the
Province of Mysore, in India, and the
lion the symbol of Abyssinia. Since
ancient times the ruling Ethiopian em-
perors have included among their long-
winded collection of titles the one about
the “All Conquering Lion of Judah.”

Canada has pictured the caribou on
enough varieties of postage stamps to
entitle that animal to rank as the four—
footed emblem of our Dominion neigh-
bors. In the same part of the world it
is worth remembering that the New-
foundland dog and the Labrador retriever
have given those colonies their share of
publicity.

ATTLE that grunt instead of bel-

snow for food, may be future in-
habitants of vast areas in northern Can—
ada. For twenty years experiments in
development of the “cattalo”—-a cross
between buffalo and domestic cattle,—
have been proceeding, are now nearing
the stage where the Canadian Depart—
ment of Agriculture ofﬁcials expect that

by 1943 animals three-quarters domestic
cattle and one—quarter buffalo will be
bred successfully. The cattalo will turn
areas where existing cattle could not
thrive, into ranching country, according
to Dr. Alan Deakin of the department’s
animal husbandry division. There are
now 126 cattalo (hybrids) at the gov-
ernment’s station at Wainwright, A1-
berta.

 

Our Friends—the Snakes

MARJORIE S. GLYNN

F you were living in the tropics, one

of your best friends, and one that

might save your life, some day, would be
—— a snake!

Yes, that is true. The Mussurana, a
six-foot reptile, while menacing-looking
with its size and iridescent coloring,
would be the best pet you could have.
Why? Because the Mussurana, while
friend-1y and harmless to humans, is a
cannibal, and its favorite food is other
snakes, preferably poisonous ones.

Then, here in our own country, there
is the king snake, a beautifully marked
and large serpent that dines on—rattlers.
He will go out of his way to hunt them
up and eat them. If one crosses his path
accidentally, it is just too bad for Mr.
Rattler. He is doomed to make a meal
for his arch enemy, the king snake, which
is rightly named as he is truly the master
of all reptiles—fearless and aggressive.

The farmer’s friend—should be the

name of our common garter or striped
snake, as it is sometimes called. This
snake eats small rodents and insects that
prey upon the farmer’s crops.

Do you want to have a nice garden?
Then, don’t kill that little green snake
that slithers so gracefully between the
growing plants. He is the guardian of
the garden, and will repay you for your
tolerance many times over.

Did you ever see a worm that seemed
to have a little spine on the end of its
tail? Chances are you were looking not
at an earthworm, but at a worm snake,
which is really a snake and not a worm
at all. It is so named because of its size
and similarity to the worm. It is the
tiniest of the snakes, being only a few
inches long. It is blind and spends its
time burrowing like a worm in the earth,
where it hunts out and eats insect eggs.

SO it, too, might be called the farmer’s
friend.

Please remember the Massachusetts
S. P. C. A. when making your will.

The Fun-loving Otter
GLADYS JORDAN

LIPPING like a swift, dark shadow
through the water the otter pursues
his prey. His thick whiskers twitch and
his small black eyes gleam as his strong
curved claws close over the slippery ﬁsh
that tries so unsuccessfully to evade him.
Having captured his prey he brings it
to the shore where like a true epicure he
devours it at leisure and in a most me-
thodical manner. Taking the ﬁsh in his
front paws he begins at the head and
eats always toward the tail. Having
reached the tail he examines it carefully
and then lays it aside. Either his appe—
tite is satisﬁed or it fails to tempt him
for "he invariably discards it.

The otter is a great ﬁsherman and the
Chinese make use of this fact and train
it when young to catch ﬁsh and bring
them ashore. In Bengal the ﬁshermen
train the otter to drive the ﬁsh into wait—
ing nets. Here in America the ﬁsher-
men have not yet gone into partnership
with the otter, as far as the writer
knows.

The otters are mostly nocturnal ani—
mals. They enjoy swimming about at
night, often wandering from stream to
stream in the winter time. They. build
their burrows near some stream, often
digging some depth into the bank. The
nest is lined with leaves or grass. They
can swim beneath the surface for a long
time and handle themselves marvelously
while in the water. They twist and turn
their lithe bodies in swift gyrations when
pursuing their prey. The ﬂattened tail
seems to act as a rudder to guide them
and their short, powerful legs send them
swiftly forward.

Otters are both fun-loving and origi-
nal. Their favorite game is sliding
downhill. They gather in numbers on a
sloping bank by the river or sometimes
on a hill—side, then throwing themselves
ﬁat down upon their bellies, their fore—
legs bent backward, away they go. Their
hind legs give them a strong send-off in
this game. Perhaps our New England
school boys of an earlier day got their

Pet Shop Magic

Lois Snelling

I saw him in a window —

A narrow, prison space —

And as I stood and watched him,
A miracle took place.

The floor became a meadow,
With clover reaching wide
Where little dogs could carry
Their treasured bones to hide.
The window-glass was water,
And I could see him there,
A-splash, among the tules,

With ne’er a thought of care.
The shop was hills and valleys——
I watched them all agleam,
And saw a lilac’s shadow,
Where little dogs could dream.

The spell of magic ended,
And all the beauty fled.

He stood there in his prison,
With eyes that dumbly pled.
The spell of magic ended?
Ah, wizard I would be;

I went inside and bought him,
And took him home with me!

 

idea of sliding from these otters.

The American otter is larger than the
European. Lutra Canadensis is the com-
mon North American variety; the South
American, or Brazilian otter is known
as the coypu. They are an interesting
animal to study and a beautiful and
graceful creature to watch. They seek
their food according to Nature’s law and
live a happy life if not molested by man.

Filling Station for Pigeons

ISABEL C. HANNA

ITH cruelty apparently rampant in

the world and our lives becoming
more disrupted and chaotic daily it is
reassuring to know there are those among
us who still ﬁnd time for gentleness and
kindness. Emery King of Chicago, night
manager of a ﬁlling station, is one of
these. Since 1929 he has not only served
breakfast to an estimated 2,000,000
pigeons but acted as physician, surgeon
and nurse as well. On a shelf partly ﬁlled
with automobile accessories may be found
supplies for his small emergency hospi-
tal. There are prepared splints for small
fractured bones, antiseptics for wounds,
gauze for bandages, as well as castor oil
and other necessities.

By dawn of each day a company of
about ﬁve hundred pigeons has gathered
for breakfast. Nearly every morning
following this repast, which amounts to
100 pounds of cracked corn and peanuts
each week, one or two birds linger after
the others have gone. Perhaps one of
them is hopping about on one leg because
the other is fractured. His drooping com-
panion may be merely listless. Armed
with a handful of peanuts Mr. King easily
catches the ailing birds and from long
experience renders a diagnosis and pre-
scribes treatment. He loses a few pa-
tients a year but he feels conﬁdent he
saves the lives of many.

An average of six ailing or convales-
cent patients occupy cages within the
station house for most of the time. Sev-
eral weeks are required to heal a torn
wing. Broken legs are mended in less
time. Occasionally a bird is found to be
suffering from indigestion or poison.
“Duke,” a permanent resident, has called
the station home ever since he recovered
from acute indigestion four years ago.

Pigeons who come frequently have been
given names. Mr. King recalls that he
once encountered one of these, “Blackie,”
miles from his station. The bird saun—
tered up to him and upon being called
by name ﬂew to his benefactor’s shoulder.

A coral island 300 miles from Mauri—
tius, in the Indian Ocean, is inhabited
only by cats. One or two, even a dozen,
would quickly starve under the circum-
stances, but there are thousands of them.
They have a well organized system of
catching ﬁsh. They congregate at small
pools and channels, at low water, form a
circle and close in on the ﬁsh left in
the pools. Such a “drive” sometimes
yields a ton of ﬁsh!

Beavers, their pond surrounded by a
forest ﬁre, have been seen piling wet mud

To a Cat in the Station
Anna R. Baker

I never saw a cat
So lean and thin!

Is there no kindly porter
Who will take you in

And let you eat at least
The crumbs that fall

From the master's table?
None at all

With pity in his heart,
Or memory that

Goes backward down the years
To some old cat

He loved with boyish love
In years gone by?

Does everyone—like me—
Just heave a sigh

And say, “You poor old cat!"
And ride away?

You’ll haunt me like a specter,
Grim and gray.

Army Men Have Hearts

who had spent 18 of his 36 years
in the Army, prepared to lunge viciously
at a dummy with his bayonet. He was
instructing a class of rookies how to
plunge the dagger-like weapon into an
enemy’s Vitals. He had taken only a few
steps when he noticed an injured
meadow lark ﬂuttering at his feet and
stooped to pick it up.

This incident, which actually hap-
pened in a California training camp, is
eloquent testimony that, in the midst of
preparations for carnage, Army men do
have hearts. Even a stern, impersonal
government goes beyond the ordinary re-
quirements of business and takes that

extra, imaginative step which is a sign
of having a soul. Dumb animals some-
times fare better than human beings in
warfare.

After the Army chose, from a list of
15 possible sites for an artillery range
in the west, an area near Henry Lake
in Montana, it decided to detour in order
to save the lives of birds. The ofﬁcials
who had selected the site discovered
later that this lake is on the ﬂyway of
the trumpeter swan, a rest stop between
its nesting sites in the Red Rock Wild
Life Refuge and Yellowstone National
Park.

There are only a few hundred of these
birds left; they are making a precarious
climb back from the brink of extinction
which a few years ago seemed certain.
When the Army authorities learned this
they at once agreed to take their heavy
shooting elsewhere. So, unless Japanese
bombs should drop in Henry Lake, the
trumpeter birds may rest safely there.

A tender-hearted preacher, the Rev.
S. H. Patterson of San Francisco, who
was on his way to a war co—operation
conference in Chicago, saved the life of
a tiny humming bird and forgot all about
the war conference. He had just left
his hotel in Chicago when he found the
bird on the sidewalk. The warmth of
his hands revived it, so he took it up to
his room, nursed it back to life with
hourly feedings of honey and water for
several days and took it home with him.
The war conference had gone on without
him.

Back in San Francisco, the Rev. Mr.
Patterson glassed in his porch at con—
siderable expense, ﬁlled it with ﬂowering
plants and let the humming bird enjoy
life amid natural surroundings.

Proclaims Kindness Week

OLLOWING the example of his pred-
ecessors for the past twenty-ﬁve
years, Governor Saltonstall of Massachue
setts ofﬁcially designated Sunday, April
19, as Humane Sunday and the ensuing
week as Be Kind to Animals Week.

The recognition of Humane Sunday
and Be Kind to Animals Week now ob-
served the world over, was originally
suggested twenty—seven years ago by our
own Massachusetts Society for the Pre—
vention of Cruelty to Animals, now in
its seventy—ﬁfth year. It has been our
Society, also, that has led in national
humane legislation, which has been cop-
ied largely by practically every State in
the Union.

Following the lead of George T. An-
gell, more than eight million children in
this country have been gathered into
small humane groups which have had
awakened and fostered in their minds
the great principles of justice, fair play
and kindness toward every form of life.
These are the same principles for which
America is ﬁghting today with the ideal
of ending race prejudice, intolerance,
lawlessness, anarchy and cruelty.

I, therefore, am glad to designate
April 19, as HUMANE SUNDAY, and
the week of April 20-25, as BE KIND
TO ANIMALS WEEK, and urge our
people to observe the occasion, and par-
ticularly request that teachers in all our
schools observe a Humane Day with
appropriate exercises.

War and Hunting

The other evening we had the pleasure
of listening to a group of outstanding
citizens discuss the topic of “War and
Youth.” One of the speakers, a Congre-
gational clergyman, who had served in
the United States Army in the last war,
related a most interesting story.

Before he went to war he had been an
enthusiastic hunter, and he never failed
to be thrilled when the hunting season
came around and he again could take
his gun and go to the woods. But upon
his return following the Armistice, after
all the gruesome sights and destruction,
he never again, even to this day, has felt
the slightest desire to kill any living
creature.

While we are almost afraid to make
this statement, it would nevertheless
look to us as if some good can come
from war.

On April 7 Governor Eugene Tal-
madge of Georgia issued a Proclamation
for “Humane Week,” April 20-25, 1942.

Seasonal Nostalgia

CALVIN WALKER

HEN the robins appear, and the

ﬁrst furltive blossoms of forsythia,
I begin to suffer from a strange nostal-
gia. Sometimes it is powerful, breaking
like an ocean wave; sometimes it is
gentle, as soothing as the strains of age-
less music. I get it, too, from a stretch
of ﬁeld, or a budding hillside, or a brook
in a canopy of awakening alder. Some—
times it creeps up over my desk, fur-
tively, elflike, out of the cacophonies of
heedless industry. And sometimes, in
the deep silence of the night, it betrays
the hand of sleep; entices it, longingly,
into remembered pathways.

But it is always there, poorly hidden,
awaiting some unexpected touch of mem-
ory. A touch such as I experienced in
an old barn on a New Hampshire hill—
side several months ago. It was the
odor, I think, that started it. That al-
most indescribable sweetness that ema—
nates from hay-ﬁlled bays and hoof-worn
stalls and wagon-scarred planking. A
sweetness that, through childhood mem-
ory perhaps, rivals the scent of a ﬁeld
of clover or a bed of flowering tobacco.

But there was more than that. Swal-
lows, scooping in and out on noiseless
glistening wings, were heralded by mul-
tiple squeaks of insatiable hunger. And,
against windows long since frosted with
dusty webs, enormous gray spiders hung
in sunny idleness. And to one side, their
sleek heads down-pressed in mutewatch-
fulness, a pair of gray-s champed a con-
templated meal.

Then it was that I remembered; re-
called, with almost sad nostalgia, inci-
dents of other days. Of “Bla-ckie,” with
her four sightless kitten-s, in a trampled
nest of the north bay. Of the docile
Jersey, “Lady,” in a special stall with
her groping, big-eyed calf. Of “John,”
the work horse, with his inﬁnite patience
and his drooping sleepy head; and
“Henry,” his teammate, temperamental
and lofty-headed. I remembered, too, the
racing of the dog “Peter” over dusty,
super-heated mows; a racing that, in his
Wild joyous barking, echoed our happy
cries. And, occasionally, at the high
window in the east peak, the precarious
climb to release a befuddled swallow in
her frantic efforts to regain freedom.

Then, later, as I went back into the
warm summer sunshine; went out,
slowly, into a ﬁeld alive with skimming
swallows and fumbling bees, the nostal-
gia faded. As if a curtain had been
drawn across memory, I forgot it all;
left it there, thinly hidden, until some
new passing fragment should give it life
again.

mane Education Society in your will.

Care of Animals Works Miracle with City Boys

IVAL McPEAK

OYS become gentle in the grooming
of an animal, when they have been
cruel to their companions, and then

grow to be kindly and co-operative in liv—
ing with companions. This is one of the
many quiet miracles of changed human
nature that takes place every summer at
Agassiz Village. This Village is the
summer country community maintained
by the Burroughs Newsboys Foundation
on the hilly shores of Lake Thompson
in West Poland, Maine. It is the gift
of Mr. and Mrs. Maximilian Agassiz in
memory of his father, Alexander Agassiz.

Kindness to creatures of ﬁeld and wood
and sky at Agassiz Village is not en—
forced by penalties or taught by preach-
ment and regimentation. It is just
naturally a part of the life there.

To more than a thousand city boy‘s—
chieﬂy newsboys, bootblacks and street
vendors—the mere daily sight of sheep
and lambs, cows and calves, doves and
their young, ducks and ducklings, geese
and gosl-ings, roaming through the Vil-
lage, introduces them to a new set of
values. The boys see the care and kind-
ness that the mother bestows on her
young, and with like care and kindness
they attend to the needs of domestic
animals, keep bird-houses in good condi-
tion, and even desist from catching the
ﬁsh in the duck pond.

The wildest and roughest of young—

sters have hidden resources of beauty
and kindliness in them that need only
happy and wholesome living to bring to
the top. So believes Harry E. Burroughs,
founder and president of the Foundation,
who gives up his law practice during
the summer to personally direct Agassiz
Village.

As an instance, he rel-ates that one
time when a rainstorm came up sud-
denly, several little fellows rushed out
with raincoats under their arms, and,
unmindful of the fact that they them-
selves were soaked, ran to the various
animals, covering them with coats to
keep them dry. One boy massaged a
lamb to keep it warm.

And in Boston, several of the Founda-
tion boys feed and shelter pigeons in
the backyards of apartments and houses,
sometimes constructing mom for them
in the woodworking shop at the Founda-
tion.

Thus it is that the very boys con-
sidered by many to be unusually “tough”
and callous to the sufferings of lesser
creatures, come to exercise consideration
and care for others, both animals and
humans. It is such education, carried

on in such groups as the Burroughs
Newsboys Foundation, which, more than
laws and punishments, constitute the
greatest guarantee for the safety and
happiness of our animal friends.

 

PRACTICAL EDUCATION IN KINDNESS AT AGASSIZ VILLAGE, MAINE

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

“Patsy Ann” of Juneau Alaska
HARRIETT WIEGNER

twenty years she has met every ship

at the pier of one of the big steam-
ship lines at Juneau. Even though there
isn’t a ripple on the water or the sound
of a whistle—and, anyway, Patsy Ann
couldn’t hear the whistle, for she is now
stone deaf—she is always there when
the gangplank is lowered. Her past is
shrouded in mystery, and as for her an-
cestry, she has never revealed it. All any-
one can really tell about her is that eight-
een years ago she was a puppy on this
same dock.

“She was here the ﬁrst time I ever
came, and that was back in 1923,” says
the steward of one of the ships. “I asked
some men on the dock where she came
from, but nobody knew. She was a swell
pup —- always full of life and ready to
make friends.

“Well, they told me she stayed here
most of the time, and before they knew
it she grew up into a grand bull terrier.
She’d look at you with those brown eyes
of hers, and her black nose was always
smelling for friends.”

Because she had character and a gift
for making people like her, she was ac-
cepted by the ofﬁcers and crew of every
ship which docked at that pier. She lived
only for the excitement of meeting the
steamers.

Even the oldest employee on the dock
can’t tell how Patsy Ann got her name.
“She’s always been a beautiful dog. And
a good ﬁghter, too.” Everyone who talks
of Patsy Ann brags about her. “She
wouldn’t have any other dog‘on the dock
when a ship was coming in. First sound
of the whistle, she was off like a shot
with her ears and tail straight up, hunt-
ing all over the pier. If any cats came
around, they’d run and hide pretty fast.
But another dog wasn’t so easy to settle
with. Many’s the time there’s been more
than one good ﬁght before Patsy Ann
was ready to meet the ship. Sometimes
she’d be covered with scars but they just
made the crew think more of her, and so
she got lots to eat. They’d even bring
cooked meats and big slices of cake.”

For years she lived a life of adventure.
Then the Territory of Alaska decreed
that all dogs must have a license. For a
time Patsy Ann’s fate hung in the bal-
ance. She realized that something was
amiss. An ordinary dog wouldn’t have
known, but Patsy Ann wasn’t ordinary.
She made herself more appealing than
ever. She romped, she was loving, she
was a perfect dog and she knew she was
a perfect dog. She just let herself go.
Who could resist her? But the ofﬁcials
in Juneau were not impressed, and things
looked bad.

P ATSY ANN” is a dog. For nearly

Then the longshoremen on the dock
took a collection to buy a license. There
was money enough for the license and
for a beautiful collar besides, with Patsy
Ann’s name engraved on it. She wore it
proudly, until one day she appeared
without it. It must have been stolen.
Another collection was made, another
collar and license bought. Once more a
thief in the night. Again Patsy Ann used
her charm, and she could say more with
her eyes and tail than most people can
with words. Conferences were held. It
was decided by the ofﬁcials that because
of this dog’s record, she would be al-
lowed to rule the pier without a license.
Personality had won again.

Patsy Ann still rules. Her eyes light
with pleasure when she sees her favorite
foods brought to her by the stewards
who have been her friends so long, but
now she selects only the softest morsels,
for her teeth are almost gone. She tries
to show her thanks. Her barks, though,
are not so joyous as in former years and
her body is too stiff and heavy for wag-
ging.

The future for Patsy Ann sometimes
seems difficult. However, she bristles
with pride as she looks up and down the
pier to make sure no dog or cat is in
sight, and then, like the queen she is,
she waits for the gangplank to be low-
ered. After all, she is the only dog in
Alaska privileged to live without a li—
cense. And this Patsy Ann has achieved
on the strength of her own personality.
She is now a distinguished citizen of
Juneau.

Putting Birds 0n the Map“

JASPER B. SINCLAIR

OME of our ﬁrst settlers must have

had a genuine liking for birds. They
named a few American towns after our
feathered friends.

The eagle, national emblem of the
United States almost since the republic’s
beginning, leads all the rest of the birds
in the matter of place names. A trio of
examples is supplied by Eagle Rock in
California, Eagle Grove in Iowa and
Eagle Pass in Texas.

There is a Kingﬁsher in Oklahoma
and a Goose Creek in Texas. There is a
Blackduck in Minnesota and a Black
Hawk in South Dakota.

Pennsylvania has a Birdsboro and
California a Crow’s Landing and a Bird’s
Landing—which have all the ear marks
of airports for our feathered friends.
Even Minnesota’s Red Wing can be in-
cluded among the nation’s bird towns.

A couple of mythical birds also have
their place on the map. Georgia has a
Griffin, while Arizona and Illinois can
both claim a Phoenix as a reminder of
the legendary bird that supposedly rose
from its own ashes every ﬁve hundred
years.

By way of variety, there is a Swan
Lake in the Nevada desert country, a
Goose Lake in California, and an Eagle
Crag in New Mexico.

New Jersey has its own tribute. It is
the town of Audubon, name-sake of the
great naturalist and painter of the birds
of America—the ﬁnest publicity agent
the birds had in the early days of our
nation. . .

Beetles are undoubtedly the strongest

American or bald eagle been
so forcibly brought home to
us as at present in the midst
of our nation-wide program

Trumpeter Swan in Danger
LAURA ALICE BOYD

THE trumpeter swan, which has been
increasing in numbers, is again en-
dangered because of the plans of the U.
S. Army to establish an artillery range
where the bird has responded to the
efforts of conservation ofﬁcials.

This bird has been officially designated
as the largest migratory waterfowl in
North America but it no longer makes
the long ﬂights from its former breed-
ing grounds within the Arctic Circle to
the warm coast of Texas. Once an
abundant bird, the numbers dwindled
until the species was reported extinct
during the early part of this century.
Then a few birds were discovered in
the region of Yellowstone Park, and ef-
forts were made to restore the species.

The success which had attended this
work may be judged by a recent report
sent to the Secretary of the Interior,
Harold L. Ickes, by a joint committee
of the Fish and Wildlife Service and the
National Park Service which has been
working on this project. This report
states that at the present time there are
at least 211 of these huge birds at the

uge in Montana and at Yellowstone Na-
tional Park. Last year the count showed
190 birds which marked a distinct in-
crease from the 33 birds reported in
1934, when systematic counts were
begun.

The trumpeter is a very large bird
with a wing spread of seven feet, ten
inches. It is somewhat quarrelsome and
a fearless ﬁghter when aroused. When
hatched the cygnets are covered with a
sooty-gray down which soon changes to
feathers of the same color. These are
gradually replaced by white feathers but
the change often requires a year’s time.
The bill is entirely black. Vegetable
matter forms the main article of diet.
Seeds and roots of aquatic plants are
easily obtained because the long neck
enables the bird to reach food at the
bottom of streams and shallow pools
without diving into the water.

Swans are ancient birds. Aristotle
says of them in his “Historia Animal-
ium,” “Swans are web-footed and live
near pools and marshes; they ﬁnd their
food with ease, are good tempered, are
fond of their young and live to a green
old age.” Legend says that Richard
Coeur de Lion introduced these birds to
Britain when he returned from wars on
the continent.

Horses and International

Friendship
NORMAN C. SCHLICHTER

N Potter county, Pennsylvania, one

may see horses known as Clay Ham-
bletonians that symbolize international
friendship.

In 1852 Ole Bull, the famed Violinist,
was so cordially welcomed upon his ap-
pearance at Williamsport, Pennsylvania,
that he decided to set up a colony of
his fellow countrymen thereabouts.

He bought a large tract of wooded
land in the central Pennsylvania moun—
tain region, and in September of that
year eight hundred of his fellow Nor-
wegians came over to join him in the
new settlement. Farming was to be the
ﬁrst way of making a living.

Henry Clay, who was his friend, gave
Bull a thoroughbred stallion and brood
mare, and blooded cattle so as to insure
the ﬁnest kind of livestock for the new-
comers to our country.

The experiment lasted only a few
years, and the new Americans scattered
to distant parts, but today the ﬁne strain
of those Clay horses still persists in
stock owned by persons who live in the
Vicinity of Bull’s mountain colony.

Pennsylvania did a gracious thing a
few years ago by setting aside this
mountain area as the Ole Bull Forest
Monument. It is to be a perpetual park
in memory of this great man and his
brave attempt to better the lot of his
own people.

How few Americans know that our
ﬂag and the Norwegian flag float on
every clear day over the ruins of a great
castle which Bull started to build! Now
that we are allied with Norway in war
this shrine of international goodwill has
a new signiﬁcance.

A Horse Valhalla

BLANCHE M.cKNIGHT

DO you know that aging horses in
Uncle Sam’s service, who are no
longer ﬁt for active duty, may be sent
to one of the remount depots in the
United States, where they can spend
their declining days in equine luxury?

This has been made possible by an

 

edict of the War Department which pro-
vides that condemned horses or mules
of conspicuous merit need not be sold
or destroyed, but may be retired to re-
mount pastures to end their days.

The three remount depots are located
at Front Royal, Virginia; Fort Robin-
son, Nebraska, and Fort Reno, Okla-
homa. With their wide pastures and
ample hay they offer a haven where a
few of these deserving veterans may be
supported at little expense.

In the select company enjoying the
grasslands at Front Royal, which serves
the eastern half of the United States, are
the beautiful thoroughbreds, “Jeff” and
“Kidron,” wartime mounts of Gen. John
J. Pershing. Kidron, a French thorough—
bred, is now 32 years old, and Jeff, a
Virginia Halfbred, is 31.

On July 14, 1919, Kidron was the
proud charger at the head of the Paris
Victory Parade, down the Champs Elysees
and under the Arc de Triomphe. Jeff,
although much larger and heavier than
the average hunters or jumpers seen in
show rings, during the years immedi-
ately following the war was a consistent
ribbon winner in New York, Pennsyl-
vania, District of Columbia and Vir-
ginia. Jeff was a gift to General Persh—

ing from the Jefferson Foreign Post of
the American Legion, and was ridden by
him in the grand Victory parade in New
York City in 1919. Now these two fa-
mous “soldier horses,” tried and true,
are taking life easy. When they feel
like it they go out to pasture, but if

“JEFF,” A FAVORITE MOUNT OF GENERAL PERSHING

they prefer to remain in their “spic and
span” stalls, each equipped with an in—
dividual cake of salt and a watering
trough, they do so.

At Fort Robinson and Fort Reno, as
at Front Royal, there are many old-
timers in the horse kingdom who are
taking life easy after an eventful career
in the United States Army, and who
deserve Uncle Sam’s blessing, “Well
done, thou good and faithful servants.”

A common form of cruelty to animals
reported by Humane Societies is neglect
of saddle sores in horses rented out by
riding stables. Sore backs, sore shoul-
ders and sore necks covered up by sad-
dles, harnesses and collars are not only a
source of a great deal of cruelty but also
the cause of more days on “sick report”
than any other ailment of horses.

worms in one day. This is forty—one
per cent more than its own weight.
Young robins will eat more than half
their own weight daily.

Woodland Drummer
Mariorie Hunt Pettit

The proud cock grouse, in brown and buff,
With beating wing and swelling ruff,
Drums out his challenge, understood

By all his feathered brotherhood;

in guarded code he spreads the word—

A message felt as much as heard.

Like some slow-throbbing pulse it comes—
The rhythm of the woodland drums;

A monotone of leaf and loam

As steady as a metronome

Attends this system of address—

The “grapevine” of the wilderness.

Sage Hens Increasing
JOHN KNOX ODELL

LD settlers in various parts of the
Northwest recall that entire settle—
ments were saved from starvation, in
those early days, by sage hens alone.
These hardy birds, known to hunters as
“cock—of—the-plains,” and largest of the
North American species of grouse, are
about one-third smaller than the Euro-
pean “cock-of—the-woods.”

The sage hen was once among the most
abundant of all wild bird game on the
plains of the upper Columbia River
country, living in ﬂocks and feeding so
much on the Artemisia (sage brush)
foliage, as to acquire the name “sage
hen” from the faint sage ﬂavor of the
meat during the late spring, when these
birds eat the tender green sage tips and
blossoms. But sometimes, through scar—
city of their usual food at that season of
the year, the ﬂesh became almost too
bitter to be eaten. The pioneers, how—
ever, were only too glad to put up with
that diet rather than to be without any
food.

Yet sage hens, which have been on the
closed game lists in the upper Columbia
and the Yakima Valley for more than
twenty years, are now increasing steadily
in those parts of the State of Washing-
ton, according to game warden reports.

Hunters have noticed them. in many
sections of the Valley, but the greatest
gains in 1941 appeared to be in the upper
end of Yakima County, especially in the
Badger Pocket and Kittitas districts.
Some farmers in Badger Pocket reported
sage hens were so numerous that they
kept potato ﬁelds clear of potato bugs
and other insects during the past year.

There is no immediate prospect that
the hunting season will be opened on
these useful and naturally attractive
birds. For, when given a chance to mul-
tiply for a few years more, it is aﬂ‘irmed
that they may, once again, become one
of the favorite and most common game
birds of the Northwest.

Cardinal Characteristics

ALVIN M. PETERSON

Photograph by the Author

charming and lovable characteris-

tics with no bad ones to offset the
good. It is, in fact, one of the prettiest,
most valuable and likable of all birds.
It is conﬁding, gentle, patient, digniﬁed,
well—bred, hardy and not easily thrown
off balance.

First, I would take note of itslhardi—
neass. Birds with bright feathers often
are southern bird‘s, yet here we have one
of the gaudy ones that has extended its
range northward and now is to be found
in the most northern parts of the United
States winter and summer alike. In other
words, the cardinal is a permanent resi—
dent wherever found. We see it fully as
often in winter as in summer, and it does
not mind temperatures as low as twenty
or even thirty degrees below zero. It
lives mainly upon weed seeds and Wild
berries in winter.

Watch this bird when it comes to your
food tray or feeding station for a bite to
eat in winter and you will ﬁnd that it
never seems in a hurry. The ﬁrst hint
one usually gets that it is about is its
most common note, a musical “cheep,”
that reminds one of the “chip” calls or
alarms of several of our sparrows. As
likely as not, you ﬁnd it perched in a tree,
vine, or on the wire of the fence, where
it looks calmly about, pump-s its tail and
waits for the proper time before having

THIS pretty red bird has many

a bite to eat. If there are other birds
about, it also waits before dining, and,
when disturbed, it ﬂies off and as calmly
waits until the coast is clear. All its
movements seem deliberate and not jerky
or nervous like those of many birds.

Nor must we overlook its amiability.
Many birds are aggressive and quarrel-
s-ome. They not only keep other species
at a respectable distance when eating but
other individuals of their own species
also. They dart at them, scold and sput—
ter, and are not easily satisﬁed. But not
so the cardinal. Seldom will you see it
darting for another bird, and, should it
do so, you may be sure it will be no more
than a gentle hint or reminder and not a
vicious stab. It believes in letting other
birds alone and in being a good neighbor.

Both in character and disposition it is
a well-bred and superbly poised bird. It
also is a noted songster. When singing,
it usually chooses a prominent perch,
often near the top of a tall tree, and in
this respect is like the brown thrasher.
Its song is loud and varied and may be
heard a long distance. Those who have

it for a neighbor must often listen to its
music, for how can one remain deaf to
such a charming and inspiring song?
Best of all, it begins to tune up in late
winter, and its early song is a sure sign
King Winter is losing his grip and that
spring is just around the corner.

What this world-wide war is meaning
to numberless animals, those still used
in spite Of all the tanks and planes, and
the cattle, sheep and swine and fowl Of
the over-run lands, we shall never know.
The mystery of animal suffering is one
of life’s unsolved and insoluble problems.

It is difﬁcult to believe that the num-
ber of robins in the United States is
exceeded by the redstart, oven-bird and
red-eyed Vireo. The robin‘ is the bird we
see so constantly about our homes. These
other birds spend most of their time in
more crowded and mountainous sections.

In the observance of World Humane
Day, the Burma (India) Humanitarian
League, at its recent annual meeting
started a new endeavor to abolish the
animal sacriﬁce in the Kali Temple at
Ingalone. Support also was given to a
new organization for the protection Of
bullocks and buffaloes.

The Massachusetts Society for the
Prevention Of Cruelty tO Animals, c0-
operating with the other humane organ—
izations of the State and the Massachu-
setts Committee on Public Safety, will
soon have for public distribution the
necessary directions and regulations for
the care of animals in case of air raids.

Dr. Rowley wishes he could acknowl-
edge all the beautiful Christmas and
New Year cards that have been sent him.
He deeply appreciates this kindness and
devoutly wishes he could write a letter
to each Of those who have so graciously
remembered him. All they have wished
him Of happiness and cheer he heartily
returns to each Of them.

 

Abraham Lincoln

A thousand years hence, no story, no
tragedy, no epic poem will be ﬁlled with
greater wonder, or be followed by man-
kind with deeper feeling than that
which tells of his life and death.

HENRY WATTERSON at Algonquin Club,
Boston, Feb. 12, 1903

His heart was as great as the world,
but there was no room in it to hold the
memory of a wrong.

RALPH WALDO EMERSON

He is our ‘Father Abraham’ belonging
to us, his fellow-citizens, for ideals, for
inspiration, and for affectionate regard;
but he belongs now also to all mankind,
for he has been canonized among the
noblest of the world’s heroes.

GEORGE HAVEN PUTNAM

In his life he was a great American.
He is an American no longer. He is one
Of those giant ﬁgures, of whom there
are very few in history, who lose their
nationality in death. I wonder
whether I will be forgiven for saying
that George Washington was a great
American, but Abraham Lincoln belongs
tO the common people of every land.

LLOYD GEORGE

Washington’s name is, and forever
will remain, the priceless heritage of all
Americans. He was the Father of his
Country, and had that loftiness of char-
acter, that purity Of purpose, that solid-
ity of judgment, which command the
admiration Of the world. But one other
name, that of Lincoln, is linked with his
in the affections of his countrymen.

HENRY WADE ROGERS

The Keenest Pain

THERE is a ﬁne passage in one of
Zangwill’s books. He describes a
Temple Open to the winds where stands
a wondrous statue with a face that is
beautiful in its eternal calm.‘The winds
from far and near sweep round the pal-
ace laden with the pain of the world,
but the statue hears them not; eternal
calm is on its face.

Until one day its ears are Opened, and
it hears the message Of the wind—it
hears the cry of the world’s vast woe.
And the pain Of the statue is greater
than the pain Of the whole world, for it
hears but it cannot help.

Keen as is the pain of a thousand
hearts at the sufferings that they know
day by day are laid upon the patient and
defenseless animals that man has
brought within his power, keener still,
and harder far to bear, would be the
pain could we lift no hand, speak nO
word to lessen those sufferings. We,
thank God, can act. We can speak at least.
in behalf of kindness and justice. We can
write the letter that may move someone
stronger than we to utter his voice. And
yet, more to be pitied than Zangwill’s
moveless statue with the cry Of the
world’s pain ringing through its heart,
is the man or woman who can hear that
cry and in selﬁsh indifference let it ring,
on unheeded.

Abraham Lincoln’s place in history is
assured. All the symbols of this world’s
admiration are his. He is embalmed in
song, recorded in history, eul-ogized in.
panegyric, cast in bronze, sculptured in.
marble, painted on canvas, enshrined in.
the hearts Of his countrymen, and lives:
in the memories Of mankind.

AN ORNAMsENTAL FEEDING—HOUSE WHICH
ATTRACTS VISITORS FROM THE WILD

 

Web-Footed Wanderer

EVA WILLES WANGSGAARD

UCKY” is a pet duck owned by Kenneth Soren—
sen, eleven-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Hy
Sorensen of 714 Emerson Avenue, Salt Lake City. And
to adapt Bliss Carman’s line to the occasion, “There
is something in her nature that is mostly vagabond.”
It seems that even webbed feet get the itch for the
open road and the long hill. Certainly Ducky’s do.
If Kenneth could stay at home all day, perhaps he
could prevent the wander-lust from conquering his pet,
but Kenneth must go to school. And a wandering
duck can cover a lot of distance during a session of
school. If it weren’t for Kenneth’s other pet “Skippy,”
the terrier, some day the boy might come home to
ﬁnd that he had no duck at all. But Skippy is not an
irresponsible puppy, he’s a grown dog of a good six
summers, and he knows what a dog’s duties to his
master are and assumes them without the telling.
When Ducky’s urge to “go places” takes her from
the yard, she sometimes goes far before Skippy misses
her. But as soon as the dog realizes that the duck is
gone, he is off to track her down. The rules of life
are simple from Skippy’s point of View. He knows

  

 

nothing of duck psychology and of Ducky’s need for
a pond in which to swim and of other ducks with
which to quack. He knows only that Kenneth expects
to ﬁnd his pets safe and at home when he returns
from school. So he always ﬁnds Ducky and, catching
her in tender jaws, he carries her safely back into
the yard as if she were a kitten and he her mother.

Ducky submits to the indignity of being carried
tabby—fashion without a struggle. Indeed, she acts as
if she enjoys the ride home, because it isn’t long until
the lure of a hidden pond behind the long hill becomes
again irresistible and the three-cornered feet go pad~
dingeoff once more. Thus Skippy has to be on the
alert and his sleuthing job must be often repeated.

IN each of the following sentences the names of three

birds are hidden. Can you ﬁnd them all?

1. When Hal began netting 'ﬁsh we saw him pull
in netful after netful of beauties.

2. He dumped them on a long rack, letting escape
wee ﬁsh too small to keep, and I remembered the
knuckles I skinned on it one day.

3. Dorothy took him his sandwiches and pipe,
remaining to watch, so he put his tunic on Dorothy
and put her on the sheltered side of the boat.

4. You can’t keep lovers apart, and she manages

to wheedle out of him what she wants regardless of
his wants.

Wildlife and Trapping

RUEL traps—and there are many in-

genious varieties — are constantly
in use by the hundreds of thousands.
Trappers, very often young boys and
girls earning a little extra money, some-
times fail to show the slightest interest
in their captives’ suffering. While we
are not concerned with the ﬁnal disposi-
tion of the fur pelt, we are vitally inter—
ested in the manner and method em-
ployed in capturing the live animal.

Many gruesome experiences, too hor-
rible to repeat here, have come to life
during the years, and only recently
Walter J. Schoonmaker, president of the
New York State Nature Association,
told of his own experiences in connec-
tion with the ﬁnding of a skunk caught
in a trap. Upon investigation, it devel-
oped that a boy had set the trap but,
upon ﬁnding a live skunk in it, became
afraid to approach too closely, and left
the animal to suffer until death released
it.

News articles of late tell of renewed
activities in trapping and hunting of
fur bearers—an interest brought about
as a result of war curtailment of im-
ported fur. What is being done to elim—
inate some of these cruelties? The
American Humane Association main—
tains a wildlife department which offers
prizes for humane traps and constantly
attempts to obtain better treatment for
all wild creatures.

The New York State Nature Associa-
tion is doing a splendid job by the crea—
tion of real sanctuaries where no hunt-
ing or trapping is permitted but where
nature lovers may come and enjoy the
wildlife of our ﬁelds and forests by
photography, sculpting, sketching, or
just looking at them.

The Anti-Steel Trap League and the
Emergency Conservation Committee and
others are also working toward the same
goal—but much remains to be done. We
are glad to believe that on our great fur
farms, where thousands of fur-bearing
animals are raised yearly, humane de-
struction is usually employed when the
time comes to harvest the fur crop.

Clear-cut and precise bulletins setting
forth a program, in which all interested
humanitarians could participate, should
be made available. Sincere humanita-
rians cannot stand aside and “let George
do it,” when it comes to wildlife protec—
tion; and, as someone so aptly has put
it, let us plan “to give to wildlife of our
ﬁeld and forest the same protection af—
forded domestic animals.”

Our readers are urged to clip from
“Our Dumb Animals” various articles
and request local editors to republish.

Teach Kindness by Example

HILDREN learn best by the example

set for them by their elders, and

there is no more effective way of teaching
them than to be kind to dumb animals.

There is a man in my community who
owns a ﬁne dog. The man, however, has
a vicious temper and I have often seen
him pulling and jerking on the dog’s leash
for no apparent reason at all. The other
day I saw his small son walking the dog
and doing the same thing. When I told
the boy that it was wrong to treat a dumb
animal that way, he replied, quite sin—
cerely:

“Oh, it’s all right! Daddy does it, too.”

It is perfectly natural for a child to
Wish to emulate his elders, particularly
his parents. In households Where there
are pets, it is well to bear this constantly
in mind. If a child hears a grown—up talk—
ing harshly to a dog or cat, or mistreat-
ing the animal, it is apt to accept such
action as being perfectly normal.

There is an old saying to the effect that
“imitation is the highest form of ﬂat-
tery.” In teaching impressionable young-
sters to be kind to their pets by example,
we are ﬂattering not only ourselves, but

are playing an important role in charac-
ter building and in fostering humane
ideals among those to whom we must
some day “throw the torch.” T. J. M.

The Mule Is Back

It does not surprise anyone familiar
with mules to learn that these wonder-
ful animals are back in force to help
win this war.

Popular conception has it that the
mule is a contrary, stubborn and often
very disagreeable creature, but critics
fail to take into consideration some of
the animal’s sterling qualities.

Under ﬁre, for instance, the mule is
calm where the horse often loses its
head and runs wild. The mule is sure-
footed and very wise. Heat and rain,
mud or snow never interfere with his
work.

Animaldom, quoting Time magazine,
points out that 4,500,000 mules are com—
ing into their own. Farmers, unable to
buy tractors, are again acquiring mules,
and the army, which now has 7,000,
wants 15,000 more.

The mule is back, and we can be cer-
tain that he will accredit himself with
honor and glory.

LoveforSale
Anna M. Priestly

We live in a city apartment,
High over a busy street;
And, down at the nearest corner,
Where the lines of traffic meet
Is a place that is fascinating,
With "Pet Shop” over the door,
Where always a dozen puppies
Are rollicking over the floor.

There are crowds around its window
At any time of the day,
Watching those puppies caper
And tussle at their play——
A rich man, a beggar, a youngster
With nose pressed flat on the glass,
A pair of tittering school girls,
A sailor boy and his lass.

They say love cannot be purchased,
But we know we could purchase there
Enough real love and affection
To bankrupt a millionaire.
It is hard to get by that window,
But we keep on passing it up—
For life in a city apartment
Wouldn’t be fair to a pup.

The Dog Who Engaged a Cab
ELMA M. PETERSON

T is in Hellerup, a pleasant suburb of

Copenhagen, Denmark, that the wire-
haired terrier, “Bolle,” basks in the
understanding care of his adoring master
and mistress. Should a glimpse of sea
through the foliage lure you into the
quiet, tree-lined paths of the Lille-
strandvej, you would probably see him
trotting contentedly home after his daily
dip or, if you showed the slightest in—
clination to turn in as you passed his
doorway, hear a sharp, quick bark from
his favorite lounging place on the wide
window sill in his master’s study.

In usual terrier style, Bolle listens
intently when talked to and, with eyes
aglow and tail awag, succeeds in making
himself understood, not only by those
familiar with his habits, but by stran-
gers as well. There is one quite out—
stand-ing example of his ability in this
respect.

One evening his master and mistress,
on a leisurely drive about Copenhagen,
stopped at a park. As they strolled
through the green-bordered paths, Bolle
dashed delightedly here and there among
the trees and bushes, drinking from a
clear pool or joining in the playful antics
of other canines. When they were ready
to leave the park, Bolle was nowhere
to be found. After extensive searching
they were obliged to go on without him.

It was one o’clock when they were
aroused by the telephone. The voice at
the other end of the line informed them
that he was a cab-driver.

“BOLLE”

“A dog with your name on his collar
came to my cab,” he said, “and seem-s to
insist upon being taken somewhere.”

The distance was rather great but you
may be sure he was told to bring the dog
home.

And that is how Bolle, the terrier,
with the cool reasoning of a human, en-
gaged a cab and brought about a happy
reunion with his master and mistress.

Source of Inspiration
MARY AGNES COLVILLE

0NE of the best loved companions of
the young composer, Stephen Col-
lins Foster, was a very beautiful tor-
toise—shell cat. Young Stephen would
often take time from his beloved music
to bestow special attentions on this
prized feline chum. Many, it is said,
were the tempting and
nutritious morsels that
the lad foraged from the
kitchen of his home, or
saved out generously
from his own treats for
this particularly favored
pet.

Mrs. Foster, young
Stephen’s mother, in a
letter to another son
wrote that “Thanks to
Stephen’s care—Kitty
looks sleek and nice.”
The young lad, a com-
poser at the age of thir-
teen, shared many of his
happiest moments with
his cat, curled up to-
gether on the hearth-
rug before the leaping
ﬂames.

Later on a handsome
dog, presented by a
friend of the Foster

June, 1942

family, became an inseparable companion
of Stephen Foster. The composer was
gratiﬁed that his dog should make warm
friends with all the neighboring children,
and he used to regard it as a pleasant
relaxation from his music to watch his
ﬁne pet romping happily with the chil-
dren and joining in their games.

When misfortunes saddened Foster’s
life, the dog remained his dearest friend.
After its passing, the famous song, “Old
Dog Tray,” which enjoyed great popu-
larity, was written by Stephen Foster
as a memorial to the faithfulness and
sincerely affectionate nature of this
cherished companion.

A few years afterward, Foster was
very devoted to another canine, a lively
Scotch terrier of loyal traits, who was
given to him as a gift to replace the
loss of the other dog.

Of the sensitive dreamer type, there
was ever a place reserved in Foster’s
kindly thoughts for God’s dumb crea-
tures.

In his compelling songs which for
years have charmed people alike from
humble cottage to pretentious mansion,
there are different references to the
small creatures of the earth. As they
were to many another destined to ﬁll an
enduring niche in the halls of fame, ani-
mals and birds were a source of much
inspiration to Stephen Foster.

One of the most amazing qualiﬁcations
of a Seeing Eye dog is that it protects
its master from overhead dangers as well
as from hazards on the ground. While
observing the approach of vehicles and
people, and the roughness of the walk,
it simultaneously judges the man’s
height. It actually leads its master un—
der obstacles that clear his head by a
matter of less than an inch.

Fox Hunt
Mary Sinton Leitch

What was that wintry voice I heard?
It was a fox's crying!

In the chill moonlight eerie, weird,
An echo is replying.

The telltale snow within the wood
Had soon betrayed my quarry.
So still in his warm furs he stood,

My aim could not miscarry.

Startled he saw me raise my gun,
But with it cocked and ready

I could not shoot: I let him run:
My hand was too unsteady.

I watched those nimble, buoyant feet
And knew that I could never

Destroy such beauty lithe and fleet
Like wind upon the river.

I saw him move like blowing grass,
The rhythm of a measure,

With moonlight shadows merge and pass.
That memory is my treasure.

And though a Sportsman’s shame I felt
To stand transfixed and gaping,

l bagged far more than brush or pelt
While Reynard was escaping.

In Defense of Armadillos
J . C A S E Y

UCH has been said in defense of

various phases of our wild life,
but I have noticed very little concerning
one of the most highly interesting and
unique of our Southwest fauna, the
armadillo, and which is fast being ruth-
lessly murdered to extinction.

These strange creatures have two
claims to fame—their peculiar shell, and
their equal peculiarity of being the
only known mammal that gives birth to
litters of four—always of the same sex,
either all males or all females, but never
a mixed lot.

Because every part of their bodies,
except breast and abdomen, are encased
in hard, protective armor-like shells, the
armadillos are known as “animal battle—
ships.” The shells have distinct bands,
ranging in number from nine to fourteen
according to the species, and are black
with pale yellowish markings.

It is because of the pretty shells that
the armadillos are being so needlessly
slaughtered. Baskets, lampshades and
other hideous novelties are made from
the shells, and often the entire bodies
are mounted. And since biological sup-
ply houses pay well for the embryos,
mothers with unborn babies are hunted
out particularly—since their shells can
be used and their young sold. It is one of
the requirements from the supply houses
that the young be placed in the preserva-
tive while they are still alive—thus in-
suring more perfect specimens.

In some places where the shells are
made into novelties, the harmless little
animals are killed in a most inhuman

 

THE BBMALE ARMADILLO DRINKS WHILE THE MALE
SERVES AS LOOKOUT

 

manner. Since they are incapable of
making a sound, other than pig-like
grunts, while being split down the
abdomen and their Vitals cruelly torn
out, they undergo this extreme torture
in silence, except for agonized grunts.

Some people have wrongly accused
armadillos of destroying quail and tur—
key nests, eating the eggs and young;
however, several noted naturalists know
that this is a mistake. Armadillos do
NOT bother birds’ nests, neither do they
eat young chickens.

Only recently has the true value of

armadillos as destroyers of noxious in-
sects and rattlesnakes been recognized.
They are especially valuable for their
destruction of the tiny red ants which
attack bob—white quail just as the young
are emerging from the shells. And while
it is true, rattlesnakes have been found
in the burrows of armadillos, it is also
true that on numerous occasions it is a
known fact that these armored animals
kill rattlesnakes.
‘ Their main food consists of carrion,
ants, snails, snakes, grub worms, grass-
hoppers, locusts and many other insects
that are harmful to plant life. It has
been said the armadillos destroy so much
grass—surely they are entitled to a few
grass roots in exchange for the val-
uable service rendered by destroying so
many injurious insects!

These queer animals usually remain
out of sight during daytime—in their
underground homes where they store
food and give birth to their young. They
are very shy and easily frightened, are
nearsighted, but have a remarkably keen
sense of smell. They are very ﬂeet of
foot, regardless of their clumsy looking
appearance, and will run at the ﬁrst sign
of trouble, but if cornered will roll them-
selves into a tight ball, and draw in
their heads like turtles.

Surely these strange animals deserve
a better fate than being cruelly mur-
dered just because they have a pretty
shell and have no means of protection.

The Bible on Birdnesting

Are you surprised to learn that the
Bible has something to say concerning
birdnesting? It would seem that some
people in those far-off days were just as
thoughtless or just as deliberately cruel
about robbing birds’ nests as people of
today sometimes are.

If you will look up Deuteronomy 22 :6,
you will read, “If a bird’s nest chance to
be before thee in the way in any tree, or
on the ground, whether they be young
ones or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the
young or upon the eggs, thou shalt not
take the dam with the young.” A. I. T.

Veterinary Column

1. Question: Within the last few days
our dog has been acting like an old man
with rheumatism. He is a spaniel, four
years old. We notice that he walks with
a stiff gait, especially after he has been
lying down; and sometimes he actually
whines and yelps as though he was in
pain. We are quite certain that he has
not been injured, although he was out
quite late in a rainstorm four days ago.
Is it possible for dogs to have rheuma-
tism?

Answer: Quite often dogs, even young
dogs, do have attacks of muscular rheu—
matism. The symptoms of such a con—
dition are Similar to those you describe.
The best treatment is to provide plenty
of warmth, even use a heat lamp for
half an hour twice a day, and give one
or two aspirin tablets daily. An attack
of this sort usually lasts about a week.

2. Question: We have a nine-months—
Old male cat we wish to have castrated.
Is there any risk to the life of the ani—
mal during such an operation? We are
very fond of this animal and do not want
to lose him.

Answer: Most veterinarians use an
anesthetic, usually ether, for such an
Operation. There is always a slight risk

to man or beast, when put under the in~
ﬂuence of a general anesthetic. The main
risk in the young animal is that of im-
proper pre-operative care. An animal
must be dieted twelve and preferably
eighteen hours before giving it a gen-
eral anesthetic.

3. Question: We have a pedigreed
Last
spring she had a litter of mongrel pup—
pies. We now Wish to have some pure
cocker puppies, but a friend told us that
once the dog had mongrels she never
could have pure-bred puppies again. Is
this true?

Answer: This is a popular belief
among many people. However, it is bio—
logically impossible for the offspring of
tWO pure-bred parents to be mongrels.
If both the mother and father are pedi—
greed, and known to be of pure strain,
their offspring Will be pure strain, no
matter how many mongrel litters the
mother may have had.

4. Question: Is it possible to trim a
cat’s claws to prevent it from scratching
the furniture? .

Answer: It is possible to cut a cat’s
claws. However, such a thing is only
a temporary solution to your problem.
It is also rather a cruel thing to do, as
it removes a cat’s main weapon of de-
fense against any attack from other ani-
mals. It is temporary in that the claws
will become sharp again in about two
weeks (mainly by increased efforts to
sharpen them on anything available).

Animals on Stamps
EWEN x. PATTERSON

ITHIN recent times there has been
a great increase throughout the
world in the use of animal and bird
designs on postage stamps. Scores of
interesting and attractive stamps bear—
ing such designs have appeared, and
they provide fascinating life—like glimps-
es of some of the world’s rarest animals
and birds. Such stamps are of consider—
able educational value. A most instruc-
tive picture book of animals and birds
can be compiled from the many beauti-
ful designs that have already appeared.
Probably the most attractive animal
stamp that has appeared to date was one
issued a few years ago by the State of
Southern Rhodesia (Africa). Against a
background of dense jungle and the fa—
mous Zambesi Falls are shown life-like
illustrations of a giraffe, an elephant, a
lion and a Springbok. The latter is a
member of the antelope family noted for
its jumping powers.
Other beautiful animal stamps issued

in Africa include the South African half—

penny stamp, which pictures a close-up
View of the head of the noble springbok.
Another member of the antelope family
is depicted on the two-cent stamp of
Italian East Africa; this is the small,
graceful gazelle, a very active and swift
animal noted for its large, limpid eyes
and recurved antlers which grow largest
on the males. A delightful animal-bird
stamp of Africa is a one—cent stamp of
Liberia which pictures two elephants
and a ﬁne View of that amazing bird, the
toucan. Other African stamps show the
ostrich, the camel and the lion; one
issued by Mozambique shows that coun-
try’s deadliest snake, and it is believed
to be the only stamp ever issued any-
where in the world bearing the picture
of a dangerous snake.

Other beautiful animal-stamps that
have been issued over the last few years
include a Greenland stamp picturing the
polar bear, the largest of the species of
bear. A recent Newfoundland stamp
shows the fur-seal, which differs con-
siderably from the true seal in that its
limbs are less paddle—like While its ears
have small external lobes. A new stamp
of North Borneo also shows the rare

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

proboscis monkey, and
another depicts a rare
cockatoo of Borneo. One
of the last stamps issued
in Norway before the war
showed a beautiful pic-
ture of a reindeer against
a background of snow-
covered hills, while a
recent stamp of St. Pierre
et Miquelon shows New—
foundland d o gs wit h
sleigh. Birds are repre-
sented on several other
new stamps. A Falkland
Islands’ stamp shows an
upland goose; a Gilbert
Islands’ stamp shows the
frigate bird; and an Aus-
tralian stamp portrays
the famous kookaburra
(or laughing ja ck a s s)
bird.

Australia has issued
animal stamps showing
the unique platypus, kan-
garoo and koala bear. An—
other pleasing Australian
stamp bears a ﬁne picture
of a sheep; it was issued
in honor of the centenary
of the founding of the
Australian sheep indus-
try. India has also issued

A Quartet of Siamese Cats

Aristocrats of the cat family are these big—eyed
Siamese kittens, bred by Mrs. A. C. Davidson of
Elmira, N. Y. An old legend says that the Siamese cat
originated long ago When the feminine favorite of a
Chinese god asked for a very special and different
gift. The god blended the best points of many cats,
according to the legend, achieving what he called the
“Royal Siamese.”

Feb. 1942

 

E. L. VAN DYKE

 

a special series of attrac—
tive animal-stamps; these show horses,
bullocks and camels engaged in trans-
porting mail in various parts of India.

These are but a few of the animal and
bird stamps that have been issued
throughout the world—tiny scraps of
paper that pay tribute to the noble mem—
bers of the great animal kingdom.

Our Largest Rodent

The carpincho, or capybara as it is
more commonly known, is our largest
rodent. The animal is about four feet
long and two feet high when it reaches
its full growth, and it is much larger
than its relative, the guinea pig. Like
the guinea pig, the capybara has no tail.

These unusual animals live in South
America near lakes and rivers. Their
feet are partially webbed and they are
excellent swimmers.

When we think of rodents we gener-
ally picture an undesirable, destructive
animal such as a rat. However, the
capybara is gentle and harmless, even
attractive. Unfortunately the skin of this
animal is much in demand for the mak-
ing of gloves.

Insect life is enormous. Entomologists
have described 675,000 species in the
United States alone. It is estimated
there are more than 2,500,000 kinds of
insects in the world.

Iowa’s Wild Deer

WILLIS MEHANNA

During the past decade wild deer as
well as other wild life have increased in
Iowa owing to the adequate protection
given them. Deer in a wild state were at
one time nearly extinct in Iowa, but ani-
mals that are kept in deer parks, and
that were released or escaped, increased
the number of animals in the Wild
state so that in some areas they are
abundant. They range at Will from one
region to another. Deer like to migrate
to suitable environment from time to
time and their distribution through Iowa
is shown by the fact that the State Con-
servation Commission, Within the past
year, received reports of their presence
in almost every county.

In areas where they are not common
they attract much attention and farmers
do not mind the slight crop damage they
do since the farmer get-s a big thrill in
watching the deer as it goes bounding
through the ﬁelds. However, a herd of
deer can do considerable crop damage.

Prosecutions and heavy ﬁnes have been
levied from time to time against of-
fenders who killed deer illegally, and now
deer poaching is. done but little. Of
course deer have no great utility value
although they do eat noxious weed-s to
some extent. They are liked because of
their beauty, grace and innocence.

No Speed Limit
LAURA ALICE BOYD

ACH autumn as the birds wing their

way southward we marvel at the in-
stinct that guides them on their journey
and speculate as to how fast they ﬂy.

Hunters tell “tall tales” about the
speed of the duck that got away, and
there is some ground for their stories
when we know that canvas-backs and
teal are known to ﬂy at 50 to 55 miles
an hour. A pheasant’s best speed has
been ascertained to be 40 miles an hour
while a partridge travels at about 25
miles an hour.

Birds of prey, such as eagles and
hawks, have great ﬂying speed but not
for sustained flights over long distances.
They are able to stoop down upon their
victims with sudden bursts of speed
which in the case of the duck hawk, one
of the world’s fastest birds, has been
timed at between 160 and 180 miles an
hour. The eagle has been estimated as
:stooping at the rate of 120 miles, though
it does not ﬂy straightaway at that speed.

More data has been obtained on the
speed of homing pigeons than almost
any other birds, and so many romantic
.stories have been told about their prow-
ess in ﬂight that the general public cred-
its them with greater speed than facts
warrant. As a result of the many races
held among homing pigeons it has been
proved that their best speed is not more
than a mile a minute. Pigeons can rise
almost vertically and attain their maxi-
mum speed quickly.

The hummingbird, however, has real
pickup. High speed cameras have shown
that he ﬂies from a standing start at
45 miles an hour, which means that his
wings vibrate at the rate of 55-75 beats
.a second. Perhaps the fastest ﬂiers of all
the birds are, as their name suggests,
the swifts. So streamlined are these
birds that even their nostrils point back—
wards. An Asiatic species has been
estimated to ﬂy at the rate of possibly
220 miles an hour.

Such excessive speed for such small
creatures would be incredible were it
not for the fact that they are built for
speed and the breast muscles of a bird

are 100 times more powerful, relatively,
than those of a man.

“It is only 100 days from New Year’s
Day to the bluebird,” said the Old Far-
mer’s Almanac in 1876.

Purple martins make good neighbors.
They are insect—eating, tuneful, and
friendly. An elaborate martin house is
not necessary to attract them. An old

gourd suspended in a suitable place has

been known to attract the same faithful

pair season after season.

Canada Jays Come South
w. J . B A N K s

1RD lovers in the districts along the

United States-Canadian border from
the Great Lakes eastward will be on
the lookout this season for that bold
whistler of the north, the Canada jay.
Commonly known in the northern forests
and Rockies as whisky jacks, moose
birds or camp robbers, these birds com—
monly remain the year round in their
usual haunts. This season, however, a
rare southern migration of Canada jays
has taken place. Seldom seen south of the
Ottawa River, specimens were spotted in
the fall months as far south as Toronto
and other points on the Great Lakes or
near the American border.

Just why some Canada jays move
southward at long intervals, and whether
or not the wanderers return to their
northern homes in the spring, no one
seems to know. From the observations of
many amateur bird lovers the Depart-
ment of Mines and Resources at Ottawa
hopes to ascertain this year something
of the extent of the migration and possi-
bly an inkling of its relation to other
occurrences in the world of nature.

The bold “Whisky jacks” are about
the size of robins, with a soft, ﬂuffy plu-
mage that is chieﬂy neutral gray. The
throat and breast are white, with vary-
ing amounts of dark feathers around
the eyes and head. The harsh cries and
clear, short whistle of the Canada jay
are familiar to all travelers in the north-
ern mountains and woodlands. Their
fearlessness makes them common visitors
at camp and often they raid the frying
pan or dish when the camper is not look—
ing, or learn to accept food from the
hand of those who take the trouble to
coax them a little. They breed as far
north as the forests go, and how they
keep the eggs warm in the nests, made
as early as March, is a mystery.

 

WHILE THE CANADA JAY GLARED, THE CAMERA CLICKED

J an. 191,2

Photographing the Canada Jay

MYRON M. TEEGARDEN
See accompanying picture

QNE afternoon in October, while pic-
nicking in the vicinity of the Rocky
Mountain National Park, we noticed a
number of large gray birds which we
call “camp robbers,” darting around
through the trees. These birds were ap-
parently very hungry, as they would con-
tinually swoop toward the table upon
which we had prepared our lunch.

Thinking that perhaps I could photo-
graph one of them by luring them
with food, I focused my camera on a
spot on a rock, placed a piece of bread
upon the spot, and sat down to wait
patiently for one of the “robbers” to
pounce upon the bait.

I waited for perhaps two hours before
any of them would come near enough to
grab the bread and then they would
leave so quickly that I could not click
the shutter. However, one more bold
than the rest, ﬁnally came and lit right
on the spot, and faced me with an ex-
pression as much as to say, “I dare you
to take it away.” While he glared, the
camera clicked. But, by this time a con-
siderable number of the birds had be-
come interested in the prospect of 0b-
taining food, and I was able to snap
another one as he picked up his morsel
of bread and left. Although I spent
about three hours’ time getting these
photographs, I enjoyed every minute of
it and later on will go back and try to
get some better ones.

Birds do not always give up to die
when a wing is broken. They are often
able to set their own bones by placing
their wings in a position for the bones
to knit while the bird sits quietly wait-
ing for the process to complete itself.
The mate feeds the wounded bird during
its trial.

The Birds9 Dietician
MARY AGNES COLVILLE

HE famous and revered English

nurse, Florence Nightingale, was, as
may be readily imagined, one of the busi-
est women in the world. Yet, in spite of
being heavily weighed down with many
pressing responsibilities, Miss Nightin—
gale managed to ﬁnd time always to en-
joy the society of birds.

For these small friends she painstak-
ingly prepared tasty nourishing meals,
and the feathered visitors used to gather
daily in large numbers gratefully at Miss
Nightingale’s window to be fed. She did
more than offer generous hospitality in
every season—under any and all circum-
stances. She made a special intensive
study of the dietary care necessary to
preserve the health and well-being of the
birds.

This was a research which Miss Night-
ingale never tired of, and which ranked
closely in importance to the dietary care
given by her to humans.

To the wonderment of her associates,
she could give much thought to the wel-
fare of vast hordes of birds without
slighting for even a moment her capable,
helpful supervision of her staff and her
hospital patients.

The birds loomed as very important in
her personal scheme of things. The grit,
cheeriness and sheer independence of
these tiny lively creatures had a distinct
appeal for one who was so brave and fear-
less herself.

Often when she received the gift of
some delicacy from a relative or an ad-
mirer, Miss Nightingale would use it

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

sparingly for her own enjoyment, in or-
der that later she might share some of it
with these out-of—door friends who de—
pended on her hospitality.

Florence Nightingale said that if she

were a teacher, she would teach children -

to regard birds as living beings entitled
to kind consideration at all times. It was
her ﬁrm belief that inculcating this view—
point in receptive young minds was far
more important than any mere routine
knowledge or ornithological classiﬁcation.

No Happenstance

M. H. MORGAN

VERPRODUCTION in the animal
world indicates potential loss, us-
ually in the early stages. Proportioned to
the enemies to be met, Nature seems in-
tent on preserving the breed at all costs,
that out of the many some at least may
survive.

The most proliﬁc creatures in the world
are the ﬁshes, a large codﬁsh being ca-
pable of depositing more than nine mil-
lion eggs in a season; a single mackerel,
half a million; and a perch, ﬁfty thousand.
Some ﬁshes are cannibalistic, and devour
their own eggs or small fry, but if they
don’t attend to it, there are plenty more
who will, for the oceans fairly reek with
enemies.

Birds that build their nests on the
ground produce more eggs to the clutch
than song or ﬂight birds whose natural
habitat is the air and high treetops.
While even lofty branches present some
hazards, they are not to be compared
with the perils of the earth. An effort
is made by the ground-dwellers to con-
ceal and camouﬂage such nests as much
as possible, but the young are still sub-
ject to many dangers. Where the clutch
falls short numerically, an equalization
occurs through producing more than one
brood in a summer.

The same is true of animals that live
in dens in the earth; their litters are
usually large for the species, and there
is more than one litter in a season.

Dame Nature is a wise old mother,
and while there seems to be a shocking
waste of life in some groups, she man-
ages to maintain a certain balance by
the various means at her command.

Cruelty to Animals”; that it is the second incorporated (March,
1868) Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the coun-
try, and that it has no connection with any other similar Society.

Any bequest especially intended for the beneﬁt of the Angell
Memorial Animal Hospital, should, nevertheless, be made to the Massa-
chusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals “for the use
of the Angell Memorial Animal Hospital,” as the Hospital is not incor-
porated but is the property of that Society and is conducted by it.

FORM OF BEQUEST

I give to The Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals (or to the American Humane Education Society), the sum
of .......... dollars, (or, if other property, describe the property).

Air-Raid Shelters for Animals

ROM time to time the Massachusetts

. S. P. C. A. has received inquiries
from interested humanitarians with ref—
erence to the erection of air-raid shelters
for animals. Many had noticed items in
British magazines telling of such shel-
ters being maintained by the Royal So—
ciety in London, and others felt that sim-
ilar shelters should be built in this
country.

We have just received a letter from
Mr. S. G. Polhill, acting chief secretary
of the Royal Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals in London, who
has this to report with reference to
animal air-raid shelters:

“We are not erecting air-raid shelters
for animals because the provision of
such shelters is a very expensive thing.
What we have done is to make arrange-
ments with the London County Council
that in various rest centers for human
beings, provisions should also be made
for dealing with animals.

“As no doubt you are aware, a rest
center is a place to which bombed, home—
less people are sent when their homes
are destroyed . . . The difﬁculty which
faced us was that frequently people’s
animals were taken to these rest centers,
but the ofﬁcials could not deal with them,
and to transport them to other centers
was a difficult matter because, apart
from the question of food, petrol is
short. We have therefore arranged
with the London County Council that
animals shall stay at another part of the
rest centers, which are usually schools
or other large buildings.

“Apart from this we have supplied
equipment (food, ﬁrst-aid outﬁts, etc.)
and it is being done, thanks to the help
received from the Massachusetts S. P.

OUR ,DUMB ANIMALS

C. A. . . . and other splendid helpers in
the United States.”

In conjunction with the National Ca-
nine Defence League, the Royal Society
erected one shelter in Kensington Gar—
dens at a cost of $720. This, however,
was a special case as many animals are
exercised in the Gardens and many hu-
man shelters are nearby.

Based upon the British experience
with the problem, it would not appear
to be advisable to erect animal air-raid
shelters in this country. The cost is
great, and the need not too clearly indi-
cated. Pet—owners must learn to appre—
ciate their responsibility toward pets,
and take such precautions as have been
previously outlined by the Society.

Taken for Granted

The public often seems to take our
Societies for granted. Many people, we
are afraid, believe we function like a
robot, with no particular need for ﬁnan-
cial or moral support. Whether the gen-
eral public believes our Societies are
state controlled and, as such, operated
out of public funds, or whether it be-
lieves we are sufﬁciently well endowed
as to require no additional support, we
don’t know. The very real service we
render apparently never strikes the
great mass of people at all.

The fact of the matter, however, is
that daily great sacriﬁces are made in
order that the work can go on, but with-
out the constant support and help of our
friends we could not carry on. Our
Societies have never accepted support
from the state, city or community fund,
as our faith in our sup-porters has never
failed thus far.

The years ahead will be difﬁcult, but
every method of economizing has been
put into effect in both Societies and in
our Hospital. We face the future with
courage and with a determined effort
to carry on. War, depressions and hard-
ships will not deter us from our goal.

College President Enrolled

In a letter received by one of our of-
ﬁcers from Dr. Stewart W. McClelland,
president of Lincoln University, Harro-
gate, Tennessee, is this paragraph:

“Believe it or not, when I was just
a small boy I was the president of our
Band of Mercy Society of Fredericks-
town, Ohio. Of course, I was raised on
‘Beautiful Joe.’ ”

A lady, checking over her grocery
bill, found this item: “One tom cat, 15

meant by such a charge. “Oh, that’s
all right, Mrs. Blank,” he replied.

“That’s just an abbreviation for tomato
catsup.”

A Splendid Victory

FTER twenty-ﬁve years of strenuous

effort by our Society to stop the sale
of day—old chicks at Easter time to people
who take them home for their children
to play with, thus subjecting the poor
creatures to more or less suffering—for
the majority of them die very soon—Dr.
George Lynde Gately, Health Commis-
sioner of Boston, has issued an order
banning the sale of day-old chicks and
ducklings in lots of less than a dozen.
This, of course, does not interfere with
the shipping and sale of day—old chicks
in large numbers to those who are pur—
chasing them to raise.

This is a splendid Victory for which
the Society is most happy. Dr. Gately’s
order might well be copied by every city
in America.

Heavy Fine for Cruel Act

“Mr. Wilson, you are the meanest man
ever to come into my courtroom. I am
sorry the maximum penalty for cruelty
to animals is only $100. You are ﬁned
that, and I am raising your ﬁne for
promiscuous shooting in the presence of
children from $200 to $300.”

With those words Judge David W.
Fitzgibbon, of the Court of Criminal
Correction, St. Louis, Missouri, recently
ﬁned Lloyd L. Wilson, a chauffeur, a
total of $400. Wilson had appealed his
case after having been found guilty in
the lower court.

Felix Turlin, Jr., aged twelve, and his
mother told the court that the dog,
“Spotty,” was a “very retiring kind of
dog.” Moreover, it was explained that
Felix and his fair companions were
within a ﬁfteen-foot radius of the dog
when Wilson shot it with a .22 caliber
riﬂe. Spotty, treated by a veterinarian,
recovered from its wound.

The above case is only one of three
which has recently been successfully
prosecuted by the Humane Society of
Missouri in St. Louis. Managing Direc-
tor Arnold M. Amundsen and his able
staff are constantly on the alert for vio-
lations and should be congratulatedvupon
the Society’s excellent accomplishment.

We have always maintained that the
staff of our two Societies is without a
rival, and on Sunday, March 28, we
found further proof of our pardonable
pride when a team consisting of four
staff members successfully defeated a
team representing the Animal Rescue
League of Providence, Rhode Island.

The contest was staged over the
Yankee Network on the radio program
known as “Quiz of Two Cities.” The
ﬁnal result upholding the honor of our
Societies and the City of Boston was 125
points for Boston to 52 points for Provi-
dence. Vera/i, m'di, vici.

“Happy-Go-Lucky Fish”
FRANK SLATER

OU may freeze it into a cake of ice;
ship it around the world, or keep it
frozen indeﬁnitely. Then thaw it out and
it will go right on eating where it left off.
It is probably the most happy-go—lucky
creature that lives, and if you have a gold—
ﬁsh pool you may have lots of entertain-
ment and pleasure in looking after these
fascinating ﬁsh.

You will see ﬂashing gold among the
top minnows which should be kept in any
ﬁsh pool to keep down mosquito larva.

The goldﬁsh is a member of a very
numerous family—the carp family——
which includes the minnow, barbel, gud—
geon, roach, chub, dace, tench, bitterling,
bream, bleak, and many others.

Developed in ancient China from a
much duller hue the goldﬁsh was intro-
duced into England in 1728 and into prac—
tically every other country since then. It
will live anywhere and doesn’t seem to
mind.

The most amazing things may happen
to it but it takes whatever comes in a
most perfect way. When it gets very
cold and the water freezes over the pool
it just snuggles down into the mud or
sand at the bottom, and waits until it
thaws out again. It is not even necessary
to break the ice to let in air.

In the goldﬁsh farms many beautiful
kinds have been developed. One of the
ﬁnest and most satisfactory kind, is the
“comet” so called because of its long,
wavy tail, and large, ﬂoating ﬁns.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Frightened

Marion Everett

Hayn

The bird stood on my window sill,
Frightened, as though he would instill
Within my mind that he well knew
He could not live on glistening dew;
He shook his feathers in the cold —

A timid creature of God’s told,

And waited in the dripping rain

Till I brought suet and some grain;
And pecking at the food, apart—
He left his imprint on my heart.

 

In England, they keep them in the pools
and reservoirs that supply water to the
big boilers of the mills, and to save the
water, it is pumped back hot into the
pond or reservoir, and the goldﬁsh not
only love it, but they grow enormously
big and fat, and the temperature of the
water is sometimes up to one hundred
degrees Fahrenheit.

In France, in the Palace Gardens where
Marie Antoinette used to feed the carp
one hundred and ﬁfty years ago, they are
still there, big, fat and happy. If fed and
protected from capture they may live for
another one hundred and ﬁfty years.

A good friend of our Society recently
suggested to us a new aid for the removal
of porcupine quills, and we are happy to
pass the information on to our readers.
Before attempting to pull out the quills,
gently rub in warm oil or grease which
will then permit the withdrawal of the
quills with much less pain or struggle.

A PRIZE WINNER

 

Unfairly Named

JACK KYTLE

F all birds burdened with an accus-
ing name, the cedar waxwing least
deserves that of “cherry bird.” Here is a
friend as valuable as any the horticultur-
ist, farmer, or fruit grower could have.
Yet for years, the unfair name, with its
implication of destructive raids upon
orchards, has persisted.

No one can deny that the waxwing
likes cherries, but for the most part, it
feeds upon the wild instead of cultivated
varieties. Through long study, conserva-
tion authorities know that at least 75

per cent of its food is obtained from the

forests, and that its relish for cedar, blue,
service, and buffalo berries is equally as
great as for cherries.

As a friend to ﬂowers, farm products,
and fruit trees, the little bird has few
equals. It feeds upon insects whenever
they can be obtained, and has an especial
fondness for caterpillars. At times, when
they are in abundance, it practically con—
ﬁnes itself to a diet of canker-worms.

The cedar waxwing is a sociable,
jaunty-appearing bird. It has no song,
only a low, wavering note, but its deli-
cately-blended beauty makes up for this
shortcoming. During most of the year,
it moves in a ﬂock of its fellows, winging
swiftly between patches of forest and
from ﬁeld to ﬁeld.

Please remember the American Hu-
mane Education Society in your will.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

One of Them

BOOK was written years ago en-

titled “Birds of God.” Surely one
of them is our lovely and helpful friend,
Bob-white. The story of his service to
the farmer is a ﬁne one and, besides that,
he is a beautiful bird, and his cheery
call, “bob-white,” is a welcome sound to
our ears.

Weed seeds form more than half the
total food of this lovely bird’s diet, and
they are the worst weeds against which
the farmer has to contend. Animal food,
too, chieﬂy insects, composes nearly one-
sixth of the bird’s subsistence, and from
June to August, when insects are most
numerous, their proportion in the food
is about 36 per cent. These insects, too,
are among the most destructive agricul-
tural pests, such as the Colorado potato
beetle, the 12-spotted cucumber beetle,
the bean leaf beetle and wireworms.

Alas that they are such easy prey to
the hunter. One wonders if they are to
be exteriminated as have some other
winged creatures that have been a bless—
ing to humanity.

The stories of bob-white, the bluebird,
the robin, the wren, the catbird, the song
sparrow, the Baltimore oriole, and other
birds useful to the farmer, are told in a
pamphlet issued by the United States
Department of the Interior, Washington,
D. C., and can be had for only ten cents.
It is worth sending for.

Protest Poisoning of Wild Life

For quite some time the U. S. Biologi-
cal Survey, now the Fish and Wildlife
Service, has been engaged in a campaign
of poisoning and trapping so—called pred-
atory animals. Farmers in many parts
of the country maintain that predatory
animals destroy some of their unguarded
cattle and sheep and, as a result, en-
courage the “Survey” poisoning and
trapping efforts, but informed biologists
explain that the campaign is doing seri—
ous injury.

The American Society of Mammalo-
gists recently stated that the campaign
was harmful “because it upsets the bal-
ance of nature.” Commissioner of In-
dian Affairs, John Collier, said,
“Throughout this country, this and that
and another campaign of slaughter of
wildlife is carried forward at a heavy
cost to the United States government . . .
Indeed, sooner or later, these campaigns
would appear to be directed at nearly the
whole of the mammalian kingdom still
existing on the ranges and in the wilds.”

Many a citizen who has gladly paid
his income tax and bought defense bonds
to the best of his ability will look in
amazement when he ﬁnds out that the
Government in its new budget still ap-
propriates $765,000 for predatory animal

M ay, 1942

control. This amount of money could
well be expended on the national defense
effort, and protest should be sent imme—
diately to the Honorable Harry F. Byrd,
U. S. Senate, Washington, D. C. Sena—
tor Byrd is chairman of a joint com-
mittee of Congress on non-defense ex-
penditures.

Fondouk in Need of Funds

During the past few difficult years
the American Fondouk Maintenance
Committee has carried on valiantly try-
ing to raise sufﬁcient funds to continue
the splendid work in Fez, Morocco.

Much concern has been expressed since
the 1941 ﬁnancial statement was made
available, as it showed a continued de—
cline in contributions. The war, taxes
and decreasing income have been respon-
sible for this.

We hope all the friends of the Fondouk
will continue to support the work, and
also that new contributors will be found.
The work in Morocco, under the super-
vision of Mr. G. Delon, deserves utmost
consideration.

Again from Syria

Working against tremendous odds and
with very little help from public opinion,
our representative, Mr. N. B. Matta in
Syria, writes from Lebanon that they
have been able to care for fourteen un-
fortunate and suffering donkeys, nine
horses, ﬁve dogs, two rabbits and one
mule; that they have restored to their
owners, six cows, four donkeys and three
small dogs.

He also reports that a friend of his,
living in a neighboring district, has sent
in a report saying that his work in
preaching humaneness in villages among
farmers has been well received and that
he has been able to form Bands of Mercy
in certain schools—that another friend
has organized six Bands of Mercy in
Syria and ten in Lebanon and had
preached on cruelty to man and animals,
as opportunity offered.

Jefferson and His Horses

Henry S. Randall in his biography of
Thomas Jefferson, devotes considerable
space to the great statesman’s love of
ﬁne horses. He tells us that in his
younger days J efferson was most ﬁnical
in his treatment of his mounts. When
his saddle horse was led out, if there
was a spot on him that did not shine as
faultlessly as a mirror, he rubbed it
with a clean pocket handkerchief. If it
became soiled the groom was severely
reprimanded. Jefferson’s decided pref-
erence was for the Virginia race horse;
he did not ride and was scarcely willing
to drive any other. He usually kept
half a dozen brood mares of high quality.

Of J efferson’s horses the ﬂeet, ﬁery,

but gentle—tempered “Eagle” was the
favorite.

The Horse as Friend of Man
GEORGINA DAVIS

URING one of my somewhat re-

stricted visits last summer to one
of our English seaside health resorts I
came across a peculiar instance of the
inner workings of the mind of a horse
which h-as puzzled not only myself, but
several of my friends who take more
than a passing interest in our dumb
friends. Owing to the present situation
the usual assortment of donkeys and
ponies carrying their loads of happy
children for a short ride along the sands
on the front are no longer there, but have
been allowed to ply for hire near the
promenades above the sands. I was in-
terested in a pretty little foal about nine
months old, and business being rather
quiet at the time, the owner of the stand
told me a strange story about the foal
which had been named “Dick.”

He was, of course, only an ornament
and was allowed to run loose in the vi-
cinity and had not been broken in. His
search for occasional tid-bits led him to
Visit some of the Villas on the front, and
Dick always remembered where a dear old
lady lived who was especially kind to him.

One day he was seen to trot off on his
usual round, but this time, to the surprise
of his owner, he took his place at the head
of a funeral procession which was then
traveling towards the cemetery, about
two miles out of the town. Dick kept
pace with the vehicles, and on reaching
the cemetery gates stood until the last
mourner had entered then trotted back
home, but he had paid his last tribute to
the dear old soul who had been kind to
him.

(For this last paragraph we cannot
vouch—Editor.)

 

HILLSIDE

 

Roans Considered the Best

GEORGE E. DAVIS

T is still believed by horsey men that
the best all round horse is the roan,
but many experts believe that there is a
close relationship between color and
temperament, ﬁnd a good horse and he
will not be a bad color. I spent some
time in my younger days as assistant
groom in a large establishment, and it
was common advice given at that time
to prospective buyers—
One white foot, buy him;
Two, try him;
Three, look about him;
Four white feet, do without him.

Among English buyers and owners,
black stockings are popular when con—
nected with a gray or chestnut, and spe-
cial favorites are the bays with black legs
and one white stocking. One white foot
or a white star on the forehead de-
notes kinship with a thoroughbred.
Roans, either strawberry or blue, are
looked upon as the hardest workers, in
addition to being even tempered, and eas-
ily broken in to any harness. It is an old
belief among the farming classes that
horses are good weather prophets, in so
far that at the close of the day in hilly
districts, if a horse is noticed standing
alone on a hilltop, ﬁne weather can be
expected.

Docking Disproved in Early
Fiction
In “Sir Charles Grandison,” published
as early as 1753, Samuel Richardson puts

into a letter purported to be written by
Harriet Byron, these words about Sir

Charles. “What I think seems a
little to savour of singular-
ity, his horses are not
docked; their tails are only
tied up when they are on
the road. This I took notice
of when we came to town.
But if he be of the opinion
that the tails of these noble
animals are not only a nat-
ural ornament, but are of
real use to defend them
from the vexatious insects
that in summer are so apt
to annoy them (as Jenny
just now told me was
thought to be his reason for
not depriving his cattle of a
defence which nature gave
them), how far from a dis—
praise is this humane con—
sideration! And how, in the
more minute as well as, we
may suppose, in the greater
instances, does he deserve
the character of the man of
mercy, who will be mercifu’
to his beast!”

Honored for Humanity

We have always been proud of our
splendid Navy and its excellent ofﬁcers,
but Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman,
commander of the ill-fated U.S.S. Lex—
ington, brought additional honor to the
ﬂeet when he showed his humaneness in
not leaving his ship without taking
along his pet dog, “Admiral Wags.”

The humane movement in America
promptly honored the gallant Admiral,
and on June 27 Sydney H. Coleman,
President of the American Humane As—
sociation (a federation of animal wel-
fare societies in the United States), pre-
sented a medal to Admiral Sherman in
recognition of the rescue of his dog.

We are quite certain that one of these
days “Admiral Wags” will ﬁnd a way to
repay the debt. The loyal companionship
of a good dog and a good master is a
delightful thing to behold—especially in
this day and age.

An Unusual Gift

The 179th Infantry, stationed at Fort
Devens, Massachusetts, has not only been
doing its part for national defense
through its 100% buying of bonds, but
its remarkable little dog, known as
“Blackout,” has scratched out his niche
in the canine hall of fame by becoming
responsible for a twenty-ﬁve dollar war
bond which has been made over to the
Massachusetts Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, through its
branch in Fitchburg, Massachusetts.

We can only express to “Blackout”
our appreciation of his rare thoughtful—
ness through Technical Sergeant Her—
bert L. Bailey, Technical Adviser for the
Company.

Something New at the Farm

HE following, from the Tribune, Law-
rence, Massachusetts, tells of an un-
usual way of dealing with the young,
winning their help and co-operation in-
stead of antagonizing them and encourag—
ing disregard of order and discipline:
There’s a lesson to be learned from a
clever idea put into operation by William
W. Haswell, superintendent of the
Rest Farm for Horses of, the Massa—
chusetts Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, 400 Broadway,
Methuen. For some time past, the So—
ciety’s extensive holdings in the suburban
town have been subjected to intermittent
sieges of vandalism. Mr. Haswell con—
ceived the idea of forming a sort of
military troop of young boys, with ofﬁ-
cers and everything, to help guard the
property and discourage other young lads
who showed an inclination to be mis-
chievous. Now the outﬁt is about thirty
strong and is doing excellent work. In
exchange for their services, the young-
sters have the run of the beautiful
M. S. P. C. A. grounds and the feeling
that they are making'tangible contribu—
tion to worthy enterprise. Adult mem-
bers of Mr. Haswell’s staff hold the rank
of sergeant in the troop, and if the boys
encounter any situation they can’t handle
themselves, the men take over. Boys
“captured” on the grounds are “court-
martialed” but the sentences meted out
are not very stiff. Invariably, the “pris-
oners” win amnesty for themselves by
agreeing to become members of the troop.

In the treatment we accord to our
faithful animal friends we reveal our own
character. One generation dedicated to
kind and thoughtful treatment of others,
to humanitarian principles, would cause
much of the sorrow and suffering in the
world to disappear.

The Negro and the War

N recent months much has been
printed about the place of the Negro

in the war effort, and it was with real
pleasure that we noted a splendid, tenl
page layout, excellently illustrated, in "a
recent issue of Life Magazine, which
graphically told the following story:

“Negro soldiers have fought well un-
der all the great Generals in all the great
wars and in most of the famous battles
of United States history. And they have
fought well. A Negro, Crispus Attucks,
was the ﬁrst American to fall under
British ﬁre in the Boston Massacre of
1770. Negroes fought beside the Min-
ute Men at Bunker Hill and the Conti—
nentals at Red Bank, New Jersey, where
George Washington himself singled them
out for praise.

“When Andrew Jackson stopped the
British invaders at New Orleans in 1815,
a battalion of ‘free men of color’ formed
part of his front line. In the Civil War,
161 regiments of Negro troops turned
the tide for the North. ‘Without their
help,’ said President Lincoln, ‘neither the
present nor any coming administration
can save the Union.’

“Negro cavalry men chased Indians in
the West and rescued Rough Riders at
San Juan Hill. In World War I, more
than 200,000 Negro troops went to
France.”

In the present war the Negro has al-
ready distinguished himself. At Pearl
Harbor a Negro messman, Dorie Miller,
heroically rescued his superior ofﬁcer
and was awarded the Navy Cross. In the
Philippines, Negro Private Robert Brooks
was the ﬁrst man of the armed forces to
fall in action. The main parade ground
at Fort Knox has been named “Brooks
Field” in his honor. The Negroes have
much reason for being proud of their ex-
cellent record. .

If you have not yet received any leaﬂet
telling of what to do with animals in
case of an air raid, send a postcard to
our Society and we shall be glad to sup-
ply a limited number for personal use.

From what is reported as a little dog’s
broadcast from a New York studio, the
following is taken:

“If there is a pussy in your house, do
not be anxious about her, she can take
care of herself, [being small and so lithe
that she can wriggle into any little va-
cant place and she seems to have an un-
canny knowledge of such safe corners
if a building is demolished.”

During 1941 almost 40,000 human
lives were snuffed out as a result of
automobile accidents. This record is a
blot spreading over the entire United
States. Let us hope during 1942 that
automobile drivers will be more careful
and considerate of human lives—needed
so much for our country’s all-out effort in
this desperate emergency. Forty thousand
soldiers in the Philippines, where Gen-
eral MacArthur could use them, would
make all the difference in the world.

The British people have always been
great admirers of animals and ready to
honor those who work in their behalf.
Even in wartime this principle has not
been forgotten. On February 3 the crew
of the sunken aircraft carrier “Ark
Royal” was honored with a silver medal,
presented by Our Dumb Friends’ League.

When this vessel was torpedoed, these
brave men did not forget the ship’s cats,
but saved all of them. The medal was
accepted by the First Lord of the Ad-
miralty for presentation to the next
British warship bearing the name of
“Ark Royal.”

“The Greatest Thing in the
World” V

DO you remember that extraordinary

lecture delivered years ago by
Henry Drummond with the above title?
It went far and wide in many tongues.
It gathered up into itself the heart and
substance of all religion worth the name.
It told of something greater than faith,
for even that, in spite of all the wonders
it hasaccomplished, so far as character
is concerned, without it amounts to noth-
ing.".f'Even the gift of such speech as
angels might use isn’t worth the time it
takes to utter it—that is, without this one
other thing—and that one greatest thing
of all, that one thing whose everlasting
symbol is a Cross—is Love. No, this
isn’t a sermon.

Are we in danger today of blotting out
that glorious word and putting that un-
holy thing, Hate, in its place? Are we
saying, “I hate the Germans, I hate the
Italians, I hate the Japanese?”

War, greed, lust for power, cruelty in
all its ugly shapes I must hate, but even
my enemy, though guilty of these crimes,
is a human brother. Probably born and
trained as he has been, I should be just
like him. Affection for him because of
his evil deeds I cannot feel, I need not
feel, but I can at least treat him as I
would like to have him treat me if I were
in his place, and to do by him as I would
like to have him do by me is to fulﬁll the
law—even the law of Love. That poison—
ous thing called Hate, alive within the
heart, works its deadliest harm, not to
the hated but to the hater.

Let no reader of the above think that
its purpose is for a moment to keep him
from doing his utmost to help his coun-
try triumph over the evils that confront
it today in this cruelest of all cruel wars,

or that it is the plea of an irrational
paciﬁsm. It is simply the re-statement
of that eternal and realistic Truth for
which Calvary forever stands.

Two Words

RUELTY” and “brutality” are words

we often use in describing many of
the'vicious practices we come in contact
with in humane work. They are not
pleasant words; in fact they are ugly
little nouns with which all of us are only
too familiar.

We can read hardly a single page of
history without shuddering at man’s in-
humanity to living creatures. Cruelty
and brutality have caused the downfall
of powerful nations, have driven men
and animals to kill in self-defense.

The element of cruelty is present in
our daily lives. We see it on the street,
reﬂected in the hungry man, woman or
child; in the columns of our daily papers;
in the movies; on the stage; in business,
politics and government.

We see the element of cruelty in the
child who shoots birds with an air-riﬂe
“for the fun of it,” and in adults who are
willing to pay good money to see bull~
ﬁghts and rodeos.

The person who is cruel to his fellow
human beings is apt to be more cruel to
animals. Kindness, the great virtue, be-
gets kindness, as we constantly see
through our efforts along lines of hu—
mane education. The millions of mem—
bers enrolled in our Bands of Mercy rep—
resent an ever—growing army of new
citizens inspired by the principles of
mercy, kindness and justice.

Though we use the word “brutality,”
we always feel like apologizing to what
we speak of as the brute creation because
it is only the human animal who can be
conscious of a cruel deed.

Consider the Horse I

T. J. MCINERNEY

S the war progresses, and tire and

gasoline restrictions become more
stringent, the horse will be called upon
more and more for help in meeting the
daily needs of the public for the delivery
of food and other articles. In some Sec-
tions of the country horses have already
replaced motor vehicles in the delivery
of such articles and it is a foregone con—
clusion that soon they will be pressed
into greater service elsewhere.

It is regrettable, of course, that after
years of comparative ease and retire—
ment, many horses will have to return
to harness, ﬁguratively and literally
speaking. If horses could speak, how-
ever, we know they would unhesitatingly
declare their willingness again to don the
traces and do their share towards achiev—
ing the victory for which we are all
working. Their willingness to co—operate
would far outshine that of many of us!

Since it is inevitable that horses will
again be put to work, it behooves each
and every friend of Old Dobbin to see
to it that he is not subjected to any
unnecessary hardship or cruelty while
being of service to man. Unfortunately,
as experience has shown, many owners
are concerned only with getting the ut-
most in service out of their horses. Not
a thought is given to their comfort and
well-being.

With the advent of warm weather, it
is essential that all animals have suf-
ﬁcient drinking water and particularly
horses, because of the strenuous work
they are compelled to do. Wherever pos-
sible, public watering troughs should be
established and maintained to supple—
ment those already available. Where
there are none, step-s should be taken to
provide them. Rotary, Lions, Kiwanis,
Junior Chamber of Commerce and simi-
lar groups in trough-less communities
might well undertake to raise the funds
necessary to ﬁll this important humane
need. If it is impossible to have water—
ing troughs, the individual home owner
can help ﬁll this void by keeping several
pails of fresh water within easy reach
of passing horses.

There are a number of thoughtless
and cruel acts to which horses are fre—
quently subjected and steps should be
taken at once to guard against them.
Among these are forcing a horse to walk
on a hot pavement or road without being
properly and comfortably shod; making
a horse work long hours at a stretch
without rest; improper and inadequate
feeding, and last, but by no means least,
unnecessary cruelty in an effort to get
more work or more speed out of the
animal. Humane societies and the proper
civil authorities can always be appealed
to in cases where cruelty persists.

“Myrtle,” U. S. Army Mule, Pride of the 25th

CHARLES MODESETTE

 

YRTLE,” a 34—year-old U. S.
M Army mule, might have been a

corpse today with a bullet through
her brain, but for a kind-hearted com-
manding officer at Fort Huachuca, Ari-
zona, who saved her life.

Some time ago Myrtle became very
sick—so ill, in fact, that she could not
get to her feet and would eat nothing
offered her.

A veterinarian examined her, pro-
nounced her case hopeless and suggested
that she be shot then and there. But
Col. Lee D. Davis, former commander of
the 25th U. S. Infantry and then serving
as post commander, refused to give the
order to shoot Myrtle.

“While there’s life, there’s hope,” he
reasoned. “Give her the best of atten-
tion and keep me informed as to her
condition.”

After several days Myrtle began to
show signs of improvement, and with
expert attention, she rallied, got to her
feet and recovered. Today she is well and
hearty, and still revered by officers and
enlisted men.

Myrtle’s colorful‘career with the army
included service a quarter of a century
ago when she was taken into Mexico when
General John J. Pershing commanded an
expedition to hunt down the Mexican
rebel and bandit leader, Pancho Villa.

Villa’s men raided the town of Colum—
bus, New Mexico, situated in an isolated
desert spot near the Mexican border. The
army came back without Villa but Myrtle
gained some new experiences.

The names of Parral, Colonia Dublan

and Carrizal, which appear on her parade
robes, are all names of cities or towns in
Mexico. The “M” stands for Company
M, a machine gun company with the 25th
U. S. Infantry with which Myrtle saw
so much service. It’s a Negro outﬁt,
commanded by white ofﬁcers. “Onward”
the motto of the 25th, appears on its
service flag.

A veteran of the World War, Myrtle
has been officially retired from active
service. Her only appearances in public
are on those occasions when, attired in
her robe of honor, she marches in drills
and parades.

Different kinds of animals, living in
the sea and the streams, on land and
underground, number into the millions.
And they weigh from four tons each
down to a size so small that they cannot
be seen by the naked eye. One of the
largest right now is the hippopotamus
which has a stomach ten feet long, a hide
an inch thick.

The world’s best tiller of the soil is
the earthworm. It has been estimated
that an acre of ground harbors 50,000
of them which, in a year, carry in their
bodies eighteen tons of dirt. That is,
they bring up from deep down in the
subsoil earth which, in successive stages,
they deposit on top of the ground. Thus
they literally plough their way up, loos—
ening the soil and providing for the per-
colation of water to myriad root systems
far below.

Morning Meeting

Harry Elmore Hurd

Alone, and running through the rain,

A hound-dog’s dissonant refrain

Split the dawn-dark where the slough
Rims the swamp, its Ow—w! Ow-w! Ow—w!
Resounding like a yelp of pain

Through the woods—a voice profane

And ominous, drawing nearer . . . near . . .
Until, listening, I could hear

The hound’s quick breath and rapid patter
Of staccato foottalls through the spatter
Of the rain—and then he stood

Upon a wall .' . . against the wood . . .
With one forepaw upraised in air

As though it had been frozen there

By the windblast of surprise.

There was wonder in his eyes:

Wonder quickening to tear

At seeing me, a stranger, near.

Thus he stood until I spoke,

Softly, to him—then he broke

The spell which held him. Wheeling to
The brush, he rent the air anew

With doletul sound: a sound as old

As hunger: tall as stories told

By hunters when the earth was young
And wine of memory loosed the tongue.

A Word from the North

It is our custom to send Oar Dumb
Animals regularly to all periodicals in
the United States and Canada that show
an interest in receiving it. From time
to time we receive complimentary notices
either in the papers or in letters from
the editors. Seldom, however, do we get
such an enthusiastic endorsement as the
following, from W. J. Raymond, presi-
dent of The Evening Empire, Prince Ru—
pert, B. C.:

The Publishers, Oni' Dumb Animals
Boston, Mass, U. S. A.

Gentlemen:

I should like to offer my sincere
thanks for your kindness in sending to
this ofﬁce a magazine that I never fail
to enjoy. We receive bushels of reading
matter but your periodical comes as a
wholesome and refreshing contrast. I
pass it along, and it may interest you
to know that many others, away up in
this North Paciﬁc port, share my opin—
ion.

Yours truly,

(Signed) W. J. RAYMOND

Authorities in the installation of
water systems for farms and homes give
the following daily requirements for
livestock: each horse, 10 gallons; each
cow, 25 gallons; Aeach hog, 2 gallons;
each sheep, 11/2 gallons; and for each
100 chickens; 4 gallons. See that ani-
mals in your care receive at least these
standard quantities of good fresh water
daily.

Huskies of the Arctic

JAMES MONTAGNES

HEN lives depend
Won dogs, dogs are

going to receive
good care. That is the way
the trappers, mounted po—
lice, Indians, Eskimos, pros—
pectors, fur traders and
missionaries in Canada’s
northland feel about their
dogs.

Everywhere north of
Canada’s railway line dog
breeders, amateur and pro-
fessional, are at work try-
ing to develop a strain of
sled dog superior to the
pure-bred Eskimo husky
which is now fast dis—
appearing. The dogs which
ply the trap trails in the
wooded regions and the
dogs which pull the sleds
over Arctic iceﬁ-elds for
missionaries and police are

 

SLED DOG SUCH AS USED IN THE
WESTERN CANADIAN ARCTIC

 

a mixed lot, in every color
from grayish-white of the pure-bred
husky, through blacks and browns, yel—
lows and spotted varieties, telling the
story of mixture with Russian wolf-
hounds, with wolves, big Newfound-
landers, mongrels, collies, even German
police dogs. Each breeder has something
else in View, to add speed, strength, size
or bush ranging qualities to his sled
dogs.

At the most northern police, mission
and fur posts, hundreds of miles above
the Arctic Circle, where planes do not
yet reach and boats come only once a
year, the purest bred Eskimo dogs are
found and receive the best care, for here
they are the main means of transporta—
tion. Here the dogs are fed seal and
walrus meat in winter. In summer they
are left to shift for themselves. They
ﬁnd mussels, crabs, ﬁsh, shrimp and
other seafood cast up on shore.

Because dogs are in such demand in
the northland, their price is often as
high as $250. Prices go up after each
dog epidemic, which spreads right across
the northland. Science has not yet found
an answer to this periodic disease which
strikes at the most isolated posts, hits
hard the transportation of Canada’s far
north, where the dog is still all—
important.

Faithful Even unto Death

“Three times this dog has saved his
little master from death. Once from
ﬁre, once from water, once from rob-
bers.” So reads the inscription in Latin
on a collar around the neck of a faithful
dog. But when danger threatened a
fourth time the devoted dog could not
save his young master.

You can see them today in the ancient
city of Pompeii, where they lived to-
gether and died together in the rain of
ashes and lava which buried the city
2000 years ago. Uncovered from the
ruins, they lie side by side, the boy’s
arm around the neck of the faithful dog,
which still wears the collar with its testi-
mony of his ﬁdelity to his master—~a
voice from the ancient past telling us
that the love of a boy for his dog and
the devotion of a dog to his master is
the same in all ages and in all lands.

With sad, calm eyes she scans the dis-
tant horizon of a sick and troubled
world, as resolutely forward over masses
of tortured and distressed humanity she
drives her mighty steeds of Truth and
Light.

Every heart must bleed from the hurt
of those righteous hoofs; every head
must bow in humble recognition of their
advancing might, ere the ﬂower of Uni—
versal Brotherhood comes to full bloom
in human consciousness, and men of” all
races and creeds learn to live together
in unity and peace. Then the mantle of
Justice shall enfold all creatures of
earth — human and sub-human. Then
the mission of life shall have been ful-
ﬁlled. . . .

Dare we hope for this?
the will to strive for this?

mals during Air Raids, recently issued
by the Planning and Technical Division of
the Massachusetts Committee on Public
Safety under authority of the Governor of
Massachusetts.

Chester L. Churchill, director of the Plan-
ning Division, and Dr. Francis H. Rowley,
president of the Massachusetts Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
headed the committee which drew up the
instructions to aid animal owners in the
state.

The ofﬁcial instructions follow:

8. Treat burns promptly. Cover with
'tannic acid jelly or strong cold tea.

9. Do not probe for deeply-imb-edded for-
eign bodies.

PRESIDENT ROWLEY READING THE OFFICIAL RULES AND REGULA—
TIONS FOR ANIMAL CARE DURING AIR RAIDS TO JOHN
J. CONROY, 10, OF ROXBURY, MASS, AND “SKIPPER”

7. Away from cities, during raids, horses
and cattle should be kept in open ﬁelds,
weather permitting. For winter, if pos-
sible, an open corral with shed accommo-
dations should be provided for the use of
animals accustomed to being continually
housed.

CHAPTER III.
Dogs

NOTE: Dogs will not be permitted in
public air-raid shelters:

1. License or identiﬁcation tags should be
worn at allxtimes—license tags are best.

2. Keep all dogs under strict control—
this means yard dogs chained; and house
dogs conﬁned to one room. Do not under
any circumstances turn dogs loose.

3. Exercise your dog near home.

4. Take dogs with you to private shelters
——in basement or wherever shelter is lo-
cated.

5. Keep dogs restrained by a leash. This
will protect your dog.

6. Keep drinking water available.

 

given on empty stomach. Nembutal may
be obtained through a prescription from
your veterinarian.

CHAPTER IV.
Cats

NOTE: Cats will not be permitted in
public air-raid shelters:

1. Use collars or harnesses with identi-
ﬁcation plates, not only during air raids,
but during the war emergency.

2. Conﬁne cats to one room and do not
permit to wander. They are timid and
grow panicky when any unusual noise
occurs.

3. If cat climbs out of reach, seek safety,
and after “all clear” signal, contact local
animal welfare organization.

4. Treatment in mild cases of FEAR, a
11/2 grain tablet of amytal given by mouth
to an eight-pound cat will induce sleep and
quiet.

5. Take cats with you to private shelters
—in basement or wherever shelter is lo-
cated.

Bands of Mercy or Junior Humane Leagues

Dr. FRANCIS H. ROWLEY, President

N July 28, 1882, in the
0 city of Boston, the ﬁrst

American Band of
Mercy was organized by Geo.
T. Angell, founder of the
Massachusetts Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Ani—
mals, and the Rev. Thomas
Timmins, of Portsmouth, Eng-
land.

On January 1, 1942, two
hundred and sixty-two thou-
sand, one ,hundred and thirty-
ﬁve Bands of Mercy, with
nearly eight million members,
had been organized.

In the month of December,
1941, one thousand, four hun-
dred. and forty-four new
Bands of Mercy, or Junior
Humane Leagues, were organ-
ized and reported by the ten
ﬁeld workers of the American
Humane Education Society
and others engaged in this
work. These were distributed
as follows:

Illinois ............... 695
Texas ................ 305
Virginia .............. 192
South Carolina ........ 98
Maine ................ 95
Florida ............... 41
Georgia .............. 11
Massachusetts ........ 5
New York ............ 1
Tennessee ............ 1

Food for Winter Birds

ALVIN M. PETERSON

HAT do the birds ﬁnd to eat when

it is bitterly cold and the ground
covered with Snow in winter? The
answer, so far as I have been able to
discover, is that they usually have little
trouble ﬁnding food in abundance, seeds,
waste grain, wild berries and insects
mainly. Birds have keen eyes and wits
and are able to ﬁnd food where we see
nothing that might be of use to them.

In the ﬁrst place, a valuable source
of food is the tall weeds one sees almost
everywhere. Hereabouts, there are sev—
eral weeds that seem especially desirable.
The ﬁrst is the lamb’s-quarters, a tall
succulent weed that sometimes is used
for greens. It produces great quanti-
t1es of tiny seeds. All winter long spar-
rows and other small birds visit these
weeds and feed upon their minute seeds.
Another is the amaranth, of which there
is more than one species, the redroot or

pig—weed and tumble weed, for example.
Still another is a species of wild mint, of
which there are a dozen species. And
still another is the mullein, though I
have come to the conclusion that the
birds as often glean insect foods from
this tall plant as seeds. The seeds of two
cultivated plants also are popular, those
of the asparagus and sunﬂower.

Wild berries are another important
source of food. Here, too, I have found
that a few species are particularly popu—
lar in winter. First of these is the wild
grape, of which there are several species.
Wild grapes are more or less shriveled in
winter, but cardinals, bob-whites and
other birds like them nevertheless. The
ﬁve-leaved ivy is another, and this vine,
too, is especially popular with the car-
dinal. Mountain ash berries I ﬁnd are in
high favor with the cedar waxwing‘s.
Then there is the hackberry, which is
relished by the robin, waxwing and
others. In fact, the hackberry is the chief
winter food of the robin and perhaps
other birds where it is abundant.

grades and in Sunday-schools-
of all denominations, Protes-

are principally in elementary
schools, but may consist of any
group of thirty or more, re-
gardless of age, who are will-
ing to take this simple

PLEDGE

I will try to be kind to all
living creatures and try to
protect them from cruel usage.

To such groups, when prop-
erly reported, the American
Humane Education Society of
Boston will send a supply of
free literature and a gilt badge
for the president. See inside
front cover for prices of lit-
erature and other Band of
Mercy supplies.

We believe such junior hu-
mane societies are absolutely
demanded in this country to
meet the unparalleled growth
of crime and lawlessness. Bands
of Mercy are implanting and
fostering in the minds of the
young the great principles of
justice, fair play, and kindness
towards every form of life,
human and sub—human. They
are quickening and inculcating
that spirit of chivalry and hu-
manity which characterizes the
best citizenship of the world,
whose influence and leading
will ﬁnally put an end to wars.

Waste grain is another source of
food. Haul a load of hay, take a few
forkfuls of straw from a stack, or move
a shock of corn and the birds will notice
what you have done, ﬂock to the place
and glean some food.

Almost every move a person makes
gives some bird a chance to glean a bite
to eat. Shovel a path and expose the
ground, and a bird is likely to visit the
spot and ﬁnd a few seeds. Move a box,
barrel or shed and expose the bare
ground and you have provided some bird
with a possible source of food. Throw
sweepings, garbage or a bone outside,
or cut a tree or chop some wood, and
you have given others a helping hand.

Trees, posts, stubs, stumps and even
buildings are other sources of food, since
birds glean insects, their larvae, pupae
and eggs from them. Nor must one over—
look the seeds and nuts of trees, all of
which are eaten by winter birds. Even
the lowly acorn is relished by the bob—
white, red-bellied and red-headed wood-
pecker‘s, blue jay and other birds.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

A Correction

Correspondence with the Dublin So-
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals asks us to contradict the state—
ment made in the June issue of Our Dumb
Animals that Michael O’Connor, whom
our Society has done a little something to
aid in his humane work in Ireland, had
been approved by them. They claim that

the statement we made in our paper about ,

their approval of him has no authority
in fact.

We regret to say this, because from in-
formation we had received from people
in Ireland, we understood that we were
stating the facts just as they were.

Humane Work in Salem,

Mass.

A highly creditable record of accom-
plishment in its work for animals during
the past year was made by the Animal
Rescue League of Salem, Mass. Its re-
port by the president, Miss Anna Fessen-
den, states that there were humanely and
mercifully killed 1,384 cats and kittens,
232 dogs and puppies, 21 birds, one goat
and one rabbit, and 24 lost dogs were re-
stored to their owners. Of this number
1,037 were stray animals or unpaid for.

A worthy effort was made in supplying
and caring for numerous drinking pans
for small animals by many of the active
members. Certain cases of cruelty were
referred to Agent F. T. Vickers of the
Massachusetts S.P.C.A. In her acknowl-
edgment of support and co-operation Miss
Fessenden says:

“To all and to everyone who, known
and unknown, have helped the league in
any way, the president wishes 'to extend
her personal gratitude and appreciation.”

Reports come to us from time to time
of small pet animals, particularly cats,
that have wandered into somebody’s cel-
lar or into the garage when the doors
were open through the day, and then the
doors closed sometimes for a day, maybe
over a week end, and the unfortunate
animal unable to get out and go home.
Care should certainly be taken to prevent
this ever happening.

 

Sept. 1942

Anent Vest’s Eulogy

' 0 more eloquent and touching tribute
was ever paid to man’s faithful
friend, the dog, than that of SenatorVest,
uttered some sixty-odd years ago. It has
long since become a masterpiece of hu—
mane literature and still is held to be as
perfect a piece of oratory as ever was
heard from pulpit or bar. In printed
form it has been given the widest circu-
lation through the years.

Rev. F. Rivers Barnwell, ﬁeld worker
in Fort Worth, Texas, of the American
Humane Education Society, Boston,
writes us concerning a recent interesting
incident as follows:

Mr. W. Clayborn Brown, a citizen of
Fort Worth, now 71 years old but alert
and active, was at one of my humane
exercises and heard my son recite the
famous “Eulogy on the Dog.” He came
to me and told me that he was in the
courtroom the day that Senator Vest de-
livered the famous Eulogy. Deﬁnite im-
pressions were made on him as on all of
those present. He was convinced from
that day that the dog is truly man’s best
friend and this impression has grown
with the years. He is glad that he is able
to testify to this interest and is a real
friend not only of the dog but of all
animals.

Michigan to the Fore

HE State of Michigan ranks high in

its recognition of the importance and
value of humane education. This fact is
substantiated in the recent report of
Edna I. Ape], State Chairman of the
Parent-Teacher Association. It is a re—
port that well deserves far more publicity
than we are able to give it.

Some of the more salient features of
this year’s program, however, may well
be noted: “To all sections of the State
packets were sent containing: (1) the
Michigan law which requires the teach-
ing of Humane Education in all public
schools a portion of every week, (2) a
Plan of Work covering a broad ﬁeld of
endeavor for the guidance of Chairmen,
(3) leaﬂets of interest to parents in fos-
tering the ideals of Humane Education
in the homelife of the child, (4) leaﬂets
for teachers suggesting co-ordination of
Humane Education with Geography,
Composition (essay and letter writing),
Art (Humane poster contests), Civics,
and Dramatic classes.”

Chairman Apel stresses the splendid
co—operation of the Humane Education
groups throughout the State with the
P. T. A., on all humanitarian measures,
which accounts for the progress and suc-
cess attained. In these ﬁtting words she
concludes her report: “The seeds of kind-
ness once rooted in the hearts of children
will grow on through the years enriching
and inspiring their entire lives.”

THE OLD FARMER’SALMANAC, Yan-

Where else in all the wide world can be
found such a fund of information, packed
into 96 pages, as is gathered in “The Old
Farmer’s Almanac” for 1942? This is the
150th consecutive year of publication, and
many extra features are included besides
the usual weather, sun, moon, planet and
tide corrections, game laws, and automo-
bile l‘aws for all the states. One can hardly
think of a farmer without thinking of a
horse, and here, among a noteworthy col-
lection of poems, anecdotes and pleasan—
tries, is a verse on “Equine Immortality.”
Another selection is called “Penguin.” An
original poem by Robert Frost and eleven
quotations selected by him from his “Col-
lected Works” give a literary ﬂavor to the
Almanac.

SUNNY ISLE OF JERSEY, Alfred S.
Campbell.

Mr. Campbell certainly knows his Chan-
nel Islands, as those who have read his
“Golden Guernsey” and “Under the Cap-
stone” can well testify. The present volume
is published in the interests of the Channel
Islands Refugee Fund, all proﬁts being
generously contributed by the author to
these unfortunate people who have been
driven from their homes to the mainland.
The story is a fascinating and romantic
one, full of witchlore and fairy tales.

In the chapter, “Bewitched Cattle,” he
sets forth the theory that the Jersey and
Guernsey breeds originated from common
ancestors. In “Jersey Cattle in America”
he presents very interesting facts and tabu-
lations of the scale of points for both bulls
and cows, approved by the directors of the
American Jersey Cattle Club.

The literary minded will be charmed
with the chapter on Victor Hug-o, who ﬂed
from the island by night, and the accounts
of the brief stays of George Eliot and
George Meredith.

The concluding chapter deals with the
author’s personal— experiences as “Cham-
bermaid on a Cattle-boat” while returning
to America with a load of Jersey cattle. Of
Jersey he says: “I shall never forget its
beauty, its tradition, its cattle and above
all the hospitality of its people.”

Liberal Annuity Rates

Both of our Societies offer you semi-
annually during your lifetime a fixed income
on the sum given. Depending upon your age
at the time of the gift, the rate varies from
41/2% to 9% per annum, beginning at age 45.

ADVANTAGES

No coupons to clip, no papers to sign and
mail. You simply receive your checks at
stated intervals—that’s all there is to it.

Annuity agreements are frequently used to
provide for the future years of a loved one
whose present income is temporary or in-
sufficient.

It is no experiment,

There is no anxiety,

No fluctuations in rate of income,

No waste of your estate by a will
contest.

Persons of comparatively small means
may, by this arrangement, obtain a better
income for life than could be had with equal
safety by the usual methods of investment,
while avoiding the risks and waste of a will
contest and ultimately promoting the cause
of unfortunate animals.

The management of our invested funds is
a guarantee of the security of these Life
Annuities.

TO OUR FRIENDS

In making your will, kindly bear in mind that the corporate title of
our Society is “The Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals”; that it is the second incorporated (March, 1868)
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the country, and
that it has no connection with any other similar Society.

Any bequest especially intended for the beneﬁt of the Angell
Memorial Animal Hospital, should, nevertheless, be made to the Massa-
chusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals “for the use
of the Angel] Memorial Animal Hospital,” as the Hospital is not incor-
porated but is the property of that Society and is conducted by it.

FORM OF BEQUEST

I give to The Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals (or to the American Humane Education Society), the sum
of. . ........ dollars, (or, if other property, describe the property).

Their Champion
MARY AGNES COLVILLE

IN her autobiography, Kate Douglas

Wiggin has frequently revealed her-
self as the champion of beast and bird.

On one occasion in her childhood,
young Kate found two wounded bull-
frogs by the side of a pond. They had
been the hapless victims of a cruel ston-
ing by small boys. Kate and her sister
bound up the frogs’ broken legs and
bruised backs and painstakingly nursed
and coaxed them back to health. The
girls saw to it that the convalescent
frogs always had an abundance of the
nourishment they liked but were poWer-
less to get for themselves.

Kate also gave each frog in the pond
an appropriate name. She regarded them
as very interesting neighbors, and en-
joyed greatly what she called their
“singing-school.”

In later years, when sojourning in
Paris, she told friends that she would
as soon think of eating the family kit-
ten as to taste frogs’ legs.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

In childhood years, Kate
also had a pet lamb on which
she lavished much care and
affection. As well, she min-I
istered efﬁciently to injured
insects, and describe-d them
as being in her “hospital for
sick bugs.”

A well-loved companion of
young Kate’s was a little
yellow dog named “Mr. Pip”
after one of Di‘ckens’ char-
acters. A stray dog was also
warmly welcomed into the
family circle by Kate, and
was duly christened “Mr.
Pocket” after another of
Dickens’ characters.

Some years later, when
traveling in Europe, Mrs.
Wiggin‘described an inter—
esting humane incident in
which she herself played a
major part. She was dining
with some friends in an out-
of—door restaurant one af—
ternoon, when suddenly a
Violent storm came up. The
wind quickly reached gale-
like proportions and enor-
mous hailstones descended,

The author’s ﬁrst thought was for‘E‘W-r

the safety of the many beautiful birds
who frequented the place in great num-
bers to get tasty tid—bits from the res—
taurant patrons, Mrs. Wiggin had the
waiters bring her a number of the small
stunned feathered victims of the storm.
These she proceeded to warm and gradu-
ally resuscitate. But her afternoon was
spoiled by the fact that innumerable
others of the birds had been killed out-
right or were so badly cripple-d as to
be beyond aid.

It was natural that the beautiful
“Bir-ds’ Christmas Carol” should come
from the pen of one who had such a
ready sympathy for these tiny fellow

creatures who so blithely share our
world.

Scatter Ye Bread Crumbs
While Ye May

Salvatore Marsiglia

Scatter ye bread crumbs while ye may—
’Tis little enough to do!

What of the joy a bluebird’s song,

The chirrup of robins all day long,

Can offer up to you?

Scatter ye seeds for a feathered feast—
For Chickadee and swallow!

Then will come the ray of pleasure

That arises without measure,

And is sure to follow.

Symphony at Animal Hospital

BOVE is a picture of a most unique

episode at the Angel] Animal Hos-
pital of the Massachusetts S. P. C. A.
in Boston. “Brownie,” (pet cocker span—
iel of Henry Levenson of Strathmore
Road, Brighton, was struck by an auto-
mobile and brought to the Hospital for
treatment. Every day, during the dog’s
convalescence, Henry called at the Hos-
pital with his cornet and played several
pieces for the entertainment of his
music—loving dog who always raised his
own voice, just as he was accustomed to
do in rehearsals at home.

Henry has been taking trumpet les—
sons for the past year and plays in the
band at the Boston Latin school where
he is a ﬁrst-year pupil. His musicales
with Brownie at the Hospital were by
no means just duets for nearly every dog
in the ward joined to swell the volume
of sounds.

Welcome Feast for the Birds

A correspondent in Cornwall, Ontario,
writes to tell us that he was so much in-
terested in an article in regard to a bird
feeding table which appeared recently
in Our Dumb Animals that he was en-
couraged to put out food for the birds at
his home during a heavy snowstorm.
He used buns with plenty of raisins in
them. Sparrows and grosbeaks came
eagerly to the feast, and he and his small
grand-daughter derived much pleasure
from watching them.

Parrot Voices
ANN R. ARMISTEAD

RACKERS are not Polly’s favorite

food. There are other things she
would much rather have, for this gor-
geous bird never heard of a cracker until
brought into domestic life.

What goes on inside of Polly’s head
no one knows, but if she could recall
past memories, she doubtless would long
for the tropical fruits, nuts and seeds
from tall grasses. She was raised on
these. For dessert she may like to suck
the nectar of ﬂowers as do many vari—
eties of her people back in their native
country.

These gaudy birds come from the
islands of the East Indies, India, Aus-
tralia, Africa and South America.

There are over ﬁve hundred species,
usually possessing screaming harsh
voices. Many can be taught to imitate
various tones of the human. voice.

The gray parrots of Western Africa
are the most easily trained to exercise
conversational powers. They and the
green variety of South and Central
America are more frequently found as
pets.

There are other well—known varieties.
The macaw with a loud screeching voice,
cockatoo and its harsh cry. The parakeet,
small in size, has a bright green body
with a pink circle around its neck. Un-
like all the others, its voice is agreeable
and it may be trained to speak distinctly.
In their native environment, parakeets
go about in pairs.

The lovebird is an especially small
parrot found in Africa. The affection
shown one another accounts for their
name.

The only species found in the United
States, is the Carolina parakeet, a bird
about thirteen inches long. Its body
plumage is green and it is topped with
a yellow head.

Parrots breed in hollow trees. They
have been known to reach the age of
seventy and even ninety years.

All are characterized by the large
curved upper beak and by the position of
the toes, two pointing forward, two back-
ward. They are good climbers, using
their long tails to assist in keeping their
balance. They are clumsy at walking but
strong when on the wing.

Nature has a way of making comp-en-
sations, for the most beautifully colored
bird has the harshest voice, whereas the
parrot of dullest colors is usually the
sweetest songbird.

It is frightful to go into the parrot
house of a zoo. All who are not trading
gossip with neighbors are screaming in-
dignantly.

EMU CHICK

OLD WITH THEIR

 

BEAUTIFUL STRIPED COATS

bies in the entire bird kingdom are

the chicks of that remarkable
ﬂightless bird‘——the Australian emu. The
emu chicks provide one of the ﬁnest ex-
amples in the whole world of nature of
defenseless creatures being endowed
with beauty as a means of protection,
for the markings of the chicks form a
camouﬂage costume blending so well
with their natural surroundings that the
tiny creatures are invisible from any
distance.

Unlike most other birds, the emu
chicks are able to run about almost as
soon as they are hatched, and having no
weapons of defense very few of them
would survive but for their protective
dress. At birth they have beautiful and
vividly striped coats (as shown in the
accompanying photograph) which blend
so admirably with the long grass of the
forest country they inhabit that the
young bird-s are very difﬁcult to see,
especially when they stand motionless
with head erect—a pose they always
adopt whenever danger threatens.

As the birds grow the stripes gradu-
ally disappear, and when fully—grown
(from ﬁve to seven feet in height) they
are of a uniform grayish-brown, the
feathers being tipped black, the neck
feathers grayish, and the throat and
neck bare.

The emu is the world’s second largest
and heaviest bird, only the ostrich ex-
ceeding it in size, and it has several
unusual features. It has no tail, and al-
though equipped with wings the bird is
incapable of ﬂight; this deﬁciency, how-
ever, is compensated for by its exceeding
swiftness of foot (the bird has been
timed to travel at a speed of more than
sixty miles an hour), and by its being
an expert and strong swimmer. It has
long, strong feet with three toes in front
but no hind toe.

PROBABLY the most beautiful ba-

The bird’s feathers are also abnormal;
each feather appear-s to be double, the
after-shaft being as long as the main—
shaft. Another remarkable feature of the
bird is that it possesses an aperture
about two inches and a half in front of
the wind pipe, with which is connected
a dilatable pouch. By means of this
peculiarity the bird produces a curious
drumming note than can be heard from
a great distance.

The birds live chieﬂy on grasses, in-
sects, native seeds and fruits, and for
the purpose of digestion they swallow
stones, pieces of iron, and other hard
articles.

The emu is found in a wild state only
in Australia. It is a ﬁne sight to see a
large ﬂock of the birds quietly feeding
in open country, or racing away across
a plain. As they run they keep their
necks stretched almost straight out and
low down. When a ﬂock is on the run
the heavy thuds of their feet seem to
shake the ground in the vicinity, while
their feathers make a peculiar rustling
noise.

The owl has noiseless wings, hides in a
hollow tree during the day, and hunts for
food at night when he has the keenest of
vision.

The mountain beaver can climb trees,
if they are not too tall, lopping oﬂ"
branches as it goes, but leaving stubs
long enough to use as rungs of a ladder
on its return. Sometimes it tops the
tree itself.

Woodpeckers are the tree doctors of the
bird world. With their powerful sharp
bills they dig insects out of the bark and
also cut holes for their nests. At least
half of the spruce-bark beetles of the
northeastern United States are said to
be eaten by woodpeckers.

gie,” the mouse; and “Aloysius,” the alli-
gator; all accompanied by large illustra—
tions by Carroll Snell. And, if none of this
assortment proves to be your perfect pet,
then there is a ﬁnal chapter telling about
many other possible animal companions.
Much valuable information will .be found
about choosing and keeping. such pets.

PAGEANT IN THE SKY, Raymond S.
Deck.

Here is “a book of the modern sport of
bird-watching,” to quote the sub-title. It is
by a distinguished authority whose scien-
tiﬁc background includes curatorial and
expedition work in ornithology at the
Brooklyn Museum and the American Mu—
seum of Natural History. Yet here he deals
not with specimens in glass cages but, from
practical experience, with the migratory
birds in the Canadian northwoods, in metro—
politan parks, and in the jungles of Brazil.
He says: “Birds are important to every—
one. To establish this thesis in a thoroughly
friendly way is the ambition of this book.”

Mr. Deck, fortunately, is a skilled wild-
life photographer. No less than forty out-
standing photographs are reproduced in
these thrilling pages of bird life.

DOG TRAINING MADE EASY, Wm.
Cary Duncan.

Along with the ever—increasing popu—
larity of the dog, whose present number is
estimated by the almost incredible total of
twelve millions for the whole country
there comes the desire or request from a
great many actual or prospective owners
for information and advice in respect to
this great and growing canine population.

Such information is made available by
this reliable and attractive book whose
author is the dog editor of Outdoor Life,
well-known breeder, judge at many shows
and life-long dog trainer and sportsman.

Herein may be found in understandable
language the answers to the many questions
that are continuously asked. Here are a few
of the more important subjects that are
discussed in this work of twenty-ﬁve chap-
ters: “The Breed to Choose,” The “House—
breaking Bugaboo,” “Good Motor Manners,”
“Training for Obedience Tests.” From be-
ginning to end the book will be a valuable
guide in keeping the dog in health, and
training it in the way it should grow. It is
a veritable storehouse of well—ordered in-
formation.

Numerous pen sketches demonstrate
training methods most effectively.

ALPHABET OF THE SEA, Nelle Caesar.

While this story of seashells is announced
as “A Handbook for Children,” it contains
much information that will appeal to the
adult who does not know his shells. There
are more than 25 different forms of sea
life described, each accompanied by a full—
page illustration. The author, who has been
a teacher in the public schools, uses lan—
guage especially adapted to pupils in the
intermediate grades. A valuable handbook
to have along on a trip to the coast.

POOR RICHARD’S DOG YARNS, Poor
Richard, Editor.

This is a unique anthology of dog verse
and prose, illustrated by 36 full-page pic—
tures of dogs and children. One of the
photographs reproduced is from Our Dumb
Anumals, all the others from the Harold
M. Lambert Studios of Philadelphia. In
addition to such familiar prose as Senator
Vest’s “Eulogy on the Dog” and Walter
A. Dyer’s “Prayer for a Pup,” and well-
known poems by Arthur Guiterman, Anne
Campbell and others, there are selections of
both prose and verse from numerous lesser-
known writers.

“The book is designed,” says the editor,
“to drive the brutality out of man and
serve humanity by bringing the plant of
kindness to full fruition.” The pages are
10 5/8 X 8 inches with heavy paper illus~
trated cover, and the typography is excel—
lent. A splendid gift book for any dog
owner or lover.

Oh, cricket chirping in the night,
Where shrubbery is deep

Below the window of my room,
You lull me off to sleep!

“Forget! Forget!" you seem to sing,
And worries of the day, ,

Hushed by the calmness of your tones,
Slip peacefully away.

You are my kindly, unseen friend,
Although you do net know;

And I send thanks out in the dark
For comforting me so!

Boarding House for
Feathered Folk

JULIETTE LAINE

NYONE- who has a cheerful room
with space to hang a few bird-cages
can easily earn an income which may
range from pin money to a full—sized in-
come, without specialized training or
equipment. So says Dorothy Reynolds, a
little High School girl of Los Angeles,
Calif.

Dorothy remains at home during her
vacations in order to act as nurse to her
invalid mother, who is conﬁned to a wheel-
chair. Last summer she read an an-
nouncement from a local pet shop, say-
ing that canaries, parrots, and other
birds would be boarded and cared for at
the rate of $1.00 per week.

As Dorothy read it she Visualized the
place and thought of all the unpleasant
features of such a boarding house. A pet
shop usually smells of disinfectants, and
of dogs, cats, monkeys, etc. There is
constant noise, and usually a draft from
the inevitable opening and closing of
street doors. The chattering of parrots,
the yipping of puppies, and the plaintive
meowing of kittens would surely annoy
other, more sensitive animals, and over
and under it all would be the dismally in-
different atmosphere of a shop instead of
a home.

Surely, thought Dorothy, most persons
would prefer to board their pets with
someone who would give them individual
care, and hang them in a sunny living-
room or a screened back porch, away
from unpleasant odors and noises.

She put her ad. in the paper and waited.

OUR DUMBIANIMALS

But she did not wait
long. The response
was immediate and
gratifying, and in a
few weeks Dorothy’s
boarding house for
birds became so pop—
ular that the little
boarders’ owners
were having to make
reservations in ad-
vance. This is par-
ticularly the case
during the summer
months when pet
owners like to go on
vacation with a clear
conscience concern-
ing the welfare of
their live stock, and,
as a result, Dorothy
is making a tidy sum
which she is invest-
ing in Defense
Bonds. “It is easy
and I enjoy it, be-
cause I am very fond
of birds,” says Dor-
othy. “I can do it
without interfering
with my other house—
work, and I would

suggest it to any girl
who needs to earn her own spending
money, but who must do so while re-
maining at home.”

Alike Yet Unlike

L. E. EUBANKS

BOTH cats and dogs have tails, of
course, and both use them in ex-
pressing their feelings; but whereas the
dog’s wagging tail is indicative of glad-
ness and friendliness, the swing or
twitch of a cat’s tail shows either anger
or excitement, as when Puss is about to
spring at a bird or a mouse.

A dog cannot sheathe his claws, but
a cat can—and if well—bred, does, except
when the claws are really needed.

The brown bear is a good tree—climber,
yet his cousin the grizzly is unable to
climb trees. And while the brown bear
is a vegetarian, and usually harmless,
the grizzly is ready to kill when hungry.

Many species of animals are horned,
but horns show remarkable differences.
The cow’s horn is hollow, and is really
horn; the elephant’s tusks are virtually
solid and are of ivory; the horn grow—
ing over the nose of the rhinoceros is
made of closely compressed hair and is
far tougher than either of the others.

If you watch cows and horses in a
ﬁeld, you will see that when a cow gets
up from the lying position the hind quar-
ters rise ﬁrst; but with a horse it’s the
other way.

Both wasps and bees have poison-
bearing stings, but when they are ex-

amined under a glass, the difference
becomes obvious. While the sting of
the wasp is smoother than the most
beautifully made needle, that of the bee
is barbed. That is why the bee dies
after stinging a person; it isn’t killed
by “human poison” as some humorist
suggested, but is fatally wounded in the
struggle to extricate the stinger.

Young rabbits are born underground,
and are blind and almost naked at birth;
but hares are born in the open, are
covered with fur, and are able to see
and move about soon after arriving.

Among the birds, we ﬁnd the ostrich
an expert runner (of surprising speed)
but unable to ﬂy; while the swallow, a
regular acrobat in the air, has legs so
short that it’s only with the greatest
difﬁculty that it can walk on the ground.
Also, as opposed to birds that cannot
ﬂy, there are animals that can—the bat
and the so-called “ﬂying” squirrel, for
instance.

Butterﬂies and moths both ﬂy, but the
former settle with the wings held up
vertically, while the moth folds them on
the body.

A boy was a Witness in court, and the
lawyer in cross—examination said: “Did
anyone tell you what to say in court?”

“Yes, sir.”

“I thought so. Who was it?”

“My father, sir.”

“And what did he tell you?”

“He said the lawyers would try to get
me all tangled up, but if I stuck to the
truth I would be all right.”

A VIRGINIA RAIL GUARDING HER NEST

 

Invite the Birds

EVELYN B. WITTER

UST look at that ﬂock of birds com—

ing back to us from the South,”

I remarked to my husband one day in

March as we were laying out our garden
plot. ‘

“I’m sure glad to see them,” he re-
marked, turning his eyes Skyward. “We
need them so badly to protect our gardens
from harmful insects. Say, they must
be tired and hungry after their long
journey. They’ll be needing homes, too.”

“And our modern civilization is hard
on them,” I observed, following his trend
of thought. “They need our help as much
as we need theirs.”

“U-huh,” he agreed.

“I wish some of them would settle with
us,” I told Bill as I thought of the robin
drama I had enjoyed from my kitchen
window the spring and summer before.
It had lightened my household tasks to be
able to look up into the old elm tree and
see ﬁrst the nest-building activities, then
the coming of three bright—eyed babies,
the industrious parents feeding their
young, the young ones’ test ﬂights, and
ﬁnally their noisy departures. Every
day I had looked forward to a‘new scene
in the robin drama, and when they left
for a warmer climate I realized how much
pleasure they had given me.

“Why don’t you invite the birds?” Bill
queried. “ ‘ f?

I laughed out loud at the thought of
engraved invitations to the birds.

Bill dropped his spade and with a know—
ing smile went into the house. He soon
returned with bread crumbs, bits of ab-
sorbent cotton, shreds of linen, and small

separated ﬁbers from a piece of rope. He
spread these things out under the old elm
tree.

“There are your
birds,” he said.

It wasn’t very long before another
ﬂight of birds came into View. This time
they did not ﬂy past us. They saw our
invitations and accepted them.

That spring and summer our garden
was almost free of destructive insects.
There were melodious bird activities in
the trees around our house that gladdened
our hearts.

Now we send out invitations to the

The Virginia Rail
B R U c E_ B R o w N

ALE and female Virginia rails are
practically indistinguishable. They
incubate their eggs in alternate relays,
ﬁrst the mother, then the father. As in
gallinules, the young birds may be hatch-
ing over a period of several days. When
enemies are near the adults carry their
young to safety.

The Virginia rail is about nine and
one-half inches long. It is found in sum—
mer in the marshlands from southern
British Columbia to New Brunswick,
south to Baja California, Utah, southern
Ohio, and eastern North Carolina. The
birds spend the winters from the south-
ern part of their breeding range south
to Florida, Mexico and Guatemala.

Their call sounds like “ticket-ticket-
ticket,” or “racket—racket-racket.” Nests
are built of dead rushes, rather deeply
hollowed, and are placed just above the
water. Occasionally two birds lay in the
same nest and from ﬁve to twelve eggs,
creamy-buff in color with spots of red-
dish brown, are laid. The female pulls
down the surrounding tips of sedges and
rushes to make a roof over the nest which
she is very particular about keeping in
place. While they are incubating their
eggs the Virginia rails bravely remain
on the nest in spite of marauders, some-
times attacking molesting ﬁngers.

 

birds regularly, not just in the spring of
the year, but the whole year through.
The birds who do not ﬂy South for the
winter are in dire need of shelter and
food through the cold months and they
accept our invitations even more eagerly
than their migratory relatives.

Where the pasture grass is deep
The new calf likes to go to sleep.

Veer

Through the warmest part of day
He has no wish to run and play.

He hears a lullaby by bees,
Grows unaware of half he sees.

The long thick lashes shade his eyes,
He quivers in his sleep and sighs.

And through his little caltish mind
No doubt some lovely dreams unwind

Until the coolness wakes him up,
Reminding him it's time to sup.

He hears his mother’s chiming bell
And knows that everything is well.

She speaks to him low-toned and sweet;
He goes to her on flying feet.

Ferociously he drinks his till,
And while the day grows dim and still

He thinks it is the time to play,
Kicks up his heels and runs away.

He trolics with an elf-like grace,
With gladness on his little face.

The Picture on the Cover

“Prince Max” Now a Technical Sergeant
in the Army

HIS month’s frontispiece presents

“Prince Maximilian,” a male pedi-
greed Great Dane a year and a half old,
which was given recently by the Angell
Memorial Animal Hospital to the boys of
the Third Replacement Depot at Camp
Edwards, Massachusetts. The beautiful
dog had been brought to the Hospital by
Mr. Foster E. Allison of 57 Windsor
Road, Wellesley Hills, who speciﬁed that
it should be turned over to some branch
of the armed forces. The boys at the Camp
had heard of similar canine pets being
given to other units of the service and
to make sure that they might secure this
one, four of them, First Sergeant Fred
C. Libby, Technical Sergeant Albert
Fournier, Private Fordon Sol, and Ser-
geant Stanley J. Wicko (named in the
order they appear in the picture, from
left to right), drove up from Camp Ed-
wards to the Hospital building on Long-
wood Avenue, Boston, where the gift
was received in the presence of repre-
sentatives of the press. Immediately
“Prince Max,” as he was affectionately
nicknamed, was inducted into the Army
and promoted to the rank of Technical
Sergeant, as his certiﬁcate, ofﬁcially
signed by the Captain in charge, shows.

Wildlife Coming Back

HENRY H. GRAHAM

LOSED hunting seasons have proved
to be a great boon to several forms
of wildlife whose ranks were thinning
dangerously. Statistics show that a num-
ber of species of such birds are increas-
ing in population, which should be wel-
come news to every lover of the outdoors.
Several years ago the trumpeter swan
was believed to be extinct. Then a small
ﬂock of these large and beautiful birds
was discovered. Full protection, of course,
was given them. Today there are many
more trumpeter swans than formerly,
though the number is still small.

In many western states lives a bird
known as the sage hen, a form of grouse.
It makes its home in the brushland soli-
tudes, seldom approaching civilized areas.
A few years ago sportsmen reported an
alarming shortage of these birds. This
was because of the sage hen’s habit of
congregating at the comparatively few
water holes to drink. Hunters would seek
them there, often wiping out whole
coveys.

For several years the sage grouse has
been protected in some states with the

result that it, like the trumpeter swan,
is increasing in number. Due to the
wholesale slaughter of other years the
species is still not numerous, but it is
making a comeback nevertheless. In
early days hunters reported seeing large
piles of dead sage hens that had been
shot and stacked and left on the brush-
land sands. This inexcusable destruction
did much to bring the bird to the point
of extinction, making drastic action by
lawmakers necessary.

Not only the trumpeter swan and sage
grouse but other birds that were once
rare are battling to preserve their species.
Aided by closed seasons and winters that
are not too harsh, they may be able to
travel a long way on the return trail.

The hooves of mountain sheep are
somewhat spongy or rubbery so that
they act something like shock absorbers
when the animals leap from one stony
crag to another.

members, protests the cruelty in training
animals for stage and screen perform-
ances. Write to 180 Longwood Avenue,

Maternal Instinct
A True Story

HE was a two-year-old Irish Setter
that had outgrown the narrow bounds
of a small city ﬂat. It was her good for-
tune to be given to a family who lived
in a lovely country home with spacious
grounds and a dense forest near by.
Not long after her arrival, a puppy, a
Gordon Setter, joined the household and
was at once adopted by the older dog,
who watched and guarded the little
puppy as one of her very own. One day
a gate was left open and the young
puppy wandered into the forest and
was lost.

The man of the house took his Irish
Setter into the woods to hunt for the
puppy. They spent hours searching to
no avail. The master returned home but
the Setter refused to accompany him.
Some time later a noise was heard at
the door. It was opened and there, stand-
ing on the step, was the Irish Setter
holding in her mouth by the back of its
neck the lost puppy. Mother instinct
had triumphed. PEARL B. TAIT

FELINE PERSONALITY

Cat Visits Dog’s Grave

THE following letter, written by'Paul
Watts of Sharon, Massachusetts, was

published in a recent issue of the Boston
Herald:

In this day of chaos, with thousands of
boys dying for the battle of freedom,
this little episode may not be of im-
portance, but to me it tells of the loyalty
of a cat.

I have an Angora cat named “Rags,”
now 14 years old, whom I raised from a
kitten. I don’t believe you could ﬁnd a
smarter or more beautiful one. Seven
months ago, while working in my plant,
I spied a little gray kitten, so weak and
crippled she could hardly walk. My heart
went out to her in the way she came to
me to pet and fondle her. I brought her
home, fed and nursed her back to health
and the little lady of no pedigree but full
of personality I named “Corky.” Rags,
the pet, took her into his heart, washed
and played with her just like a mother.
Old age meant nothing to Rags. He would
watch and protect her from harm.

Three days ago Corky escaped from
Rags’ watchful eyes, ran out into the
road and was killed. I laid her away in
our garden and, believe it or not, Rags
goes to her grave and lies there every
day. Dogs do this, but seldom a cat. So
I can truthfully say that Rags gave my
little lady seven happy months and was
loyal to her to the end.

The familiar “bob-white” call is used
exclusively by the male birds. The hen
bird never uses this call but makes use
of other calls telling her brood to “scat-
ter” or “covey” as desired, and they
quickly obey.

Summer days are glad days

In this cottage by the sea.
Strangers came, adopted me,

Side by side, by night and day.
I am a well-loved cat!

The house is empty now.

I mew and mew . . . there is no sound . . .
I run around from front to back . . .

I climb the windowsill.

I mew and cry and cry . . .

But still there’s no reply.

I claw the screen.

Get Inside, “Whitey” I

Mother cat was very dissatisﬁed with
conditions as she found them outdoors.
Her white kitten was in bad company.
Much better to get it inside—a dog was
out there!

So Mother dug her claws in the screen
door and pulled it open to let Whitey in-
side. This is now a daily performance.

Wildlife on Long Island

CHARLOTTE C. WEST, M.D.

OT so many years ago wildlife flour-
ished on Long Island. Except for
tropical animals, there was quite a vari—
ety, such as fox, raccoon, marten, musk-
rat, rabbit and even deer.

There are still miles of uncultivated
land 'on the island, where small animals
can be found, but with the steady en—
croachment of traﬂcic and trafﬁc lanes,
colonization of large tracts for commu—
nity centers, growing towns and cities,
the larger animals have practically been
exterminated.

The farmhouse is enclosed on one side
by a hedge, old and very dense. Here
each year quail nest and breed unmo—
lested by us. We love to hear their note,
“Bob White,” as it is relayed back and
forth among them, and as one_more
venturesome than the others appears on
the lawn and joyously and repeatedly
acclaims that he is “Bob White”!

To our great delight on rare occasions
a pheasant, with gorgeously colored tail
feathers sweeping majestically over the
grass, walks with great dignity acrOss
the lawn and disappears in the thicket
beyond.

Lovely beyond words is the scarlet
tanager; one couple, only one, favor us
each year, tarry for a brief stay, and
leave as suddenly as they appeared.
Eagerly we watch for the ﬂash of bril-
liant coloring in the trees as they dart
hither and yon, but never have we found
a nest or ﬂedglings.

Our farmer encourages bird life be-
cause birds feed upon the insects on all
the vegetation, both useful and orna-
mental. Through some occult means, the
birds know they are loved and wanted
and become unbelievably tame as they
hOp around beside the farmer in the
truck patches as he goes about his work,
and they chirp merrily while consuming
great quantities of food.

The squirrels are an interesting study
in themselves. We have several families
living in the trees close to the big house.
They visit among each other. Across the
road is a thickly wooded tract and during
a lull in human affairs a mother squirrel
will conduct a recent addition to her
family to some friends in the woods;
perhaps they will stay several hours mak—
ing new acquaintances. We see them
going back and forth, visiting each
other.

They are exceedingly wary and alert
to the slightest seeming danger. Their
bark is the only weapon they possess to
ward off intruders, or give warning of
some danger. There are several walnut
trees on the farm and in the fall the
little animals are busy laying in their
winter stores. It is said squirrels eat
eggs and small birds besides nuts; but

we have yet to see them molest a bird’s
nest.

WILD LIFE AT ITS BEST

The squirrels hibernate for the winter.
The birds leave early for parts north and
south, but many robins stay the year
around. Feeling that food may not al-
ways be available, we love to feed them
and it is strange that they never leave a
crust;—they show their appreciation like
a well-bred guest, by eating what is
offered them.

Speaking of well-bred guests, has it
ever occurred to you that animals are
natively and instinctively well-bred? If
you inadvertently hurt your dog, step on
his toes for example, which is so painful
and you show him your regret, he hastens
to tell you that it’s all right, he knows
you did not mean to do it. I wish human—
kind were equally sensitized.

The musicians at the Zoological Gar-
dens in Budapest several years ago had
an unusual listener among their music
lovers. It was a peacock resident of the
gardens. This peacock showed a marked
preference for the evening concerts.
Habitually it would take up its position
in the immediate vicinity of the orches-
tra and listen intently. Then one night,
perhaps moved by the music, and desiring
to contribute its share to the entertain-
ment, the peacock began to screech loudly.
The music of the peacock, however, did
not harmonize with the efforts of the
musicians, and the beautiful bird was
made to hear the concerts from a more
distant listening post.

 

Reasoning Animals
ALAN BROWN

l'HlHE late Dr. Raymond L. Ditmars,

famous curator of reptiles and mam-
mals at the New York Zoological Park,
records an instance of almost human in-
telligence among beavers, in his book
“Strange Animals I Have Known.” A
group of beavers at the zoo apparently
did not approve of the enclosure provided
for them. But during the ﬁrst day there
was no outward indication of this atti-
tude. The beavers spent the day busily
examining the four-foot fence enclosing
them, and looking over the brush, leaves
and branches supplied them for winter
quarters.

After dark, however, they went to
work. The branches were carried to a
point along the fence. Over the branches
were piled water-soaked leaves. Mixed
with the leaves they used sticky mud.
All these things were carried between
their paws and chins. By morning they
had built a ﬁne ramp leading to the top
of the fence. Had they been discovered
an hour later, wrote Dr. Ditmars, the
job would have been ﬁnished and all the
beavers would have walked across the
ramp to freedom.

Join the Jack London Club, and help
stop the cruelty in training animals for
stage or screen.

Salvatore Marsiglia

Leo, the lion, paces forth in his cage

Staring with eyes that are yellow and bright;

What, in their depths, but a smouldering
rage,

What, but the thought of a deep jungle
night?

Here, in confinement, the tiger stalks;
Beside him a leopard, gaudy and sleek;
There, a gorilla ponderously walks;
There, hordes of monkeys, futile and weak.

Hark to the sound of a macaw’s cry;
Hark to the flapping of colorful wings;
Gaze on a peacock majestically by—
Gaze on a horde of imprisoned things!

Here are the living who live in the past,
Once free and unhampered by curious men.
View them unfeelingly where they are cast—
One day they will rise triumphant again!

Why She Stays Away

Readers of Our Dumb Animals are
familiar with our Jack London Club, an
organized protest against the cruelty in
training animals for stage and screen.
A letter recently received contains the
following pertinent paragraph:

“Please enroll me as a member of the
Jack London Club. I never do go to
movies using animals anyway, for my
husband owned a theater for seven years
and I have spent winters in Hollywood
and know what animals suffer.”

For particulars about the Jack London
Club, with its 814,023 members, write to

“I’m Not Trapping”

RICHARD DUTTON

HE old man settled back in his

II chair, slowly removed his pipe from

his lips, and said,

“No, son, I’m not doing any trapping
this year—~nor any other year that I
know about. I ain’t set a trap for ten
years come December.”

“Why,” I protested, “I heard that you
once took the biggest bear pelt ever seen
around here. And isn’t it true that you
once caught a pure white beaver?”

“Yes,” he said, with a slow smile, “I
did that. I still have both of those skins.
But I’m not at all proud of them.”

“Why?” I asked, hoping to hear a
story.

For response he bent over and rolled
up his right trouser leg, exposing his
ankle. An ugly bump ran across his ankle
on both sides and the skin around it was
that bluish color peculiar to old scars.

“I stepped into a trap myself,” he
explained pointing to the scar. “A bear
trap. It near killed me.”

“Tell me about it,” I urged.

“I had seen bear signs over by Beaver
Brook.” the old fellow began, pufﬁng on
his corn-cob, “so I set a trap there. I
stretched wire around it so’s to keep
anyone from stepping in it. Even posted
signs saying there was a bear trap set
theref’

“One Winter night I went out to look
at the trap. I had “Rocky,” my dog,
along with me. There was quite a bliz—
zard blowing; it was cold enough to
freeze the tail off a brass baboon, and
I wasn’t feeling any too spiffy to begin
with. I had just gotten over a bad cold.

“The snow blew in my face so much

  
   

TOO OFTEN THE VICTIMS OF CRUEL STEEL TRAPS

that at last I couldn’t see where I was
going. When I thought I was pretty
near the trap I called Rocky over to me
so he wouldn’t step in it and began feel-
ing around with my feet for the wire.
Had my lantern with me, of course, but
it warn’t much help in that storm.

“Like a blundering old fool that I was
I never ﬁggered that the snow had
drifted up over the wire. I stepped right
plump into the trap. Worst thing that
ever happened to me.

“Well, sir, I tried unclamping those
great steel jaws with my hands but I
couldn’t budge them. Rocky was still at
my side, whining. I tried sending him
back to camp ’cause then Jim and Charlie
would know that something was wrong
and come out after me. At last he went
but you could tell he didn’t want to
leave me. Rocky was a good dog.

“Then my lantern went out. I didn’t
miss the light so much, but it had kept
my hands warm. Then my leg began to
throb ﬁt to bust. Up till then it hadn’t
pained much but just felt hot and numb.

“My hands and face got so cold that
I thought I was going to freeze before
anyone could ﬁnd me. The pain in my
leg kept getting worse and worse. I
couldn’t stand it any longer and began
to whimper like a baby.

“Rocky managed to ﬁnd his way back
to camp and his scratching made Jim
open the door. He and Charlie near had
a ﬁt when they saw poor, old Rocky all
alone. They bundled up and came out
looking for me. When they found me I
was more dead than alive. Rocky was
an old dog and the trip through the
storm had exhausted him. He died that
night.

“Well, I was laid up a long time with
that bad leg, and I had plenty of time to
think. And I couldn’t help thinking that
every time an animal—beaver, bear or
what have you—steps into a trap he goes
through the same thing I did, only I got
out of it with my skin and they gener-
ally don’t. And another animal, a dog,
had given up his life so that I might
escape from a trap. That’s why I’m not

settin’ any traps this year—or any other
year!”

Smart Boys

According to the Associated Press,
Bobby Hardy, ﬁve, and his younger
brother walked into the city hall of
Quincy, Illinois, recently, and asked
Police Clerk Jack Pottel: “Have you any
ﬂoors we can scrub?”

“Why?” asked the clerk. “Well,” said
the boy, “it’s like this. We got a dog, but
no dollar for a license.” They got the
job, and the dog got the license.

What Is a Pedigree-Dog?

What is a pedigree-dog? It is simply
one whose progenitors have been ad-
judged champions at Shows on points
which are largely arbitrary and often
most undesirable. The easiest way to
produce such a creature is to mate two
champions. This inevitably means dys-
genic in—breeding, and the animal which
satisﬁes the ring judge by the prick of its
ears or some such nonsense may be little
better than a neurotic invalid, with
brains on a par with its stamina. Here,
as in so many other instances, human
commercialism has been the curse of the
animal creation. — The Animals’ Friend

Veterinary Column

1. Question: I have a female pointer,
three years old, who has had one litter
of puppies, and now I wish to have her
spayed. Do you advise doing this before
the hunting season?

Answer: NO, not if you plan to hunt
the dog this fall. Whereas, all outward
indications of the operation disappear
within a week or two, the dog has been
through a major operation, and Should
be allowed ample time to return to nor-
mal. A mature dog, especially one which
has had puppies, undergoes more shock
and the period of repair is longer than
in a young unbred animal. Since the
period of training and the hunting sea-
son are extensive and arduous, it would
not be wise to subject the dog to them
unless at least two months had elapsed
Since the operation.

2. Question: What is the best treat—
ment for hair balls in a Persian cat?

Answer: Long—haired cats are fre-
quently troubled with the accumulation
of hair in the stomach and intestines,
due to swallowing the hair in the process
of cleaning themselves. Frequent brush-
ing and combing aids in preventing this
condition by removal of dead hair from
the body. Also the administration of
mineral oil, about a tablespoonful every
ten days, is helpful.

3. Question: I Should like to buy my
puppy a ball to amuse him, but friends
have advised against it. I am sure that
he would enjoy one, and I Should like to
know the objections, if any.

Answer: Dogs can derive pleasure
from a ball and often enjoy retrieving
it for the owner. However, the ball
Should be large enough so that there is
no possibility that the dog may get it
stuck in his throat or swallow it. Fre-
quently, we hear of difﬁculties arising
due to the presence of a ball or other
small object becoming lodged in the
throat, stomach, or intestines. The con-
sequences may be serious, interfering
with the taking and digesting of food by
the dog. If not removed, fatal results
may ensue.

Dogs Should not be allowed to play
with small balls or Similar objects which
might be swallowed. If such an acci-
dent occurs, a veterinarian should be
consulted without delay, as surgical in-
tervention is often necessary.

R. M. B., Veterinary Dept.

Dog licenses are ﬁrst recorded during
the reign of Henry III of England,
(1207-—1272) when all persons owning
mastitis were required to take out li-
censes.

Lecture by Mr. Burgess

T is not a new thing for the Massa-
chusetts S. P. C. A. to advertise Mr.
Thornton W. Burgess as its feature lec-
turer in Boston on Humane Sunday.
For several years he has thrilled audi—
ences that have crowded the lecture hall

Defense in the Animal World

W. J. BANKS

 

 

FAMOUS DEFENSIVE FORMATION OF MUSK-OXEN

HE animal people may claim to

have invented most of our modern

ideas of defense. The methods em-
ployed by the wild folk to protect them-
selves from their natural foes include
such up-to-date schemes as armor plating
and barbed-wire entanglements. Others
eject poison gas or liquids, or cover their
retreat by smoke screens.

Then, too, almost every wild species
is more or less camouﬂaged to blend into
its natural background. Some change
the shade of their coat to suit the sea—
sons, while others, like the chameleon
and cuttleﬁsh, alter their appearance at
will. One lizard sheds its squirming tail
to attract the enemy while it sneaks
away to grow a new one.

The skunk might teach any army com-
mand something about gas attacks. The
tiny West African shrew also can make
a colossal smell. The llama, if annoyed,
may favor you with a shower of acrid
saliva. ‘

The smoke-screen is the invention .of
the cuttleﬁsh, who belches forth a sepia—
colored liquid while he changes his own
color. Then he swerves while the pur-
suer follows the dark smoke-screen.

The porcupine with his 25,000 quills
must be credited with an improvement
on the barbed-wire entanglement scheme.
The pack rats of the American deserts
pile defense lines of prickly cactus
around their nests, giving many an
impetuous coyote sore feet.

The slow—poke tortoise can’t outdis-
tance any foe, so he must depend upon
his claw—proof covering within which
head and legs can be drawn. The arma-
dillo is another animated tank and, with

his saw-edged shell covering, he can
hand out punishment as well as take it.

Co—operation in defense against ene-
mies who could overcome a single victim
easily is fairly common in nature. The
musk-ox is a ﬁrm believer in the “united
we stand” policy. When attacked by dogs
or wolves the polar oxen adopt their
famous formation with calves in the
center, bulls and stronger cows present-
ing a formidable array of horned heads.

Slashing teeth and claws, Strong legs
and sharp hooves are not always enough,
and lacking specialized equipment as
described above many species must de-
pend for survival on speed to escape
natural enemies. This is the commonest
advantage of the weak over the strong.
Thus the white—tailed deer is perhaps
two miles an hour faster than the wolf,
while the jack rabbit possesses a similar
slender advantage over the fox. So
nature maintains her balance, only upset
permanently by man’s guns and traps,
cunning and greed.

Ants have community nurses who con-
trol the temperature in the ant nests,
prevent disease, maintain cleanliness,
bathe and exercise the ant children, care
for the eggs, and in general serve their
communities very much as nurses serve
man.

The hummingbird is an interesting
little fellow. He cannot walk, uses his
feet only for perching, and always uses
his wings when he wants to move. He
can ﬂy in any direction—forward, back-
ward, sidewise, up, or down. No other
bird can ﬂy backward.

Guineas Show Grief
L U T H E R C L A R K

UINEA fowls are, in a clannish way,

among the most social beings I
know. When I hunted guinea nests on
the farm there was invariably a lookout
posted some distance from the nest to
warn laying hens of my approach. That
warning is a peculiar purring call un-
like any other sound they make. Mem-
bers of a ﬂock are devoted to other mem-
bers but pay little attention to members
of other ﬂocks. It is quickly obvious to
a close observer that they have some
method of communication among them-
selves, and that they have almost human
methods of showing emotion.

Sometime ago I had this tragically
and forcefully impressed upon me. We
were driving through a farm section
when a guinea ﬂock appeared beside the
road. They had planned to cross but
saw the motor and the leader turned
back, followed by all the others excepting
one. The exception was a young cock,
full of the foolhardiness of youth. He
hesitated, then dashed boldly into the
road and came to a full stop not over
ten feet in front of the radiator.

We could not dodge or stop in time;

J une, 1942

 

“SUGAR,” LOST DOG FROM NEW JERSEY, AT ANGELL

ANIMAL HOSPITAL
“Sugar,” found wandering on the streets by Boston Police, was taken to Angel]

Animal Hospital, March 31.

He bore a 1941 New Jersey dog license tag, and,

after much correspondence, two weeks later came ﬁnal word that Mrs. Le'e Reichter,
of Foster Street, Newark, was his owner. Sugar was so named by Hosp1tal attend-

ants because of his sweet disposition.

He improved greatly in looks during his

Hospital experience, and many requests came for his adoption. These were refused
to the great satisfaction of the Hospital authorities when, ﬁnally, his real owner
was found. He was carefully crated and shipped to the New Jersey address.

 

the front of the car broke his neck. We
stopped within a few feet, in time to wit-
ness an almost incredible sight. These
shy fowl, heedless of all possible person-a1
[danger to themselves, were racing to
their fallen companion in a body. With
a concerted and mournful vclacking sev-
eral of them seized him by the wing
feathers and, tugging in perfect team-
work, dragged him from the road to the
hedge beside it.

There they gathered in a tight cir-
cle around him and waited in an atti—
tude of dejected suspense for some sign
of recovery. After watching them two
or three minutes we drove away, but I
will always wonder how long they re-
mained and what they eventually did
about it.

That funereal memory, however, has
stuck with me ever since, especially
when driving. I am sure it helped to
make me a more careful driver. That
group was just like a human family
gathered around a stricken child.

Girl Scouts Join Band

A pleasing episode during Be Kind to
Animals Week in Mount Clemens, Michi-
gan, was the meetings of various troops
of Girl Scouts with Mrs. Beatrice Dahms,
secretary of the Macomb County Hu-
mane Society. The members have learned
about the care of animals and how to
treat them in war-time emergency, and
have become so enthusiastic in their
study of animals that each of the four
groups of Girl Scouts is to be organized
also as a Band of Mercy.

Dogs and Cats Find Homes

As the result of a full hour’s Be Kind
to Animals program in the Carroll Street
school, Beaumont, Texas, Mrs. Vida B.
Reed Young informs us that ﬁfteen dogs
from the local pound and twelve cats
were placed in homes, and that there
were more children who were seeking
dogs and cats as pets.

They, Too, Also Serve

JOHN P. DINNENY

N this war to the death with barba—

rism many of our dumlb animal friends
have also been called to the colors. It is
obvious on all sides of us. Horses are
replacing motor cars, cows are produc—
ing more milk, hens more eggs, bees
more honey, and right on down the line
every creature that has ever contributed
to our material comfort is enlisted for
victory in an all out effort of labor and
production.

Of great importance, too, is the nour—
ishment of spirit which we can derive
from our silent allies, particularly those
of us who have come to look upon dumb
creatures quite apart from their mate—
rial value. In them we ﬁnd relaxation;
we forget for a brief moment the horror
and terror of war. The lonely heart
aching for those gone to battle ﬁnds
solace in the playful antics of the family
dog. Or it may be the more quiet kitty
who eases herself reassuringly into our
lap to interrupt a train of morbid
thought with her comforting companion-
ship. Or the friendly bird gaily thank-
ful for the bits of bread and blithely
chirping of happier days to come, gives
us an inner lift nowhere to be found in
meaningless talk, squawking radios, or
glaring headlines.

To be sure such brief moments in
themselves will not win the war. But
they open up a hazy, yet meaningful
vista in which every dumb creature sym-
bolizes the calmness and serenity of
spirit with which Nature originally en-
dows all her offspring. The animal
kingdom, more loyal to Nature than we,
is not beset by the torturing doubts and
fears that engulf us. It possesses an
inner immutability, not upset by man—
made externals, which gives us an as-
surance that this war will pass and that
peace will once again cast its hallowed
light about us.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

With this consolation from our dumb
friends comes a primarily subconscious
resolve that it must be our kind of peace,
a peace in which our American ideal of
the brotherhood of man becomes a throb—
bing, dynamic reality rather than a
beautiful but lifeless phrase. Our per—
sonal worries pale beside the great task
which lies ahead for a united all. We
return to our jobs, however insigniﬁ-
cant or humble, grimly determined to
pay to the limit in blood, sweat and
tears to the end that our ideal of peace
will prevail for millenniums to come. And
when the task seems most hopeless, when
defeat and calamity shroud us with ter—
rible misgivings, we do well to return
to our animal pets, to the dumb habi-
tants of ﬁeld, wood and countryside,
there once more to revivify our jaded
spirits with a truly inner solace which
they alone can give.

 

IN THE EDITOR’S LIBRARY

 

RING UP THE CURTAIN, Cecilia Mary
Young.

Here is a serious volume of nearly 300
pages devoted entirely to the amateur
theater in all its phases. The author has
made a life work of the subject, having
formerly published a very successful “Cat—
alogue and Review of Plays.” While the
book is written primarily for the use of
Catholics, it is so complete and contains
so much general information that it will
prove very helpful to all who are inter-
ested in amateur play production. It takes
35 pages to list all the plays which are
given under 31 headings, including Chil-
dren’s, Schools, Christmas, Operettas, One
Act, Home, and Radio. Brief descriptions
are given, the number of characters listed,
price of play and name of publisher, and
amount of royalty, if any. There is also
a list of books and publishers on Produc-
tion.

The Preface refers to the living actors
and animals introduced into a Nativity
play by St. Francis. In “Rural or Country
Theater,” seven plays dealing sympatheti-
cally with animals are listed. Certainly
such a book as this should be available to
all public school teachers as well as to those
in Parochial schools. It should be of easy
access to all who deal with amateur plays.

Man’s Ally—the Pig

E. VON ROTHSCHILD

OMESTIC swine should rank high ~

in the catalogue of man’s animal
friends for fewer beasts have a longer or
more honorable history of domestication.
Archeologists have found the bones of
domesticated pigs in buried cities of the
past. Mandarins in silken robes sat
down to feast on pork-chops thousands
of years before the Christian era. The
toga clad Romans and the Greeks of
classical antiquity knew of roasted pork.
In Medieval Europe hog meat was the
piece de resistance of the nobility, grac-
ing the groaning board with the tradi-
tional apple in his mouth which some say
was to pacify Sir Hog for having given
up his earthly existence to satisfy man’s
gastronomic cravings.

The pig is not the ﬁlthy animal which
is so often represented. Only when his
keeper permits him the tiny conﬁnes of
a pen little larger than is necessary to
turn around in does he become malodor-
ous and unﬁt company for the discrim-
inating. In the wild state, as anyone who
has ever seen a wild hog knows, pigs are
clean animals. Even when domesticated,
pigs Will clean themselves if clear water,
such as a running brook is available. Of
course if there’s nothing but a mud hole
to cool off in, that must suﬁice, and the
porker gets a bad name. Pigs must cool
off or they’ll die. You would, too, if you
had a hundred or more pounds of fat
bacon covering your body. An old Shrop-
shire farmer achieved immortality by
that famous remark made while watch-
ing his own hogs playing in the wallow:
“Rightly are they called swine,” he
said. But pigs are not naturally dirty
and they prefer clean forage, range, and
bedding if it is within reach.

One fact about the pig which is little
known is that his teeth are similar to
those of a human being. Biologists as-
sert that omnivorous diet is the reason
for the striking similarity. The only
other animal who like man will eat
almost anything is the bear, and his
teeth, too, are similar to a human’s with
the exception of the overdeveloped ca—
nines. In the pig, however, it takes an
expert to distinguish between the molars

of a full grown porker and those of an
adult human.

Right now Mr. Piggy is a key link in
building national health. Nutritionists
tell us that pork and bacon are rich
sources of Vitamin B, the vitamin most
often lacking in sub-standard diets.
Authorities agree that whole sections of
the country, notably the South and
Southwest, would long ago have fallen
prey to serious nutritional deﬁciencies
if it were not for the high place on the
menu of pork and pork products.

Reindeer

deer only in a zoo, but not so in

Alaska. Great herds are seen
crossing the broad white wastes and,
hitched to sleds, they often streak across
the country, looking not unlike the pic—
tures of the team we associate with
Santa Claus.

Alaskan reindeer are very useful,
and while they are not quite as tame and
friendly as horses are in the States,
they are nearly so. They .are driven
much the same as horses, but one rein-
deer is usually hitched ahead of the other
instead of at his side. There are almost a
million of them in Alaska at present and
the number is increasing every year.

But, strangely enough, though they
are so much at home in Alaska, they are
what you might call naturalized citizens.
The United States Government ﬁrst
brought sixteen of them from Eastern
Siberia to Teller Mission on Seward
Peninsula. That was only about ﬁfty
years ago. Later Uncle Sam brought over
a thou-sand more, because he saw that
they would help the Eskimos and Indians
to gain their living.

These reindeer were ﬁrst distributed
by the missionaries to the Eskimos.
But Uncle Sam knew that the Eskimos
at that time did not know how to take
care of reindeer, for they had never
even seen one. The Lapps from Lapland
had tended reindeer all their lives, so
Uncle Sam brought over, with the rein-
deer, enough Lapps to teach the Eskimos
and later the Indians of Alaska just how
to take care of the animals. The Eskimos
liked the Lapps and many of them re-
mained in Alaska, though the Eskimos
and Indians now know all about tending
reindeer. Reindeer graze on lichens and
the so—called reindeer moss which is very

PEOPLE generally have seen rein—

plentiful along the Bering Sea coast.

There got to be too many reindeer for
the Eskimos and Indians to handle, so
Uncle Sam allowed them to sell part of
their herds to the white men. That is
how the white men got to owning great
herds of reindeer. Even a young white
woman, Miss Ruth Reet, bought a herd
of reindeer and herded them hundreds
of miles across Alaska.

The reindeer are important in many
ways. To start with they give milk. The
milk tastes like cow’s milk, only much
stronger—and the Lapps like it better.
The Eskimo women know nothing about
milking cows—I doubt if they ever saw
one—but they are very clever at milking
reindeer.~Reindeer are strong and on a
sled, even a single reindeer can haul all
the family goods as well as the family.

In bad years when the Eskimos have
trouble ﬁnding and landing a Whale, the
reindeer saves them from starvation.
They furnish both meat and clothing.
The white man buys his reindeer parkas
——those one-piece garments with at-
tached hood—from the Eskimos, and a
very ﬁne parka it is.

Once an Eskimo brought his team of
two reindeer down to Nome on Bering
Sea and said thatthey could run faster
than dogs. The white men who had dog-
teams laughed and said that dogs were
much faster. So they had a race. The
surprise was on the white men, for the
reindeer won. It’s very easy for rein-
deer to run ten miles an hour.

The American bison, or buffalo, has.
in a few instances, been crossed with
plains cattle; such a hybrid being known
as “cattalo.” Its meat is like that of our
beef cattle, but it has a heavy head,
something like that of the buffalo.

rescue pets that have fallen into them.
He is the fellow who possesses the im-
portant humane “it”; or, to put it another
way, he is the fellow who has a way
with animals, they instinctively like him
and he transmits to them a sense of
security and conﬁdence. Yes, this fellow
is a humane worker.

There is another chap that most of
us know. We meet him when we visit
our sister societies. He might be a big
fellow or a medium-sized fellow, heavy
or thin, but there is something serene
and calm about his entire makeup. He
seldom talks very much about his ex-
ploits, but if you quiz him about his
experiences he can tell you a book-full.
He’s the humane officer; sometimes he
wears a uniform and very often he works
in plain clothes. If you were to walk
down the street with him and not know
his occupation, you would soon ﬁnd out
if you were in humane work, because
every time a horse passed by on the
street he would follow it with experi—
enced eyes, and the least little fault
would be detected.

If it were something which should be
corrected, you would see him step out
and call the driver and correct whatever
was wrong. The courts in this country
have great conﬁdence and respect for
this type of humane ofﬁcer who never
brings cases to court if there is another
way of adjusting the matter. Such
ofﬁcers are humane workers.

The public often believes that men
and women who serve as members of a
board of directors do so because they
are heavily remunerated for their serv-
ices to the Society. We know, of course,
that nothing could be further from the
truth. We could cite hundreds of in-
stances of devoted attention to the cause
which has kept men and women on boards
of directors, often against the advice of
their families, friends and physicians—
but their devotion has never ceased.

We could mention one man who, by
the measure of this world’s goods, must
be considered an extremely wealthy indi-
vidual. We don’t know how much money
he makes in a week or in an hour, but
very likely it is a very tidy sum. Yet
he never hesitates when called to a direc-
tors’ meeting, and patiently gives of his
great wisdom and knowledge in order
that the work of the Society he serves
may go ahead. Such men and women
are indeed humane workers.

Endowed stalls and kennels are needed
in the Angel] Memorial Animal Hospital.
Payments of thirty-ﬁve dollars for a
kennel or seventy-ﬁve dollars for a stall
will insure a suitable marker inscribed
with donor’s name. Terms of permanent
endowment of free stalls and kennels
will be given upon application to the
Treasurer, 180 Longwood Avenue, Boston,
Mass.

Bangor Humane Society

T the annual meeting of the Bangor
Humane society Edward I. Gleszer
was re-elected president and Miss Gladys
F. Taggett, the eﬁicient secretary and
humane education director, was also re-
elected. The Society is one of the
largest and most active in Maine. It
conducts a Shelter for needy cases. Just
now it is supplying leaﬂets on care of
pets in air raids.

The usual program on humane edu-
cation has been carried out in the schools.
Literature has been distributed to the
various rooms, and the usual story con-
test was conducted last spring. Twenty-
ﬁve of the Society’s medals were given
to boys and girls from the third through
the sixth grades for outstanding essays.
Through the courtesy of radio station
WABI a program was given on behalf
of Be Kind to Animals Week. Over a
hundred humane posters were used.

In 1941 the Society conducted 1,697
investigations, including 81 barns and
297 head of cattle. There was but one
court case, with conviction. Visitors at
the Shelter numbered 4,567.

The society is out of debt.

Other work done is listed as follows:
Horses destroyed, 17; cows destroyed, 1;
dogs taken to shelter, 417; dogs placed
in homes, 269; found owners of, 113;
cats taken to shelter, 158; cats placed

Robin Hotel

The Chamber of Commerce of Lewis
Chapel, near Chattanooga, Tennessee,
has a new approach to encourage visi—
tors to spend a few days in the beautiful
mountains. They advertise truthfully
that even the robins travel for hundreds
of miles to spend the winter in that
section.

It is, of course, unusual for robins to
winter as far north as Tennessee, as
normally they ﬂy to the Gulf Coast; but
two winters ago, when Florida was
struck by a cold wave, the birds ﬂew
north and came to rest in Lewis Chapel.

Farmers and their families from far
and near come to this area to observe
the thousands of birds winterng in the
pine thicket which, according to natu—
ralists, is almost like a steam-heated
apartment.

We are glad to know that our friend,
the robin, is happily located in Tennes-
see, however, and look forward with real
anticipation to his reappearance on our
lawns this coming spring. The robin is
a happy and most cheerful bird, bring-
ing much pleasure to mankind. We will
need him this spring more than ever.

New Defense Poster

HE talented artist, Mr. Mor-

gan Dennis, has skilfully com-
bined the idea of kindness to ani-
mals and service for national
defense in our new poster for
1942. Its attractiveness cannot be
realize-d from the above black and
white print, as the poster is litho-
graphed in the national colors.
The words, Be Kind to Animals,
appear on the upper third, which
is in red; the words, Join in Their
Defense, are printed on the middle
third, which is white; while the
bottom third is blue, with the
ﬁgure of the dog in black against
the background of all three colors.
It is an unusually handsome
poster which will be welcome in
any school—room, public assembly
place, or elsewhere.

How the manufacturers did it,
we do not know, but by some fore-
sight they were able to put out
this handsome poster in this year
of rising costs of paper and print—
ing with no extra charge over

 

cash, each; twenty-fourth to
thirty-third, one year’s subscription to
Our Dumb Animals (value, $1, each.)

2. The subjects must be either live
animals or live birds. Pictures of wild
animals in captivity such as squirrels,
skunks, etc., or of caged birds, are not
eligible. (No circus or hunting pictures
or those showing cruelty, considered).

3. The contest is open to all, but en-
tries will be accepted only from those
who have taken the photographs.

4. Only strictly original, hitherto un-
published photographs may be entered.

5. There is no limit as to size, but
we suggest approximately 3 x 4 to 4 x 6
inches, and no limit to the number that

6. Send no negatives, only good, clear
prints, preferably glossy ﬁnish. Size of
the ﬁgures is always considered.

7. All photographs must be marked
plainly on the back with the full name
and address of the sender. (Caution: Do
not mark backs of glossy prints so writ-
ing will show on surface. Attach label).

Humane Day in Schools

E urge all schools to observe a Hu-

mane Day either during Be Kind
to Animals Week or as near it as con-
venient. Friday, April 24, is the date
suggested for this year, although, due to
vacation, Friday, April 17, has been
ofﬁcially designated by the Superintend-
ent of Schools in Boston. To help ele-
mentary teachers everywhere celebrate
this Day, we have prepared an eight-page
leaﬂet of Humane Exercises, containing
poems suitable for recitation, hints on
the care and protection of animals, sub-
jects for composition, etc. It has a Fore-
word by Miss Alice B. Beal, State Super-
visor of Elementary Education. All
Massachusetts teachers will be supplied
as usual. Samples mailed free to any
address. For those outside of Massachu-
setts wishing a quantity, the price is
$1.50 per 100 copies. Address, Secretary,
Mass. S. P. C. A., 180 Longwood Ave.,

“Why a Humane Sermon”

Such is the title of a short leaﬂet by
President Francis H. Rowley, formerly
a minister, written especially for use in
connection with Humane Sunday. On the
back is a “three minute address for Hu-
mane Sunday,” entitled, “The Value of a
Sparrow.” Price, one cent each. Ameri~

Humane Sunday in Boston

As usual the Massachusetts S. P. C. A.
will recognize Humane Sunday, which
comes this year on April 19, with appro-
priate exercises through the co-operation
of the Boston Public Library. On that
afternoon, at 3:30 P. M., in the lecture
hall of the Library, Copley Square,
Thornton W. Burgess, the ever-popular
bedtime story-teller, will present an i1-
lustrated lecture on “Little Neighbors
in Fur and Feathers.” He will have a
number of new colored ﬁlms, illustrating
kindness to animals in most fascinating
ways. No more interesting or thrilling
animal talks are given anywhere than
those of Mr. Burgess.

Announcement will be made later of
the usual Humane Sunday afternoon
broadcast by officials of the M.S.P.C.A.

At Dawn

Kadra Maysi

At dawn they changed the shore patrol.
I heard the bombers, far away,

Converging. But, I also heard

The song with which a mockingbird
Salutes the breaking day.

He sang! Against the saffron dawn,

His music rose and swelled and spread
In silver fans— until its sound _
Was merged and completely drowned

By motors overhead.

I lay and heard the bombers pass

And watched the frightened pigeons fly
From roofs. And then I heard a trill . . .
The mockingbird was singing still

A rival to defy.

He had not left the Banksia rose

Which holds his nest. He did not cease
To sing. He sang more loud and high —
ln challenge to the roaring sky-—

His hymn of joy and peace.

Mrs. Cardinal Had Her Way

A. LEONARD BUTTS

HEN a cardinal decided to build

its nest in a cedar tree at the side
of our front porch, it conﬂicted with cer-
tain plans which we had made. It was
time for the usual spring arrangement
of our porch furniture, and also we
wanted to clean and wax the ﬂoor.

I watched that cardinal with keen in-
terest as it pulled tiny brown twigs from
around the bottom of the cedar and
placed them skillfully in forks of the tree.
A very neat nest, partly lined with small
scraps of paper, was soon constructed.

So the question to be decided was
whether to proceed with our work on the
porch, and endeavor to disturb the car-
dinal as little as possible, or wait until
the creature had ﬁnished with its nest.
Then I remembered a previous spring
when a cardinal had built its nest at one
end of the porch in a rosebush. Appar—
ently discovering that its location was
not private enough, the nest was never
used. Perhaps the same thing would

happen in this case; thus, we decided to
wait.

Dust accumulated on the porch ﬂoor,
but it remained unswept. In due time
three tiny bundles of baby cardinals
nestled in their cradle of twigs and
leaves. Indeed, the close—up glimpses of
the family routine of those cardinals was
compensation in abundance for our delay.

Frequently I placed sunﬂower seed
near the edge of the porch ﬂoor only
several feet from the nest. At such
times it was quite interesting to watch
the mother bird crack the seed and make
numerous trips to and from the nest.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

MOTHER SKIMMER AND

July, 1942

 

SAND-COLORED BABY

 

I observed that the male cardinal was
quite helpful too. On one occasion he
ﬂew to a branch of an elm, holding a
tender looking green worm in his bill.
As though pre-arranged, the female ﬂew
to the branch and took that little worm
in her bill and returned to her nest.

There is a vacant nest now in that
useful cedar, and we are a bit sorry that
our enjoyment was so brief. But, accord-
ing to nature, those little cardinals are
now ﬂying about with the guidance and
protection of their parents. Yes, we are
glad that we had some little part in mak-
ing that fact possible.

Faith in Humanity

One day every pedestrian passing the
governor’s residence in the ancient Swed-
ish city of Orebro was met by a duck
who looked up at him and squawked ex-
citedly. She evidently had an important
story to tell, but how understand her?
Finally the police ofﬁcer noticed that
after each speech she ran up to a tall
tree close to the castle. He followed, and
the duck ﬂew up to an old magpie’s nest
near the top of the tree. There she
stayed, looking down and continuing her
chattering. The man brought a ladder
and climbed up. He found the duck had
selected this nest as a comfortable place
to hatch her brood, but, alas! it was so
high above the water that she could not
possibly bring her little ones down. So
she decided to invoke human aid, and her
appeal was not in vain. The ofﬁcer car-
ried the downy nestlings down and placed
them gently in their native element.

J OHANNA R. M. LYBACK

Most fastidious of the animals is the
raccoon, which habitually washes his
food. Even if you hand him something
he is particularly eager for, he will de-
liberately rinse it in his water dish
before deigning to eat it.

The Black Skimmer

G. A. TIBBANS

EOPLE living along the seaboard

from Virginia to Mexico are familiar
with the strange bird usually known as
the “black skimmer,” but very few out—
side of that section have ever seen one.
Very many never even heard of it. This
sea bird is also known as the “cutwater,”
“shearwater,” and “scissorbill.”

The black Skimmers are exceedingly
noisy birds. They bark like dogs and if
a person scares up a number of them the
din that ﬁlls the air is equal to that from
several kennels of pups. The lower man-
dible of this curious bird is an inch or
more longer than the upper. The eggs
are laid in the sand that the sun may
help the mother bird in the hatching
process. No real nest is made, other than
the beach sand. The adult birds are
black and white, but their beaks are red
and white. They never go inland, nor do
they ﬂy very far out to. sea. The bird is
an excellent streamlined ﬂyer and will
swoop toward the water from above with
the speed of a dive bomber and dip some
distance into the water to pick up small
marine creatures upon which it feeds.
For her nest the mother skimmer makes
a hollow in the sand by slowly turning
her body round and round.

The bird is protected by the govern-
ment and “always hungry,” but since
it is protected it should be regarded as
another of mankind’s feathered friends,
although its voice is eXceedingly irritat-
ing to those who hear it.

The horned toad is no toad at all but a
lizard, and one of the few lizards that
can be picked up by the tail without hav-
ing the tail break off. He is a ferocious
looking little beast, a true monster in
miniature, but as an actual fact, he’s as
harmless as a kitten and makes a nice
pet.

Garden for Song
JESSIE M. DOWLIN

0 your planting in the spring not
only for vegetables, fruits, and
ﬂowers, but also for songs, and you will
be well repaid. Birds in a garden are
a joy to the eye and ear, and an aid to
cultivation, for many of them are help-
fully aware of the insects that must be
taken care of if the garden is to thrive.
If a border hedge will not shade the
main plot too much, plant thickly the
vigorous, fruiting shrubs, and then let
wild grapevine and wild cucumber trail
over them. These will make a dense
growth not easily accessible to maraud-
ing cats, and will attract the birds in
greater numbers. Catbirds and others

like to nest in thickets, and if youicater
to their tastes, even in a town you may
have some welcome bird guests who
would build homes along country road-
sides otherwise. '

THE SNOWFLAKE—A BIRD OF
THE NORTH

Among shrubs particularly attractive
to birds are the wild cherry, barberry,
chokecherry, elderberry, and wild rose,
all of which add beauty to the garden
from season to season. And of course,
if you have room, there are trees like
the shadblow, ﬂowering dogwood, moun-
tain ash, and buckthorn which will draw
innumerable varieties of birds to your
grounds.

The heads of sunﬂowers are eagerly
sought by the little yellow warbler and
other small birds, and though the com-
mon sunﬂower may be too tall and out
of place in the little garden, there are
many smaller types now which bear

   

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

charming blossoms plentifully.

The seed heads of cosmos should be
left in quantity for the autumn days
when the goldﬁn-ches, already duskily
clothed for the coming winter, love to
swing upon them, voicing their up and
down lilt while they {feast on the little
seeds.

If you want the lovely evening gros-
beaks to gladden some winter day for
you, then you should have a box elder
tree which will be covered with winged
seed pods after all the leaves have left
it. A ﬂock of ﬁfteen or twenty of the
grosbeaks will strip a fairly large tree
in a few days, and while their large
bills gather in the seeds, the stripped
husks make a pretty sight as they drift
down the wind like ﬂuttering gray moths.

Shrubs make a pleasing background
for the birdbath, without which no
garden planting seems quite complete.
Growth should not be too thick about
the base of the bath, but rather clear so
the birds may be aware of freedom from
danger. A near-by rose trellis or bit of
fencing and a convenient tree are neces-
sary preening spots, because the birds
cannot ﬂy far until they have dried their
feathers after a dip.

Two or three birdbaths are even bet-
ter than one, since some birds, robins
having been noted particularly, are in-
dividualists ﬁnding it objectionable to
bathe in mixed company. If you observe
closely, you will discover many interest-
ingly individual characteristics in your
bird friends, and your delight in their
varied songs will make your garden
truly an Eden.

Mark Twain and Animals

In histories of the life of Samuel L.
Clemens we ﬁnd only a few references
to animals in his household or to those
loved by him, yet he gave most remark-
able proof of his real affection for them.

Leading to the house overlooking El-
mir-a, New York, where he spent many
of his summers and where some of the
best loved of his work was done, there
is a long steep hill at the top of which
is his studio (still kept as it was when
he used it). From this he could look
down the road at the horses, often hot
and thirsty, pulling their heavy loads.

In 1874 he had great watering—troughs
built atsstrategic points on this hill.
Water was piped to them from never
failing springs, and provision was made
for carrying off the overﬂow. Each of
these troughs supplying water to thirsty
animals was in a way a memorial to one
of his children. A name and the date
was inscribed where it could be read by
the driver as he waited for his team to
refresh itself and perhaps give thanks
to the man who in this practical way
evinced his love for animals.

Britain’s Canaries Sing On
E . R . Y A R H A M

IN London, the Border Country, Scot-

land, Yorkshire, Lancashire, and
Norfolk thousands of working-class
houses are teeming with melody. Back-
bedrooms, sheds in the gardens, all kinds
of outhouses are full of song.

For these are the places where
Britain’s famous canaries are kept.
Neither the war nor the even closer
bombs can stop their singing. They have
reason to be joyful for they are among
the best cared for birds in the world.
One might even say, with truth, they are
pampered.

Just now the breeders are preparing
for their busiest season—spring. Some
idea of the extent of the industry is evi-
dent from the statement that in peace-
time one canary breeding area sends
50,000 birds to New York a year and
thousands of others to India. Another
has an annual turnover of $250,000.

Many of the breeders are now serving
in Britain’s armed forces but their wives
are carrying on till they return. For it
is still in the main a workingman’s hobby.
An average bird fetches $4, but cham-
pions sell for anything up to $1.60. Some
breeders have turned a hobby into a pro-
fession. A year or two back an old York-
shire breeder died leaving the respectable
sum of $20,000. He had been able to buy
a row of cottages and turn them into a
little factory, where men were employed
making cages and teaching the young-
sters to sing. .

About four centuries of careful breed-
ing have altered the original stock out of
recognition. The wild bird is ﬁve and a
half inches long, but one well-known d-o-
mevsticated variety, the Belgian, is usually
eight inches long. There are all kinds of
variations of the main type, which fan-
ciers know well, such as hooped or bowed
canaries, feather-footed types, and top-
knots, which have a distinct crest on the
head. Yorkshire canaries are long and
elegant, those from Norwich, short and
chubby.

The most trying part of the breeder’s
job is teaching the young birds, which
have naturally ﬁne voices but improve
immensely with careful tuition. Some—
times a breeder will rub a cork on to a
moist bottle, and even this strange sound
will incite the birds to rivalry. Another
dodge consists in taking the young birds
in cages to nightingale districts.

Norwich has a noted canary “college”
where a kind of organ is used to teach
the birds. They learn the simple ca-
dences ﬁrst, gradually progressing to the
harder ones. Three to four months are
necessary to produce a well-trained bird.
Experts can quickly detect a trained bird
by the way it uses its beak and how it
produces its song.

Under This Tree
Judy Van der

If I were to stay here all day long
Under this tree,
The squirrels would come around
To look at me.

Veer

If I could be very quiet
Like a log, still,

Deer might come wandering
Down the hill.

There would be brown faces and bright eyes
Of rabbits peering.

There would be large rustlings

I'd be hearing.

Birds among dry leaves
On the ground,

And the tread of a lizard
Would be a loud sound.

I would feel a friendliness,

I would be a part

Of the hiII’s quiet, the earth's
Beating heart.

The Last Run

CALVIN W. WALKER

SHALL never forget that last run of

the steamer from. Engine Four. Nor
will the memory of those three running
horses ever completely fade. Mechanized
equipment may make greater speed. It
may be far more efﬁcient, more depend-
able, more up—to-the—minute. It may, in
its shining brass and glowing coat, give
a needed assurance. But, for sheer
color, for wild beauty and trained en—
deavor, give me the horse of an old-time
steamer.

The ﬁre was well under way that warm
summer day. Great billowing clouds of
smoke, like enormous plumes, were doff—
ing the four-storied factory. Already
the engines were roaring from every
direction; were racing, wild with scream-
ing sirens, toward the mounting holo-
caust. And suddenly, at the far end of
the cobbled street, I saw that old steamer
from Engine Four. Even above the caco-
phonous bark of motors, the brittle
crackle of ﬂames and the hoarse shouts of
ﬁremen, I could hear the staccato beat of
the horses’ pounding hoofs. Three
abreast, their heads high, their manes
whipping in the wind, their feet lashing
out in broken unison, they came thun-
dering down the street.

Behind their wild running the steamer
belched forced smoke; spewed it, thick
in backward draft. And, leaning for-
ward, urging with free rein, the driver
talked to them, loudly, his voice cutting
the wind and the noise. Not until they
drew close did he gather in the reins,
slowing them, bringing the cumbersome
vehicle to a grinding stop.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Then, amid the
smoke and the cin—
ders and the bedlam
of sound, the driver
unhooked the wagon
tongue; drove the
horses forward,
calmly, several feet.
He left them there,
unhitched, their
reins idle over lath-
ering bodies. In all
that great confusion,
in all the excitement,
they stood serenely,
unperturbed, as doc—
ile by contrast as
their unbridled ap-
proach. And for
hours they remained
at their post—pa-
tient, fearless, un—
concerned. Then, to-
ward dusk, when the
last of the ﬂames
glowed feebly in a
gutted framework,
they backed into po-
sition and, respond-
ing eagerly, started
for home.

It was their last
run. Within a few
weeks the old steam—
er was taken away
and they were trans-
ferred to the less ar-

duous task of haul-

ing city wagons. Unquestioning, loyal,
they appeared to accept their less color—
ful role; to accept it, until, one bright
day, one of them was near the station
when an alarm “hit.” For a second he
appeared to listen, to raise his beautiful
dark head against the count. Then, "hear-
ing the engines, he bolted; raced, driving
pounding hoofs, in one ﬁnal, eager re-
sponse.

He was dead when they reached him.
The building, had he cared, could have
been easily avoided. There was, no rea—
son—unless, perhaps, in his noble mind,
he knew he could run no more.

Black Steeds Not Popular

Black steeds do not seem to have been
very popular, although history in England
gives some notable exceptions: “Black
Bess,” ridden for hundreds of miles by
Dick Turpin the highwayman; and of
course no English funeral procession
used to be complete without a pair of noble
black horses decorated with black plumes
attached to their headp‘ieces. A well—
known writer of the early days and a
keen student of horses stated that an all
black horse should be avoided as the
plague as they were bad tempered, mis-
chievous, and led to misfortune.

GEORGE E. DAVIS

 

Poor Man’s Cow

HE lowly goat, long considered by

many a more or less useless and ridic-
ulous creature, is now serving mankind
as a source of healthful and inexpensive
milk. According to Ed. Stout, Atlanta
Journal farm editor, goats cost less to
start with—they eat less feed and the
overhead is nothing compared to the
management of cows.

A doe goat, giving six quarts of milk
per day, can be fed for ten cents a day
provided the farmer raises his own feed,
and it has been proved you can feed ﬁve
goats as cheaply as one cow. They eat
corn, velvet beans, soy beans, oats and
peas. Fifty acres of land will easily
carry twenty-ﬁve milk goats.

The United States Department of
Agriculture reports that the butter fat
composition of goat’s milk averages 5.99
per cent, as compared to 3.9 per cent for
cow’s milk under similar conditions.

Goats are well on the way to solve the
shortage of milk among many of our
low-income groups. The poor man’s cow
and the goat industry is a coming thing
for this country.

Seventy-fourth Annual Report of the President
For the Year Ending December 31, 1941

I

The Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals

HE Massachusetts Society for the
TPrevention of Cruelty to Animals

enters in 1942 upon its seventy-
ﬁfth year of service in what very well
may be called a world-Wide movement
for the protection and welfare of all
sentient life—primarily of all animal
life where the capacity for suffering
exists and where such suffering may be
due to the unjust and cruel treatment of
defenseless and unprotected animals.
But of equal importance, and of even
greater importance, has been the work
this Society has done in awakening in
the hearts of the young in schools and
colleges the recognition of the claims
upon them of that vast world of animal
life for just and kindly treatment.

In connection with the other Society,
the American Humane Education So-
ciety, also founded by George T. Angell,
it has sought to show the inhumanity
of such age-long evils as race prejudice,
intolerance, a selﬁsh and narrow
nationalism, and those bitter hatreds
among men which have led and are still
leading to that sulpreme folly and cru-
elty we call war.

This past year the activities of the
Massachusetts Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals throughout
the Commonwealth will be seen in the
statistical reports of the work done at
and by our several agencies, shelters,
and at the Angell Memorial Animal
Hospitals in Boston and Springﬁeld.
It has also been necessary to spend
many thousands of dollars at the Hos-
pital-s, both here in Boston and in
Springﬁeld, to bring 'these two places
of help and healing to suffering animals
up to the point of highest efﬁciency and
service.

Greatly delayed in the completion of
some of these improvements by reason
of the inability to secure the building
and other material needed, due to the
defense plans of the government, prog-
ress is sti‘ll being made and it is hoped
by the middle of the year that our pres-
ent goals will be reached. Ultimately
we hope to have all our various wards
equipped with the ﬁnest type of glass
kennels which are the last word in such
hospital features.

The work of our prosecuting ofﬁcers
here in Boston and the work of our sev-
eral Shelters throughout the Common-
wealth is told in the reports that follow:

1. Question: Each summer my dog
has a skin condition that has been diag-
nosed as eczema. Raw sores appear,
usually along his back, and they seem
very irritated. What causes this condi-
tion? Is there any prevention, and how
can it be cured?

Answer: The condition you describe
arises every year in many hundreds Of
dogs. There are as many answers to its
cause, none of which have been proved
to be right in all cases. Many veterina-
rians believe eczema to be caused by diet,
while many believe it to be the result Of
contact with some material to which the
dog is sensitive. Perhaps both schools Of
thought are right. The best answer is
that we are not sure what causes moist
eczema in dogs.

It is reasonable to believe that it is a
sensitivity or allergy to some thing or
things. Whether these things (and it
may be anything) are eaten or touched
would make no difference in the result.
If an animal is sensitive or allergic to
any substance, and comes in contact with
that substance, a reaction takes place.
It may in some cases result in What we
call moist eczema.

As to preventing this condition, if we
knew what caused it we could avoid con—
tact with the causative agent and thereby
prevent it. However, there are SO many
things that act as allergens (causative
agents for an allergic reaction) that ﬁnd-
ing the particular one that causes eczema
in your dog is a big problem. If you
knew everything he ate and everything
he touched you would have a start. How—
ever, the Offender could be any one of
these hundreds of things, even pollen or
dust in the air, so you see the problem
is quite large.

In regard to its treatment: Your vet-
erinarian probably has his favorite mix-
ture that will give relief. There are
quite a few lotions and salves that give
a measure Of beneﬁt. There is no one
cure-all. Boric acid powder, sulfathiazole
powder, some antiseptic powders, various
skin lotions, Ointments and Oils, have
their uses. But, before you use anything,
you had better have your veterinarian
check the dog and make sure that it is
eczema and not some other skin condition.

2. Question: Is there any preparation
that will protect a dog from ticks?

Answer: There are preparations that
will give some measure of protection
from ticks. These materials are not to
be regarded as giving full protection,
however. Talk with your veterinarian
about this matter and he will advise you
what to do. Ticks are rather prevalent
this year, and careful examination Of
your animals is your best protection.
Look through their coats daily or Oftener,
especially if you are near WOOds.

“The Songster Sentry”
E L I N O R W E N D Y

ITH more and more coal being

mined in the all—out effort for de—
fense, few people realize that the canary,
the familiar feathered songster of our
homes, helps make it possible for man
to wrest coal from the earth.

For years canaries have been sentries
in the mines to warn men of the pres-
ence of carbon monoxide, the dread
“ﬁre damp” which used to take such a
toll of lives. When Sir Humphrey Davey
invented the miner’s safety lamp “ﬁre
damp” was no longer feared because of
the explosions it might cause. However,
it still took lives because it was poison-
ous, and the use of canaries in mines
helped remove the danger.

The canaries were brought into the
mines in cages. Wherever a crew of
miners exploring the subterranean gal—
leries suspected “ﬁre damp” a cage of
happily chirping birds would be brought
in with them. This usually occurred
where new shafts were to be opened.

If the canaries went about their chirp-
ing without any signs of discomfort it
was all right for the miners to go to
work. The air was pure. If the canaries
stopped singing, looked listless, then one
by one keeled over, that was the danger
signal—the dreaded “ﬁre damp” was
present. The miners left hastily taking
the [canaries with them. The birds soon
revived in the fresh air outside and the
poisonous fumes in the tunnels were re-
moved with giant blowers before mining
was commenced.

The reason canaries are useful to man
in this respect is because they are more
sensitive to poisonous gasses. “Fire
damp” has no odor of its own. Without
their feathered sentries on guard, help-
less miners would suddenly succumb to
its effects with-out even a chance to get
away. With the canaries to serve as a
warning the men are able to get away
before enough of the poison is absorbed
in their blood to render them uncon-
scious. And you can realize that mine
canaries get the very best of attention
from the miners whose lives they guard.
Without their warning many a man
would have perished underground.

The Hylas

Nixon Waterman

The winter lingers long and long
With fields snow-tilled and dreary;
I hunger for a wild bird’s Song
To glad a world grown weary.
Will June-time ever come again
With dew-drenched meads of clover
To cheer the doletul hearts of men?
Will winter ne’er be over?

I know the sun its cure will bring
For winter’s wounds so tragic;
Some splendid day a breath of spring
Will work its subtle magic:
And come there must the evening when
My tingling blood, wild-leaping,
Will tell me all is well again,—
l’ll hear the hylas peeping!

Judge Joseph A. Sheehan

Judge Joseph A. Sheehan of the Suf-
folk County, Massachusetts, Superior
Court died at his home in Boston in
February at the age of 68. For thirty-
six years he had been a director of the
Massachusetts S. P. C. \A., and for the
last twenty years had been also a direc-
tor of the American Humane Education
Society. Before he was elevated to the
bench he was quite active in the affairs
of both Societies, and served without
pay for several years as auditor of the
two corporations. His valuable assist-
ance and advice were greatly appreci-
ated.

Judge Sheehan, who was widely known
and highly esteemed in Boston and
throughout the state, was educated at
the Brimmer Grammar and English
High schools and the Boston University
School of Law. He became prominent
in the affairs of the Catholic Church,
holding oﬁi-ces in several Societies. In
1904 he was elected to the Boston School
Committee, and later to the Boston City
Council, but soon retired from politics.
He was appointed a Municipal justice
in 1913 and a judge of the Superior
Court in 1935. From 1924 he served
several years on the Boston Finance
Commission.

In 1914 Judge Sheehan married Mrs.
Catherine Lombard who survives him.
He also leaves a sister,
Miss Mary Sheehan, and
a stepson, Lawrence J.
Lombard. To these mem-
bers of the family our
sincerest sympathy is
extended.

1. Question: Recently my dog, an
Irish setter, has been playing in a vacant
lot. He comes in later loaded with burs.
These are very hard to remove and I
don’t like to cut them out. Is there any
way to remove these burs?

Answer: The easiest way to remove
burs, both for you and the dog, is to
soak them in mineral oil, working this
well into the hair and bur, then gently
comb out the bur with a stiff comb, pref-
erably a wire comb.

2. Question: I have a kitten, three
months old, and I wonder if you would
give me some advice as to his diet. He
doesn’t seem to care for milk and I
have been told it is not advisable to feed
very much ﬁsh and meat. What brands
of canned cat foods do you recommend?

Answer: Cats are carnivorous animals
and their natural food consists of prin-
cipally meat and ﬁsh. There is no reason
why your kitten cannot be fed meat and
ﬁsh. It is advisable also to give him
milk, if he can be trained to drink it,
along with some cooked cereals as his
preference may dictate. Young kittens
should receive cod liver oil, especially in
the winter, about a teaspoonful a day.

Young animals should be fed small
amounts of food three or four times a
day; avoid overfeeding.

Adequate tests and analyses on canned
cat foods are not available as yet, so we
don’t advise canned food.

3. Question: For the last three days
my kitten has refused to eat. It is six
months old and has never refused its
food before. It has vomited several
times. Could it have been poisoned?

Answer: It is doubtful if the cat has
been poisoned. The symptoms you de-
scribe are those of an infectious disease
of young cats, called panleucopenia. It
would be best for you to consult your
veterinarian who could advise. you as to
treating the kitten. This disease is
about 65 per cent fatal.

4. Question: Is it advisable to have
a puppy vaccinated against distemper?

Answer: A full series of distemper
inoculations are the best insurance one
can have to prevent the dog from con—
tracting distemper. There are several
methods by which these inoculations
are given. All of them are effective
after the dog is four months old. There
are none of them that can guarantee
100 per cent protection, but they all give
better than 90 per cent protection.

Found
Roberta Godwin

I was tired of the world, ﬁred of men,

Tired of the hunger and greed for gold;

Sick of the face of the fair-weather friend,

Bored with the things that are bought and
sold.

I was lonely too, in my heart deep down,

With people surrounded I still must feel

Alone in the midst of a lighted town,

Seeking for something alive and real.

No more would laughter and chatter yield

Even the ghost of a smile for me,

I wore my mood as a knight his shield

And looked toward something I could not
see.

Then I opened my door to the cold and fog,
Found on the doorstep, my friend, a dog.

F oundling Puppy

KADRA MAYSI

EVERAL weeks ago we were awak-

ened at dawn by the piteous crying
of a young puppy. On our lawn we found
a heavy carton with its top closed so as
to shelter but not cut off all air. In it
was a small nondescript white puppy on
a bed of rags—and a large bone.

The night before I had come home
shortly after midnight and the car
headlights had swept our small city gar-
den. No box was then on the lawn and
it was pouring rain. So I can establish
the time of the foundling’s arrival as
somewhere between 12:30 and 6 A. M. of
a bitter January night in a freezing rain.

We put our foundling close by the
kitchen stove and gave it warm mush of
fresh milk and hominy. It was plump
and clean and healthy and did not seem
especially hungry. All it asked was to
follow the cook or to be carried around
the house in the crook of my arm. Judg-
ing from its behavior it was accustomed
to love and petting. With it in my lap,
I spent most of the morning at the
telephone, selecting, from several possi-
bilities, the best home for it. To my
great sorrow, we cannot keep a dog; and
I knew that if I hugged the little fellow
much longer I couldn’t give it up.

My choice of new homes seemed to lie
between a hunting club in the country
and a friend who occupies a second ﬂoor
apartment. Before I could decide, I
heard the voice of the faithful old colored
man who comes several times a week to
do our outside work. He was addressing
the puppy in the tone of an unmistakable
dog-lover and the puppy was responding
joy-ously. Sam came up the back stairs
with a basket of kindling and remarked
to me: “S‘ho’ is a ﬁne dog. Sho’ wish I
had ’em.”

I did a bit of quick thinking. Sam
lived alone in a small house in a small

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

yard in the upper part
of the city. I knew he
was well to do and could
afford to buy milk for
the puppy and he as-
sure-d me he would do so.
So I canceled both hunt~
ing club and apartment
dweller and my found-
ling went away with Sam
in the basket of his bi-
cycle. My choice has been
justiﬁed; for the dog is
well and growing and
Sam’s eyes shine with
pride and pleasure when
he speaks of it.

But I keep thinking of
the person who aban-
doned it on a freezing
winter night—yet cared
enough to make it a bed
and furnish it with
a bone. That set-up
sounded almost like the
abandonment of a hu-
man baby. People who
are cruel enough to aban-
don animals do not usu-
ally trouble to give them
even temporary food and
shelter. I am afraid that
some child who loved
the puppy was ordered
by parents to get rid of

it. But—what child could have brought
it out between midnight and dawn on
the worst night of January, 1942?

The Negro and the War

If the Negro is an American citizen
and is summoned into war, or enlists,
what right has the Government to treat
him as an inferior and practically isolate
him from his fellow soldiers? Truly does
The Crisis, an ably edited magazine, say:

“The ﬁrst implication of segregation is
inferiority. N o matter what smooth,
‘practical’ explanations are made, the im-
plication remains. For there has never
been, thus far, separation with equality.
We believe this inescapable feeling of in-
feriority, and the shame and resentment
of Negro soldiers and civilians that their
government should force it upon them as
a national policy in a war against racial
bigotry and barbarity, are the underlying
causes of all the headaches the War De-
partment has had over Negro soldiers in
training this past year. We [believe it to
be the root of the extraordinary and un—
precedented apathy of Negro civilians
toward the war effort.

“The 1942 Negro resents and rebels
against 1842 regulations. These must be
rooted out, whether they reside in the
Mein Kampf of a Hitler or in a memo-
randum in the adjutant general’s ofﬁce of
the American Army.”

The Stupidity of Intolerance

FRIEND of the Society recently

mailed us a newspaper clipping
Which carried a story about the cruel
abuse of a Japanese monkey in a Chicago
zoo.

According to the newspaper, people
threw missiles at the animal because it
was of Japanese origin, and the monkey
in turn ﬁred the rocks back at its antag-
onists, with the result that the animal
had to be taken from public View and
placed somewhere else.

We can only pity the mentality of those
who would abuse an animal penned up in
a 2:3 cage, and hope that misguided pa-
triotism will not unleash cruelties upon
German shepherd dogs, many of which
are serving nobly as “seeing-eye dogs”
and as aids to the Red Cross.

The Doberman pinscher is also help-ing
with national defense by assisting troops
patrolling lonely places. The dachshund,
which is a delightful pet, has often been
subjected to much ridicule. We should
remember, though, that British Ambas-
sador to the United States, Lord Halifax,
has had one for years and has often been
photographed with it.

Animals are above war and race issues.
To abuse them because they are called
German shepherds, Japanese monkeys or
Italian bull—dogs is not only cruel but
stupid.

on pasture with the other horses on the
Rogers’ ranch. There were instructions
that he was to have the best of care, but
one day the fence was broken down. The
ranchman found that the horses had es—
caped. Eventually they were all rounded
up except one. Nowhere could Teddy be
found!

When Will Rogers, far away in the
east, learned of the disappearance, he
was heart—broken. He wired his nephew
to make an immediate and thorough
search for the pony. Neither time,
trouble, nor expense was to be spared.
Teddy must be found!

Months passed and at last Teddy was
discovered. In a cornﬁeld, pulling hard
at a plow, with an old Indian driving
him, they found the little pony that had
been the idol of thousands of boys; that
had worn the softest felt shoes on his
dainty feet and a gold-banded blanket
on his back; that had displayed human
intelligence in his acting before Ameri-
can audiences, and had played for the
King of England.

Will was delighted when he learned
that Teddy was safe and back on the
ranch again. He ordered that the pony
be given the very best of everything,
and all possible care taken of him. These
instructions were carried out, and Teddy
lived in contentment to an old, old age.

Where Horses Are Blessed

L. E. EUBANKS

VERY year, on April 23, which is the
feast of St. George, the inhabitants
of the quaint village of Turtmann, in the
Valais, Switzerland, bring their horses,
donkeys and mules to the entrance of
their parish church to have the animals
solemnly blessed by the priest. St.
George is the patron saint of domestic
beasts in that part of the country, and
peasants will gladly interrupt their work
in the ﬁelds to take their four-legged
helpers to the scene of blessing. Some
eighty animals were brought to last
year’s ceremonies.

Blessing the horses is also an important
rite in the canton of Ticino. In this in-
stance it is St. Anthony who is revered
as patron of horses, donkeys, and mules,
on January 17. After Holy Mass has
been celebrated in the church, the priest
will step outside and give his blessing to
the waiting animals. At Bellinzona, cap-
ital of the canton, some thirty or forty
horses were blessed last year; at Locarno
and in other communities the number
varied, according to the size of the 10-
cality. The animals are specially groomed
and adorned for the occasion. Entire
families witness the ceremonies and dogs
are very often brought along also to re-
ceive a blessing.

Our F ur-Bearing Animals
T. J. McINERNEY

PURE WHITE MINK RAISED ON RANCH IN MANITOBA

Societies to eliminate needless cru-

elty in the trapping and killing of
fur-bearing animals are at last beginning
to bear fruit. The commercial fur in-
dustry, it is encouraging to note, is co-
operating to a great extent in this hu-
mane education work.

The woman who purchases an expen—
sive fur coat, made from the pelts of
mink, fox, rabbit, Persian lamb or some
other little furred creature, doesn’t stop
to think that the little owners of those
pelts once roamed free in the wilds of
their native habitats. Nor does it occur
to her to inquire if the skin came from
an animal that has been raised on a
ranch and put to death in a humane
manner.

In their efforts to protect our fur-bear-
ing animals from being the victims of
commercialization, the Humane Societies
are getting the co—operation of govern—
mental conservation agencies. In this
country, the Division of Wildlife Re-
search of the Department of the Inte-
rior and, in Canada, the Department of
Mines and Natural Resources, Province
of Manitoba, are doing splendid work.

The principal contribution of these
governmental agencies is the rigid super-
vision they maintain over the commer-
cial fur industry. They are constantly
striving to perfect living conditions for
the animals and conducting experiments
in fur-animal nutrition, control of infec-
tious diseases, elimination of parasitic
infestation and breeding problems.

Notable progress in the system of feed-
ing the animals on ranches was made in
this country some years ago when the

Y EARS of diligent effort by Humane

ranch operators were required to use
feed pans that were washed and scalded
each day. Formerly, the feed was simply
thrown to the animals, to be eaten off
the ground, but the occurrence of para-
sitic infestation and disease caused the
abandonment of this method.

Of great concern to members of Hu—
mane Societies and other lovers of dumb
animals are the methods used to kill
these fur-bearing creatures of the wild.
Minks are usually placed in small, air-
tight boxes having small holes through
which a lethal gas is introduced, result—
ing in a painless death for the animal.
Where carbon monoxide is used, the
Division of Wildlife Research warns
breeders that care must be used to guard
against the hot fumes striking the animal
and singeing the fur.

The cruel, vicious and inhumane steel
trap, too often used to capture fur-bear-
ing animals, should be eliminated.

Despite the great progress that has
been made, there is still room for im—
provement. A more humane method of
killing rabbits, to replace the present
slaughtering system, must be devised. In
some places wild foxes are captured in
traps.

It is regrettable, of course, that these
little furred animals have to be put to
death in order that some be—furred hu-
man may make a favorable impression in
society. However, as long as economic
conditions make it necessary, the alert-
ness of Humane Societies and others con-
cerned with the humane treatment of
animals, will go far to prevent undue
exploitation and needless cruelty in the
capturing and killing of the animals.

The Boy and the Gun

HE following story is sent us from

the San Diego Union. Who was most
responsible for that blind eye —— the
parents who gave the gun or the boy
who had it as a plaything?

“This is the story of Manfred Aident,
one of our classmates. I’m telling it in
hope that it may save you from having a
like experience.

“One evening Manfred’s mother left
him and Gene, his friend, building boat
models while she went to call on a neigh—
bor. Manfred soon gave up boat-building
and started to ﬁx his BB gun. He turned
the barrel to make the BB come out.
The BB came out all right, but landed
right behind his right eyeball. At ﬁrst
he didn’t know what happened because
it happened so quickly. Then he felt a
sharp pain. He let out a yelp and ran
out of the door with Gene on his heels.

“When he got to the neighbor’s he
ﬂung open the door and made a dash for
his mother. The neighbors put something
cold on it. Manfred was very dizzy. They
rushed him to the Mercy hospital where
he slept for about an hour. At about 9
o’clock, Manfred had three X-rays taken
of his eye, then he was taken back to
his ward.

“Manfred stayed in the hospital under
the doctor’s care for eight days. They
hoped they would be able to save his eye,
but the hope was vain; the sight of the
eye was gone.”

Animals in the Dark

L. E. EUBANKS

ENERALLY speaking, animals see
better in darkness than persons do.
But they see better in daytime too; the
difference between the cat’s sight and
ours, for instance, at night is not as great
as is generally supposed, and some actions
of animals in the dark, commonly as-
cribed to superior sight, are governed
more by other senses.

Our cat likes to chase pebbles when I
throw them, but when I do this after
dark she doesn’t seem to see any better
than I do. Standing close to my hand
when the stone leaves it, she starts, but
is immediately confused.

Man has not explained exactly how
migrating birds ﬁnd their way. A cer-
tain type of plover nests in Canada. At
the end of the summer these birds ﬂy
2,500 miles over the ocean to South Amer-
ica, with no landmarks to guide them. Is
it possible they can sense the north-south
magnetic lines of force? Experiments so

far have proved nothing.

How is it that ﬁsh avoid colliding with
objects in the dark? Along each side of
the body are microscopic organs affected
by the pressure of the water. If the ﬁsh
is swimming toward a rock, the water
presses against its body and it turns
aside.

But that cannot explain the ability of
bats to ﬂy through intense darkness with-
out hitting anything. It is suggested by
a professor that the skin on a bat’s face
is probably much more sensitive than our
own, thus enabling the bat to feel the
pressure of air when ﬂying toward a
solid object that might injure it.

Trophy Room
Rena Stotenburgh Travais

I am a mighty hunter and my trophy room
is filled

With birds and beasts that l have shot,
though none of them were killed;

I hunted where the squirrels played
in kindly orchard shade

And where the deer came down to drink,
along a forest glade.

I made the gull and raven mine, the heron
and the rook;

I wish that everyone could see the pictures
that I took.

A Trustful Moose Calf

W. J. BANKS

HE moose, largest and mightiest of

the deer people, is perhaps the friend-
liest and most easily tamed by human
kindness. This few-days—old calf, or-
phaned near Shelburne, N. S., is only
slightly camera shy. He poses prettily
enough with the encouragement of a
gentle touch from the hand of the friend
he has learned to trust.

In spite of his friendliness the moose
is almost never seen in captivity, for he
will die on a diet of grass, hay and other
foods upon which most deer can main-
tain health. A browsing animal, the
moose needs the tender leaves, twigs and
bark of his native woodland, plus the
succulent shoots that grow beneath the
surface of the northern lake or lily pond.
For this is the most aquatic of deer,
plunging like a waterfowl for his favorite
plants and often taking to the water,
with only his grotesque nose above the
surface, at the approach of danger.

The devotion of mother moose to her
offspring, usually twins, is famous in the
northland. Not long ago a moose family
was forced to swim for it when a ﬁre
burned itself out on the shores of their
home lake. One calf rested her forelegs
on the mother’s rump and made the
crossing; but baby brother, falling be-
hind, lost his way in the smoke and dark-
ness. Utterly exhausted when rescued,
he lay, too terriﬁed to move, in the bottom
of the motor boat.

The ranger enclosed him in a corral
near his cabin far up the chain of lakes,
and soon the young calf was as tame as
a pet dog. But mother moose had not
forgotten the lost one. One stormy night
the ranger heard something thud against
the boards of the corral. In the morning,
he found planks kicked down from the
outside. Large moose tracks, followed on
the return journey to the edge of the
woods by those of a calf, and there joined
by a second calf, told the story. The
moose family was united and happy
again!

The Sea Gulls and the Little Boy
KATHERINE SIMONS

I know a little boy who loves
To watch the sea galls, sun or rain.
He says : “They wave their wings at me
“When they come flying over! See?
“So I wave back again.”

He sits upon the old sea wall
And waves his hand at galls in ﬂight.
And, when they slant above his head,
They dip their wings—just as he said.
The little boy is right!

A Letter Worth Printing

The following, from Patty and Dick, shows so much
love for their pet and is so cleverly written that we are
glad to reproduce it:

Dear Sir,

“Snippy,” our ﬁve-months-old tiger cat, was run over
by an automobile and we were so happy when Dr.
Siegle at the Springﬁeld S. ,P. C. A. Hospital told us he
could put his hurt leg in a sling and in a few days Snippy
would be able to get around again. When the day came
to drive the twenty miles to have the Dr. take off the
sling we got up early and found that Snippy had some—
how got his own sling off—and hidden it! We have
searched the house and even raked in ﬂower beds just
to see if he had buried it—but Snippy took no chances
of its being found and possibly put on again.

Dad offered a prize to the one who could ﬁnd Snippy’s
hiding place and that made us look harder than ever,
but Snippy is the only one who knows where the sling is,
and he won’t tell.

Well anyway he saved us precious gas for that last
trip to the hospital.

Your friends,
Patty and Dick Benton

Bird Serves as Auto Mascot

GLEN PERRINS

T OMMY Carter, of Ogden, Utah, is perfectly willing
to forego a metal radiator cap on his private auto,
now that he has found this real live American sparrow
hawk for a substitute. The hawk took refuge at the
Carter home in Ogden when a pair of robins ganged up
on him with dive-bombing tactics. Usually the aggres-
sor, the hawk got the worst of the miniature aerial dog-
ﬁght and sought refuge at the feet of the boy. Tamed
by the viciousness of the robins’ attack, the hawk is
thoroughly satisﬁed to be a pet for Tommy.

He perches on Tommy’s outstretched ﬁngers, hops
onto his shoulders and generally performs as a tame
bird would. “The hawk has the most fun when I take
him for a ride on, my auto,” boasts Tommy, “and he
clings on for dear life when I go fast.”

The chipmunk spends most of the autumn in storing
away food to last him through the winter. First of all,
he digs a long, winding tunnel in the earth, with several
short branches, which he uses as storerooms. Into these
he carries nuts of all kinds: wheat, buckwheat, grass
seed, and any other food that will keep. He carries
these things a few at a time in two pouches—one in each
cheek. When the weather becomes cold, in November,
the chipmunk retires to his well-stocked burrow and
sleeps away a large part of the winter.

The “American Camel”
A L D E N M A N N

HEN the Spanish conquistadores
invade-d what is now Peru and
heard of a fantastic empire somewhere
in the purple haze to the east, they set
out toward that mysterious, lofty range
we now call the mighty Andes. Up and
ever up they toiled through barren
regions where few signs of life or
vegetation existed—an unbelievable land
of granite peaks and bottomless canyons.
Atop these mountains some two and
one-half miles above the sea the con—
quistadores came to the cold wind-swept
empire of the Inca ruler, Atahualpa, and
history records the conquest of this rich
domain. But little has been said of the
small, shaggy beast of burden found in
those regions then and still existing as
he chief burden bearer—the llama.

The llama is somewhat similar to the
camel, save that he is much smaller and
does not have a hump. About three feet
high at the shoulder, long-necked, long-
haired and varying in color from white
to black, he "is ﬁtted by nature for his
task in the rariﬁed atmosphere above the
clouds. He can work on a scant supply
of food and oxygen. High altitudes are
his habitat, and he thrives where other
beasts of burden would perish. No doubt
the llama helped to erect the marvelous
stone structures of the Inca empire.

The burden of the llama must not be
too heavy, for it is said that he knows
to a pound his capacity and that if he
is overloaded by even a small amount he
will lie down, refusing to go farther.
However, even with the small carrying
capacity of the llamas they are capable
of transporting tungsten, tin, vanadium,
copper, gold, silver and other valuable
strategic ores from the remote mines to
the few railroads found in the Andes.
Large trains of these little animals fol-
low the steep, rocky trails where it would
be impossible for other beasts of burden
to travel.

From the hair of the llama various
kinds of cloths are made for protection
against the biting wind of the high
paramo, and to the peon he is food and
clothing as well as burden bearer.

ZEBRA RANKS AMONG THE MOST BEAUTIFUL

 

Reunion of Veterans
WILLIAM MCNULTY

When a pilot ofﬁcer in the Royal Cana—
dian Air Force stepped out of a ﬁghter
plane on a farm near Lunenburg, N. S.,
he saw a horse looking steadily at him.
A forced landing had been necessary in a
pasture ﬁeld, but neither the plane nor
pilot was injured.

The pilot thought he recognized the
horse as one he owned about two years
ago, on a wheat farm near Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan, but which he had sold on
enlisting in the air force.

The airman shouted, “Major,” at the
horse. Whereupon, the equine raced
toward him, whinnying happily. The
horse rubbed his head against the pilot’s
uniform. The man and beast had a joy-
ful reunion for a half hour until the man
went to the nearest farmhouse to tele-
phone news of the mishap to his base.
The horse followed him right to the door,
and they were together until a rescue
plane arrived in about an hour.

The pilot learned that after he sold

Major, the horse was shipped from Saska-
toon to Halifax, N. S., in a carload of
western farm horses, and at Halifax, was
bought by the farmer close to Lunenburg
on whose land the plane came down.

The airman is now convinced the world
is not so big after all. Out on the prairies,
he had used Major for horseback riding
as well as general farm work, and they
had been the best of companions.

They were reunited after two years,
about 2,700 miles east of their old stamp-
ing ground. It was apparent the horse
had spotted his former master promptly
when the latter had emerged from the
plane.

Zebras are not put to work like horses,
because they are slow, lack pulling power,
and are not verydocile.

After the death of a friend (Sir
Thomas Noon Talfourd) Charles Dickens
wrote: “The chief delight of his life was
to give delight to others. His nature was
so exquisitely kind, that to be kind was
its highest happiness.”

More and more, we in this newer land
—all of us, men and animals,——are to
feel what those in other lands have been
so increasingly facing—the need not only
of giving up many a luxury, but also of
many things once deemed almost life’s
necessities. We must not forget, how—
ever, that we still have a vast deal for
which to be daily thankful.

When a leading army ofﬁcer declares
that every soldier in our armies should
learn to hate with bitter hatred his
country’s foes, and go forth to battle
with the passion to kill and maim them,
we easily see the passions war arouses.

Win this war we must, not only for
ourselves but for millions of our fellow
men the world over, whose “life, liberty
and happiness” are at stake.

But that spirit of hate and death which
ﬂames in the words quoted above by a
military official leaves no room in the
soldier’s heart for the words of Him who
died that men might live. But war—we
are learning new the godless thing for
which it stands, and we have made it
what it is.

Another rodeo is coming to Boston
soon. The cruelties that have character-
ized many of these exhibitions have been
denounced by all Humane Societies.

The one above referred to, we under-
stand, was formerly under the manage-
ment of Colonel Johnson. We can say this
for him—that he was very co—operative
with us and endeavored strictly to follow
the rules we gave him for the handling
of the animals—a violation of any one
of these rules, it being understood, would
be followed by immediate prosecution.

The public may be assured that the
present management will be given the
same rules, and any actual violation will
be subject to immediate arrest.

Religion in the Schools

HOSE of our readers who believe
that among life’s great values are the
things for which religion stands, and
who have regretted that our public
schools have so largely either ignored or
forbidden any reference to these values
in their courses of instruction, will be
glad to learn that more than ﬁfty per
cent of the children of two Back Bay
primary schools attended the ﬁrst classes
in religious instruction which opened
October 1st in the Boston Public Schools.
Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Chris-
tian Science faiths were represented.
Dismissal of pupils for one hour each
week for religious instruction in church
or synagogue schools was authorized last
June by the Boston School Committee.
Mention has already been made in our
magazine of the fact that the great edu-
cational institutions of our country have
long seemed to regard mere learning, and
particularly that of a scientiﬁc nature, to
be sufﬁcient to meet the needs of their
students.

“A Great Dynamic Faith”

On his return from his visit to Eng-
land in July Mr. John Foster Dulles,
Chairman of the Federal Council’s Com-
mission to Study the Bases of a Just and
Durable Peace, said:

“A noticeable deﬁciency, both in Eng-
land and here, is the lack of a great
dynamic faith. Victory is too much
looked upon merely as something that
will bring relief from peril. We do not
look to it as something that will also
bring the opportunity to achieve a great
mission in the world. It is only out of
such a faith that men develop their

greatest power.”

—FEDERAL COUNCIL
OF CHURCHES BULLETIN

Dean Inge Says

HAT widely-known Dean Inge, for-

merly Dean of St. Paul’s, London,
scholar, thinker, religious leader, more
than once in the various volumes that
have come from his pen, and in his
addresses, has referred to the animal
world and our relation to it. He has
even stated that the movement in modern
times, recognizing their rights, is one of
the marked steps forward in man’s
civilization.

He says, for example, “Personally I
have never killed anything larger than a
wasp, and that was in self-defense. It
is not necessary or possible to draw hard
and fast lines; what is necessary is that
we should recognize that the animals
have as good a right on earth as we have;
that ‘iour Heavenly Father feedeth them’
and wishes them to have such happiness
as they are capable of, and that they are,
in fact and not in metaphor, our own
kith and kin.”

He also says, “We may thank God that
the prediction of Jeremy Bentham has
been oﬂ‘lcially, though not wholly, ful—
ﬁlled: ‘The time will come when human—
ity will extend its mantle over every—
thing which breathes. We have begun
by attending to the condition of slaves;
we shall ﬁnish by softening that of all
the animals which assist our labors and
supply our wants.’ Those who have seen
the beautiful and absolutely unselﬁsh
affection which many animals, when they
are decently treated, show to their mas-
ters, must feel the same kind of shame
and bewilderment at the callous brutal-
ity often shown to them, that we feel
when we read of the treatment of slaves
in ancient Rome.

“It is war that wastes a nation’s
wealth, kills its ﬂower, narrows its sym-
pathies, condemns it to be governed by

Springﬁeld Auxiliary

Dr. Rowley and Mr. Hansen Address the
Members at Annual Meeting

HEARTY appreciation of the practi-
cal support given the Massachusetts
S. P. C. A. by the women of the Spring-
ﬁeld Auxiliary was voiced by President
Francis H. Rowley at their ninth annual
meeting held at Longmeadow Country
Club, May 14. Dr. Rowley credited the
Auxiliary with making it possible to ac-
quire much needed hospital supplies, in
addition to the installation of two wash-
ing machines, surgical dressing cabinets,
and contributions towards the recent
purchase of a lot of land to the east of
the Hospital building on Bliss Street. In
introducing Executive Vice—President
Hansen, Dr. Rowley said that a diligent
search of the entire country had con-
vinced him that there was no one better
ﬁtted to carry on the humane program
of the Massachusetts S. P. C. A. than is
Mr. Hansen. He has enjoyed wide experi-
ence in social welfare work and along
humane educational lines.

Mr. Hansen referred to the future of
humane education, so vital to the pro-
gram of character building, and said that
much as it is needed now it will be vastly
more needed after the war. He also de-
scribed the important part that women
have played in the humane cause, men-
tioning numerous prominent names in
the history of anti-cruelty endeavor, and
concluded with the statement that this
work would not have made the progress
it has without the support of the women.
He congratulated the Springﬁeld Auxil—
iary upon its unusually effective activi—
ties.

Mrs. Carlton H. Garinger, who has so
successfully headed the Auxiliary during
the past year, presided, and announced
that as there will be no “June Day” held
in 1942, this meeting would close the
activities of the year.

Mrs. Garinger was re-elected president
and other ofﬁcers chosen for the 1942-43
season were as follows: ﬁrst Vice-presi-
dent, Mrs. Walter J. DuBon; second vice-
president, Mrs. Robert R. Miller; record-
ing secretary, Mrs. Lawrence Davis;
corresponding secretary, Mrs. Harold S.
Treworgy; treasurer, Mrs. Richard A.
Booth; directors, Mrs. Harold G. Duck-
worth, Mrs. Ida M. Young, Mrs. Char-
lena B. Kibbe, Mrs. Stuart M. Robson,
Mrs. Harold S. Treworgy and Mrs. M. F.
Peterson. Mrs. Dwight W. Ellis is an
honorary director of the Auxiliary.

Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jer-
sey, New York and Pennsylvania have
laws against the cropping of dogs’ ears.
There is one exception in all these states,
namely, if the operation of cropping is
certiﬁed to by a registered veterinarian
as reasonable and necessary for protec-
tion of the dog’s health.

Winchester Auxiliary

Secretary Guy Richardson Speaks on
the Life of George T. Angell

SMALL but enthusiastic band of

members of the Winchester Auxil—
iary to the Massachusetts S. P. C. A.
held their annual meeting on May 14 at
the home of the president, Mrs. Richard
S. Taylor. Present as guests were Secre-
tary and Mrs. Guy Richardson. Mr.
Richardson gave a talk on the life and
work of George T. Angell, who founded
the Massachusetts S. P. C. A. in 1868 and
for whom the Angell Memorial Animal
Hospital is named. The speaker gave
reminiscences of his personal association
with the great humanitarian.

In her report for the year Mrs. Taylor
told of the many accomplishments of the
Auxiliary and stated that too much can-
not be said for the able services of Mr.
Arthur H. Bryer as manager of the
Shelter which the organization maintains
in Winchester. More than 300 cats and
100 dogs, besides numerous birds, rab-
bits, squirrels, goats, and even a monkey
were cared for last year. Members of
the Auxiliary hope to enlarge the Shelter
and add many improvements during the
coming season.

Ofﬁcers for the ensuing year are Mrs.
Richard S. Taylor, president; Mrs. John
Gilbert, vice-president; Mrs. John Ham-
ilton Clarke, treasurer; Mrs. Alfred‘Hil-
dreth, secretary; and Miss Evelyn
Parker, recording secretary.

Features at Annual Meeting Include
Talk by Vice-President Hansen

T the annual meeting of the North-
ampton Branch of the Massachu-
setts S. P. C. A., held on May 19, Mr.
Wayland L. Brown was elected president,
and Miss Elizabeth A. Foster, treasurer.
Miss Emily Hale, to whom great credit is
due for her work as president, presented
her annual report, showing that ﬁne prog-
ress was made during the past year. The
Branch now has more than 100 members.
Outstanding was the humane education
work carried on by Miss Hale herself who
visited numerous schools in the city and
surrounding towns, resulting in several
hundred children joining the Band of
Mercy. The Branch held a tag day in the
autumn and a beneﬁt bridge in the
spring. The Shelter, ably managed by
Miss Howes, took in 622 animals during
the year.

Eric H. Hansen, Executive Vice-
President of the M. S. P. C. A., was the
guest of honor. He gave an inspiring
address, telling of his impressions of the
institution since he became an ofﬁcer in
January and of the work of the Angell
Animal Hospital, particularly of the
courses that have been given on the care
of animals during air raids. A high
light of the meeting was the presence of
a group of 25 members of the Band of
Mercy, representing the different schools
that Miss Hale had organized. One or
. , two representatives
of each Band told of
the activities car—
ried on to promote
kindness. Two de—
lightful children, a
boy and a girl, sang
their class theme
song with such
gusto as to win the
hearts of all present.

Haven’t you often
wondered how a
baby chick, or a duck—
ling, managed to lie
Within so small a
shell? When the bird
ﬁrst punctures the
Shell’s inner mem-
brane and starts to
breathe the air of
the egg’s large-end
air sack, his body in—
ﬂates, actually grows
larger. Then, when
more air is inhaled
through the pipped
shell, he gains both
strength and size;
bursts his bonds and
emerges much big-
ger than seems pos—
sible as compared
with the egg.

 

 




 

Another Friend
MARY AGNES COLVILLE

JUST as music was inseparable from

the life of Ethelbert Nevin, the
musical composer, so was a spontaneous
feeling for animals. It seems natural,
too, that one who delighted in the so-
ciety of children, and who set “Little
Boy Blue” and other childhood verses
to music, should also love those other
appealing small folk of the animal and
bird realm.

The creator of “The Rosary,” “Nar-
cissus,” and other favorites of the home
and concert stage, came of a family that
was devoted to pets. If the Nevins were
going out of town to a wedding or some
other function, they would never con-
sent to leave until they had made ade-
quate arrangements for the comfort of
their dogs and other pets. Some respon-
sible servant or relative was delegated
to the task of seeing that the animals
were well cared for. Otherwise the fam-
ily would not have enjoyed the holiday,
due to anxiety over their pets.

In Ethelbert Nevin’s life were a long
succession of pets of various types and
names.

Shortly after the composer’s honey-
moon, he and his young bride had a be-
loved puppy whom they called “Schopen-
hauer.” Whenever they felt temporarily
blue, lonely or perplexed over some prob—
lem, they used to call in the dog to
comfort them. Affection was lavished
plentifully by the young people on this
adopted member of the household.

Once, when in Algiers, Nevin was
more captivated by watching the antics
of what he termed “a dear, little baby
camel” eating grass under a tree than
by any of his other experiences in a
strange land. Horses, birds, ducks, he
loved—even small pigs were among his
special acquaintances.

While sojourning for a lengthy period
in Italy, Nevin acquired several pets for
his household. The composer wrote to
friends in America how delighted he was
that he could purchase a donkey as a
personal pet for his little son, Paul. At
this same period, the composer also had
a dog, “Piccini,” of whom he was justly
fond.

The last time that Nevin sailed away
from Europe to this country with his
family, he was accompanied by two well
cared for canary birds and a cherished
greyhound. He would not think of leav-
ing these precious companions behind
in another country, no matter if he were
inconvenienced somewhat himself.

No doubt, this warm feeling for ani-
mals and birds was natural to one of
whom it has been said that he never
made an enemy consciously, or uttered an
unkind word of anyone. For, after all, is
not kindness to people closely knitted to
kindness to animals in a truly humane
personality?

English Soldiers and Dogs

N English woman, a great friend of
animals, has just sent us a letter
she received from the manager of the
hospital for animals in Cairo, Egypt,
which she gave to the People’s Dispens-
ary for sick animals of the poor of Lon—
don, in September, 1931. Judging from the
description, the garden surrounding the
hospital must be very lovely. Fruit trees,
grapevines and many ﬂowers are cared
for by Mr. J. W. Bloom, manager of the
hospital, who has not had a day off since
1933. A woman who had her dog in the
hospital expressed her feelings about the
institution by stating, “It is like a piece
of England.”

The majority of the hospital patients
are soldiers’ dogs. One patient was a
German patrol dog which was brought
in suffering from a badly-sprained leg.
The story about ﬁnding the dog is very
interesting:

“The owner, a soldier, said he was
lying badly wounded from shrapnel in a
hollow in the desert after an encounter
with the enemy, when the dog came to
him wagging its tail and licked his face
and hands. The dog apparently in the
confusion of the battle had got lost, and
so the soldier made friends with it and
they were both later conveyed to the
hospital. The hospital authorities kept
and fed the dog, and allowed the soldier
to keep it when he was discharged from
the hospital. It is a beautiful German
sheep dog, and so now both are staunch
companions.

“Another patient, an ordinary non-
descript dog, which was suffering with
fever, had saved its soldier-owner by
waking him up on hearing the approach
of a German patrol and thereby saving
his life.

“Many such stories are told about the
patients by the British Tommy whose
love of animals is so well known to all.”

London Letter

We are in receipt of a letter from Sir
Robert Gower, Chairman of the Royal
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, London, England, in which he
expresses the British Society’s apprecia-
tion of our recent notice concerning the
need for aid to Russian horses.

In closing his letter, Sir Robert says,
“I do feel that this is just one more
instance of the ever-willing co-operation
and help we receive from you, which
make it a pleasure to work together for
the animal cause.”

Rodeo Cancelled

We have been informed that Governor
Arthur B. Langlie, Olympia, Washington,
has ordered the 1942 rodeo in Ellensburg,
Washington, cancelled. This particular
rodeo has been a sore spot with humane
people on the West Coast, and we join
with them in expressing appreciation of
the cancellation.

FRIEND O'F ANIMALS, Mildred Mastin
Pace.

Here is the story of Henry Bergh,
founder of the ﬁrst society for the preven-
tion of cruelty to animals in the United
States, told in a fascinating way. Like many
other books, written for youthful readers,
this one has a strong appeal to adults,
also, especially if they are interested at
all in the protection of animals. The author,
who had already Written the story of Paul
Revere and that of Clara Barton, spent
much time at the ofﬁces of the American
S. P. C. A., in New York City, where she
got her material directly from original
sources so there can be no question as to
its authenticity.

As President Webb says in the Preface:
“ ‘Friend of Animals’ is more than the
story of a man. It is, in addition, the
story of the founding of two great move-
ments ———animal and child welfare. Nowa—
days we ﬁnd it difﬁcult to believe that or-
ganizations for the protection of children
and animals have not always existed.”
One of the ﬁne things about this volume
is the effective way in which the author
shows how the whole movement for child
welfare grew out of the movement to pro-
tect animals. The story of Mary Ellen is a
ﬁtting climax.

Thrilling tales of Bergh’s daring inter-
ference with the abuses of street-car horses,
dog-ﬁghts, and even P. T. Barnum’s famous
museum, and many other cruelties to an—
imals, are dramatically told. Many draw-
ings by Paul Brown illustrate the text.

TWENTY LITTLE FISHELS, Ida M. Mel-
len.

The famous author of several books re-
lating to the cat is also recognized as a
leading authority on ﬁshes. From her
long experience and her study of the latter
subject she presents another fascinating
book for young readers from the ages of
seven and upwards. The very names of
the little creatures of which she writes are
intriguing. There are the Sea Horses,
Mouseﬁsh, and Baby Eels in the big aquar-
ium; Catﬁshes and Mud Minnows in the
pond; Archer Fish and Guppies at Mr.
Fishfan’s House, and Sticklebacks and
Sea Robins at the seashore, and others
equally interesting.

Beautiful illustrations from cover to
cover in brilliant colors are the work of
Else Blostelmann.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

A Puppy’s World
Roberta Godwin

My puppy knows nothing of War,
Of loading or firing a gun;

He's much more concerned in finding
A warm dry spot in the sun.

His puppy mind can’t comprehend
The battles on sea and land,

The best he can do is cock his ear
And happily lick my hand.

The fields to him are wide and tree

He romps where green grass grows;

Oh God, please give us strength to keep
The world a puppy knows.

A Merry Visitor
WILLIS MEHANNA

HE ruby-throated hummingbird is

Iowa’s smallest feathered immigrant.
He comes in May when ﬂowers begin to
be in evidence and stays till well into
September. This bird is so active and
swift of wing that other birds do not
attempt to molest him. They shun him
as we do hornets. On account of his
sharp, strong bill, courage and swiftness,
he whips many big birds. The food of
these birds consists of nectar and tiny
insects taken from such ﬂowers as
trumpet creeper, columbine, tiger lily,
nasturtium and other tubular kinds such
as we have in our yards and on our
porches. While the male rests and plays,
the female builds the nest and rears the
family. The nest is small and cup-like,
lined with plant down, ﬁne moss and bark
scales. The nest is usually placed saddle-
like over a bran-ch or in a fork. Two
white eggs, about the size of small beans
are laid and hat-ch in two weeks. In
color the bill, feet and legs of both birds
are black. In the male, top of head, sides
and back of neck, back, rump and mid-
dle tail feathers brassy green; chin
and throat ruby red; sides light green;
wings purplish brown above. The female
is duller in color and does not have the
brilliant ruby throat. While not seem—
ingly fond of humans it does not appear
to fear them and is more or less unaware
of their existence.

Back to the Horse
CHARLOTTE 0. WEST, M.D.

WHAT a comeback the horse has
made, and how fortunate for us that
the population of this useful animal is
estimated at from eleven to thirteen
millions!

Our machine-minded people will be
forced to adjust themselves to many—
what were quite recently considered—an-
tiquated methods of travel, but the horse
is a most dependable servant and, treated
with the consideration due him, will get
us there.

There have been many cries of a horse-
less age. When Fulton’s steamboat moved
upstream against the Hudson’s current;
when the ﬁrst steam locomotive raced
and out-distanced the horse between
Baltimore and Ellicott’s Mills in 1830,
and again when the ﬁrst automobile was
demonstrated, the doom of the horse was
predicted.

However, all lovers of this noble animal
must have rejoiced that the days of the
pack—horse and mail ponies are ended. In
recent years even the cowpuncher lost his
avocation in favor of the more convenient
machine. But the usefulness of this
method of guarding the range has been
put in practice for governmental pur-
poses, and the experienced “cow” man
and his specially trained horse is again
doing what he loved best—riding the
range with his favorite companion.

Many horses that are discarded as too
old and useless for any purpose, horses
that have been overworked for years and
are apparently completely worn out, re-
gain a modicum of health and strength
under care and good treatment. I speak
of this because there are hundreds of
people who require some kind of horse
to do their lighter chores.

On the authority of the Horse and
Mule Association of America, it is stated
that any good farmer can operate his
farm well with one work-horse for every
twenty-ﬁve acres of soil. This requires
a pretty good horse. On a small estate
of my knowledge, ﬁve to seven acres of
which are tilled, the rest kept in beauti-
ful condition, one horse does the work.
When bought at a horse auction, he
brings around twenty-ﬁve dollars, and is
a sorry looking animal to a casual on-
looker, but the practiced eye of the
farmer sees his good points, and after a
few weeks of care and kindness, he is a
new animal. If he has a good disposition
he follows the farmer around like a dog.
He remembers the days of his youth, at
times, and rolls around on the grass in
sheer abandon.

Some years ago the lure of the saddle
swept the country like wild ﬁre. Every-
body who could—rode. A corresponding
interest and improvement in the quality
of horses and horsemanship has resulted.
The love and intelligent use of good

THE CITY OF NEWTON RE-OPENS A WATERING STATION FOR ,HORSES

With the advent of hot weather and the increase in the use of horses both for
pleasure and commercial purposes eﬁorts are being made to restore drinking places
for the animals. Further arrangements are also under way for furnishing free
drinking water at many gasoline stations. The Massachusetts Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals is sponsoring this aid for horses. The above fountain
is located at Newton Centre. In the group are (left to right) Dr. Francis H. Rowley,
president, Mayor Paul M. Goddard, and Eric H. Hansen, executive vice-president.

 

horses is our heritage.

The American saddle horse is a re-
markable breed. Docile, courageous,
proud and good-tempered, if treated
gently, but he instantly resents ill treat—
ment with whip or spur.

The American thoroughbred stands
the equal of his brothers in any land. He
is the swiftest of all equines, the gamest
and most faithful of his race; his breed
has been used to build almost every other
breed of light horse. His fame will go
down through the ages.

Will Rogers9 Best-Loved Horse

LOIS SNELLING

N her biography of her husband,

“Uncle Clem’s Boy,” Mrs. Will Rogers
writes often of horses. No true biog-
rapher could do otherwise, since horses
played such an important part in the
life of the cowboy-humorist. From the
days of his childhood on his father’s
Oklahoma ranch to the time of his tragic
death in Alaska, one of his interests and
deepest devotions was horses.

But of all the ponies that galloped and
raced through his active life, the one
that Will Rogers loved best was “Teddy.”
And Teddy well deserved his master’s

aﬁection, for it was he that co—acted
with Will in his early vaudeville days
and launched him on a successful stage
career.

Teddy had a heroic namesake to live
up to, for Will named him for President
Theodore Roosevelt. He was reared on
an Oklahoma ranch, and it was neces-
sary for Will to economize for some
time before he was able to save the one
hundred dollars that was Teddy’s pur-
chase price. He was a beautiful little
pony—dark bay, with black mane and
tail—and as bright as a new dollar. Will
would call out to him, “Right!” and he
would start instantly, and just as quickly
would he stop.

Will bought him a beautiful dark blue
blanket, banded with gold, and the name,
“Will Rogers,” in large gold letters
across it. The cowboy who assisted Will
in his act would ride the little horse,
dressed in his ﬁne blanket, from the
stable to the main thoroughfare. Then
he would dismount and Teddy, without
a halter of any kind, would follow him
down the crowded street and up to the
stage door.

When Will and Teddy ﬁnally sepa-
rated, the parting was a sad one. Teddy
was shipped back to Oklahoma and placed

The Locust

Leslie Clare Manchester

"I’ll take my fiddle and off I'll go

To fields of clover white as snow;

I'll breathe their fragrance rich as wine,
As sweet as the tang of a sun-kissed pine;
I’ll cling to a bloom where the dew has lain
And touch my strings to a glad refrain.

“I’ll sing to the stream in the lilied dell,

Its sheen in the sun, its deep dark well;

I’ll chant to the hawk in the upper sky;

To the hazy clouds that wander by;

I’ll draw my bow to the crickets’ cheep
And the call of the bull-frog hoarse and deep.

“I'll shrill in the light of the high white noon
With all my latent chords in tune;

l’ll travel the lane where the sumacs be,
The red of their berries good to see;

l'll soar with the eagle, crest and sink

To the meadow notes of a bob-o’-link.

”Then up and away with the breeze my sail
To islands of clover blooming pale;

Oh, on and on with a gypsy lay

Across the azure miles of day

Till the journey ends and my fiddle rings
With paeans to blossoms, waves and wings."

The Buffalo in Agriculture

G. HOWARD LAW

N the far East, where the War is now
raging, the buffalo enters into the
agricultural scene in marked degree.

As a beast of burden it is in common
use in the Philippines. Here, on the ex-
tensive ramie plantations, the buffalo
hauls the ﬁbre from ﬁeld to plant. He is
slow, but sure and cheap, and will draw
a lumbering wooden cart and heavy load
along rough tracks that would beat horse
or mule and bog a tractor. From ramie
ﬁbre an artiﬁcial silk is produced which
commands a wide market.

Incidentally, apart from the employ-
ment of this old-world mode of trans-
portation, there are a couple of other
facts of more than passing interest con-
cerning the Philippines. The ﬁrst is that
the archipelago, which derives its name
from King Philip I of Spain, consists of
no fewer than 7,000 islands; the other,
that off the island of Mindanao the ocean
bed reaches its greatest known depth of
35,400 feet, at the point known as Min-
danao Deep.

Another locality in the East where the
buffalo still holds its place is in the Neth-
erlands East Indies. On the immensely
fertile estates of Java, home of rubber,
coffee, spices, and the cinchona bark from
which quinine is derived, buffalo are ex-
tensively employed, adding to the wealth
of one of the world’s richest agricultural
territories, a land of volcanoes whose
truncated cones pierce with symmetric
beauty the ﬂawlessness of a tropic sky.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

The Buffalo Then and Now

THERON G. CADY

 

BUFFALO IN NATIONAL PARK

ARLY in the sixteenth century
E when Cortez came to Mexico he

visited the zoo of Montezuma, the
Aztec emperor, and there saw an animal
which he described as “a rare Mexican
bull with a hump like a camel’s and hair
like a lion’s.” This was the bison, or
buffalo. It is estimated that in those
days there were approximately ﬁfty
million of these “rare Mexican bulls”
roaming the plains of North America.

The male bison achieves a weight of
2,000 pounds or more; the female weighs
about half as much. Both sexes are
equipped with horns, which are never
shed. The young beast’s horns are
straight, assuming a curvature with ad-
vancing years. The horns are used by
the bulls in ﬁghting among themselves
for leadership in the herd, and in goring
their enemies.

Though the bison’s black or brown
hair is long, a woolly down at the base
gives it a shabby, matted appearance.
The immense head, familiar to every
American from its likeness on buffalo
nickels, is adorned with a huge, shaggy
beard.

Before the arrival of the white man,
the bison was a leading source of food,
weapons, clothing, and even shelter for
the Indians, many of whom wore buffalo
robes and lived in tepees made of buffalo
skins. The presence of this free food
supply greatly facilitated the white
man’s advance across the continent. As
civilization pressed westward, the great
herds began to disappear from their
grazing grounds. By the early part of
the nineteenth century those east of the
Mississippi had been wiped out as a re-
sult of the spread of agriculture and the
heavy demand for buffalo skins. The
completion of the Union Paciﬁc Railroad
divided the western herd into a northern
and southern half. The southern herd

Page 97

   

H,“

NEAR WAINWRIGHT, ALBERTA

was totally exterminated, and by 1895
only eight hundred of the northern herd
remained.

In their wild days, bison were migra-
tory in the sense that in winter they
would move three or four hundred miles
south in search of better grazing and
would return north in the spring. Usu-
ally the herd moved in single ﬁle, follow-
ing a leader. In these movements the
herds often fused into an army of mil-
lions. The buffalo trails thus formed in—
variably pursued the shortest and easi-
est route, so that engineers frequently
used them as a guide in constructing the
early railroads.

A big buffalo, usually a heavy plod-
ding creature, when pursued can tire
out three sets of horses and run nearly
forty miles in a single day. Its huge
heart and lungs seem to provide it with
remarkable endurance.

In summer, when bison shed, they are
plagued by mosquitoes, ticks, and prickly
grasses. Consequently they are forever
scratching against trees and boulders
and wallowing in the mud. These habits
have had a marked effect on the topog-
raphy of the West. The buffalo wallow
became a deep, smooth saucer in the
earth, while countless rocks and boulders
were worn smooth by the scratching of
large herds. Trees in the buffalo’s path
were killed by having their bark worn
off, and the ﬁrst telegraph poles erected
were knocked down by the weight of the
itching beasts.

The muskrat constructs its own raft
on which it can ﬂoat or rest, secure from
many land enemies, but not from water
foes.

“There was an owl who lived in an oak;
The more he saw, the less he spoke;

The less he spoke, the more he heard;
Why can’t we all be like that wise old bird?"

Sure Signs of Spring
Harry Elmore Hurd

The owl of winter flies with weary wing,
The tide of time is turning toward the sun,
The snowy fields are melting toward the

spring,

The flooding streams flow onward to the sea,

The long-necked swan swings up the silver
east

Along the starway of the Galaxy.

Belief transcends the beauties touched and
seen,

The sugar maple swells with rising sap,

Then flaunts the fact in foliated green.

Man feels the seasonal rhythm in his blood,
The tender leaves of hope stir in his heart
Like growing blades within the sticky bud.

I Learn About Cats
T. J. MCINERNEY

LL my life I have had a keen interest

in pets of all kinds and have owned

a number of them. For some reason un-
known to me, I never had any affection
for cats and, therefore, never owned one.

Several months ago, a friend of mine
found it necessary to move to another
city and asked me if I would take care of
her cat. I accepted with some misgiv-
ings at the time, but I have never for one
moment regretted taking in that little
feline.

During the past few months I have
learned a lot about cats. I have read and
studied about them and observed our own
little “ward.” With the thought that
they might prove helpful to others who,
like myself, have never understood the
little peculiarities of our feline friends,
I am passing along these few discoveries
of mine:

When they are out of‘sorts, cats are in-
clined to retire within themselves and it
is hard to ﬁnd out how they feel. A dog
will come to you, perhaps whimper a bit,
snuggle up to you and in some other way
let you know that “all is not well.” The
cat goes off by itself and gives the im-
pression of being unfriendly—unless you
understand its ways.

On the other hand, a healthy cat is
eager for its meals, eating them with
relish, though not voraciously. It is
bright and playful, and keenly interested
in what is going on about it. The eyes
are clear, the inside of the ears a clean
pink, the nose is moist and cool. The
teeth are white and clean, the tongue
never furred and the breath not foul.

The coat of a healthy cat is soft and
glossy, and its possessor takes a great
interest in keeping it so. When a cat
neglects its appearance, you can be cer-
tain that it is ailing.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Canine Life Savers
SIGMUND SAMETH, M.A.

IF anybody needs further proof that the

dog is man’s best friend among the in-
articulate creatures on this earth, hark-
en to the saga of “Ace.” Hundreds of
dogs have achieved canine notoriety by
saving a single human life, but Ace, so
far as I have been able to discover, is the
only dog who makes a profession of it.

Until he was ﬁve years old, last spring,
Ace’s distinctions were meagre ones.
He was, it is true, a beautiful specimen
of Belgian shepherd dog, proud, erect,
wide of chest, with tense pointed ears,
piercing eyes that sized up a stranger im-
mediately as friend or enemy. Ace’s mas-
ter was Earl Johnson, famous Hollywood
dog trainer who has helped hundreds of
canine stars to get their ﬁrst screen tests.
Under Johnson’s guidance Ace had a few
small roles in the movies. Then, laSt
May, his big chance came.

The Los Angeles Life Saving Squad
had a problem on its hands. Careless
week-end bathers at the municipal
beaches were going out beyond the life
lines, getting caught in the undertow,
causing no end of trouble to the over-
worked life saving force. Even with
every lifeguard mustered into service,
the crowded Sunday afternoons found
some of these men performing thirty,
forty, in one instance forty-six rescues
daily. Some help was needed. The help
was Ace.

 

//

A YOUNG ARISTO‘CRAT

 

M ar. 1942

In two short months, trainer Johnson
taught the wise old dog how to tow a
balsa “torpedo” in his mouth. Swim—
ming to the distressed bather with the
“torpedo,” Ace gives him something to
hold on to. Often the respite is all that
is needed to permit the bather to get back
to shore under his own power. In the
meantime the lifeguard on duty is left
free to attend to more urgent rescues
which may be occurring at the same in—
stant. Ace caught on almost immediate—
ly. Who says you can’t teach an old dog
new tricks? Almost a hundred Los An-
geles bathers owe, if not their lives, at
lea-st being spared a sputteringly uncom—
fortable experience to Ace, the lifeguard
dog.

The “torpedo” which the dog tows is a
streamlined cylinder about two feet long
with a leather thong which the dog can
grip between his teeth while swimming.
It will support two adult bathers or four
children who cling to loops on its circum-
ference, yet it can be towed by the dog
easily. Ace seems to have enjoyed his
novel summer job for he hovered at the
water’s edge eagerly awaiting the call
from the lifeguard to “Go get him, Ace!”

Bull-ﬁghts Suspended

Our readers will be glad to know that
We have received word from our foreign
correspondent in Cali, Colombia, that
bull—ﬁghts have been deﬁnitely suspended
in that locality due to the ﬁne efforts of
the Society for the Protection of Animals
there. Mr. Escobar, the
general secretary, also
writes: There have been
notable improvements in
the methods employed in
slaughter-houses and the
personnel thereof have
now received humanita-
rian instructions from
the undersigned.

Cock-ﬁghts continue to
enjoy popularity here,
notwithstanding our hav-
ing obtained from the
municipality a substan-
tial increase of the fees
or taxes for these shows.

The Hospital for Ani-
mals in Cali has a staff
of ﬁve veterinarians and
a superintendent. The
extent of its work is
shown by the fact that
in a recent month 182
cases were entered. In
the same period the So-
ciety inspected 391 ani-
mals, took 42 horses and
15 donkeys from work,
and made 19 prosecu-
tions with six convic-
tions.

Winchester Auxiliary

A series of very interesting meetings,
held by the Winchester Auxiliary to the
Massachusetts S. P. C. A., have attracted
much attention to anti-cruelty work in
that town. In February a public gather-
ing was held in the Library with an
address by Dr. E. F. Schroeder, chief
veterinarian of the Angel] Animal HOS-
pital, and a demonstration of an efﬁcient
ﬁrst-aid kit assembled by Arthur Bryer
who is in charge of the Winchester Ani-
mal Shelter at 432 Washington Street.
Plans are under way to enlarge this
Shelter where, in January, 22 animals
were cared for. A successful Fair was
held by the Auxiliary last fall.

First Aid to Animals in War

EVERAL courses in ﬁrst aid to ani-

mals wounded in air’ raids have been
Offered by the staff veterinarians at the
Angell Animal Hospital on Longwood
Avenue, Boston. One of these, for a
select number of qualiﬁed persons, mostly
owners of dogs, has been given in three
lessons by Dr. E. F. Schroeder, chief
veterinarian. The Editor of Our Dumb
Animals, always an ardent lover Of ani-
mals but never initiated into even the
rudiments of veterinary care, was privi—
leged to attend this course, which has
been repeated several times tO meet the
demand for this instruction.

First, the course is given in the very
atmosphere of the Hospital, as the class
was held in one of the large wards,
known as the horse Operating room.
Here not more than a dozen persons
listen to the lucid lecture of Dr. Schroe—
der and engage in actual tests of giving
medicine and applying bandages to an
animal. Of course in so short a period
the Doctor can attempt to give only the
rudiments of instruction for ﬁrst aid to
dogs and cats. He points out that not
all persons are suited for this work. He
discusses the proper approach to a
strange animal, wounded in air raids,
and gives in simple terms the technique
Of handling the animal and of admin-
istering sedatives in case of hysteria.
He then, by actual demonstration on a
dog, explains the methods Of applying
bandages for leg, head or body wounds.
The pupil learns the difference between
arterial and venous hemorrhages and
between simple and compound fractures.
The proper application for burns of ﬁrst,
second or third degree is given. Finally,
a kit of thirteen speciﬁc articles, neces—
sary for ﬁrst aid to animals, is listed,
together with general instructions on
how to act in emergencies. The student
comes away from the third session feel-
ing that, while there is much that he
does not know, he has at least a deﬁnite
idea of how to handle and treat a
wounded animal in case of air raids.

FOR TERMS, see back cover.

AGENTS, to take orders for Our Dumb Animals,
are wanted everywhere. Liberal commissions are
offered.

EDITORS of all periodicals who receive this pub-
lication this month are invited to reprint any of the
articles with or without credit.

MANUSCRIPTS relating to animals, particularly
prose articles of about 300 words, are solicited. We
do not wish to consider prose manuscripts longer
than 500 words nor verse in excess of twenty-four
lines. The shorter the better. All manuscripts should
be typewritten and an addressed envelope with full
return postage enclosed with each offering.

After the War

After the war is over, Humane Edu-
cation will face a great responsibility.
The people of nearly all lands will have
become hardened and rather insensible
to pain and suffering. Children, react-
ing to the parents’ attitude, will forget
many of the lessons in kindness preached
to them in earlier years.

To meet this challenge, our American
Humane Education Society is now en-
gaged in an extensive survey to provide
the right type of program and workers.
New approaches will have to be found
and greater co-operation obtained from
the schools. The task of reconditioning
our youth—yes, and our adults too—is
ours, and every effort will be made to
meet it successfully.

Boys and Dogs

Recently a group of eighty-nine boys
visited the Angel] Memorial Animal
Hospital. After a tour of inspection
throughout the institution they were en-
tertained by motion pictures projected
by our new sound equipment. They also
listened to a talk delivered by our Execu-
tive Vice-President, Mr. Eric H. Hansen.

We sincerely wish all our members
and friends could have been present and
observed the actions of the boys when
they went through the Hospital. One
could hear many calls of “H’ya, Princie”
and “Good Old Bosco,” while the boys
asked a thousand questions about the
dogs. It seemed like love at ﬁrst sight,
with all the dogs instantly taking to the
boys and the boys responding as only
boys can.

We believe it did both the boys and

the dogs a lot of good to get together.
They certainly appreciated each other.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Feeding Pets in Wartime

THE war is exerting a very deﬁnite
influence on the feeding of animals
in America, according to a program out-
lined by the Joint Committee on Foods
of the American Veterinary Medical and
Animal Hospital Associations.

One of the most important ingredients
employed in the manufacture of animal
feed is ﬁsh liver oil. The one commonly
used by feed manufacturers and animal
owners is cod liver oil. Other valuable
sources of vitamins A and D are shark
and halibut liver oils, sardine and other
ﬁsh oils.

With the war at sea now involving
the whole world, to obtain these oils has
become very difﬁcult—in fact, almost
impossible. The result is a rapidly-de-
veloping shortage of Vitamin A, and
rationing of this substance was ordered
by the War Production Board on Feb-
ruary 10, 1942.

Since the Government is in urgent
need of every possible ounce of tinplate
which can be obtained, it will, therefore,
no longer be available to manufacturers
of canned animal foods. Some of these
products may subsequently be marketed
in glass containers. There will probably
be a number of prepared basic products

available, but it should be kept in mind‘

that these may likewise be deﬁcient in
certain ingredients, such as Vitamin A,
and particularly since Vitamin A and
carotene gradually disappear in such
products when stored for any length of
time.

It is therefore recommended that the
animal-owning public conserve every
possible source of Vitamin A, and em—
ploy them to supplement their animal
feed.

The following contain either source-s
of Vitamin A or carotene and are, there-
fore, at this time exceedingly valuable
for supplemental purposes: medicinal
cod liver oils, tablets labeled to contain
Vitamin A, other oils such as halibut,
tuna and shark oil; dairy products such
as milk, cheese, butter and eggs; some
ﬁsh products, especially salmon and sar-
dines, animal livers, particularly beef,
veal, hog, lamb or poultry; green or
yellow vegetables, raw or cooked, such
as carrots, snap beans, peas, spinach,
lima beans, yellow corn. Do not discard
bits of butter and cream, but save them
for animals.

Should your animal become ill on the
diet customarily known to be satisfac-
tory, the difﬁculty may be due to a Vita-
min A deﬁciency. In such cases consult
your veterinarian to obtain accurate
diagnosis.

Don’t be wasteful. Save every food
ingredient containing Vitamin A or
carotene, and in this way help to keep all
animals in a healthy, thrifty condition.

A Fair Deal for the Dumb

ISTER FIDES SHEPPERSON, head
of the History Department, Mount
Mercy College, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
recently delivered a splendid radio ad-
dress which has particular interest at
this time of the year when we approach
Kindness Week.

In quoting some of the highlights of
the address we regret that space will not
permit a complete reprint:

“One generation of school children
throughout the world, humanely edu-
cated, thoroughly imbued with the spirit
of Saint Francis of Assisi, lover of all
life from highest to lowest inclusive,
would make wars forever impossible.
The great is in the small. International
amity, world peace, human brotherhood,
and a fair deal for the dumb are variants
of one and the same force; they differ
in degree not in kind; acting in unison
they will carry civilization higher and
ever higher even to millennial peace.

“So, aside from whatever good or com-

fort may come to animals as a result of

a fairer deal, I urge humane education
in the interests of the children of today,
the men and women of tomorrow. A
child’s sympathies cannot be aroused by
forms of life above him; sympathy ﬂows
down, not up; so, if not aroused by the
needs of pets, by the mute appeal of
forms of life beneath him, his plastic
capabilities of sympathy are not devel—
oped. There is then a hard sub-stratum
in his nature which remains harsh and
unlovely all his life, even though virtues
may ﬂourish above it. We all know men
and women of adult life, honest and
upright and very good—but harsh and
essentially cruel especially to animals.

“There is no evil in the world today
that could not be modiﬁed or even ren—
dered negligible if the public will to
remedy the evil were adequately re—en-
forced by the power which skill and
science and humane interest could readily
supply. There is no absolute good in
the world but good will.”

Animals and War

There is a handsome plaque in the
War Department building in Washington
which commemorates the magniﬁcent
contributions animals made in the ﬁrst
World War.

The present world conﬂagration has
been called a mechanized war—yet mil-
lions of horses and mules are helping
men do their deadly work. Let us all
hope that when peace comes we will
not forget the animals and merely erect
another memorial tablet, but demon-
strate our appreciation of their aid in
the ﬁght for freedom by giving them
better treatment and care than ever
before.

Man’s Best Friend
L u | u F u n k

Man’s best friend, they always say,
Is just a little pup;

So my fine dog runs through the house
And eats my slippers up.

He’s always faithful, so they say,
When sick he's by your bed;

So puppy dear with muddy feet
Walks gaily ’cross my spread.

He will defend you to his death,
Dog-lovers always say,

So when he fights with every dog
I pass it off as play.

It keeps me broke from month to month
To feed my little pup,

But I’ll sit by and calmly wait —
He’ll eat my income up.

Polish Larks

POLISH peasants have a charming leg—
end with which they explain the high
regard in which the lark is held in their
country. According to their tradition,
when Adam was driven from Eden he
went to live on a great barren plain, such
as that which forms the central terri-
tory of Poland. He was very unhappy,
and of all the lovely things he lost when
he left the Garden of Eden, it was the
song of the birds that he missed the most.
Therefore, to comfort him God created
the lark. Ever since that day the lark
has been Poland’s favorite bird, and it
is held in a respect that approaches rev-
erence. Tourists traveling through the
Polish countryside, unfamiliar with the
tradition, are surprised to see little
patches of grain left, for no apparent
reason, in the harvested ﬁelds. Upon in-
quiry they are always told that the spot
marks the nest of a lark. No one ever
disturbs the bird or its nest, even though
valuable grain must be frequently wasted
in order to avoid disturbing it.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Silk from Spider-Webs

ROBERT E. PIKE

UTSIDE of “trade” circles, it is not

very well known that silk, taken
from spiders, is extensively used both in
civilian and “defense” work—especially
on the lenses of precision instruments,
such as bomb and torpedo-sights, camera
View-ﬁnders, telescopic gun-sights, anti-
aircraft sights, theodolites, and survey-
ors’ levels.

Spider silk, not more than .0001 of an
inch in diameter is stronger than steel
wire of the same size, and is elastic so
that it remains taut and straight in the
instrument. The product from ordinary
house-spiders is not usable, as it is too
coarse. The best silk comes from the
weavers of orb-webs (ﬂat webs of wheel-
like design).

Different spider-farmers have different
ways of extracting the thread from the
spider’s body, but the general procedure
is to stimulate the creature’s nipple—like
“spinneret” (a cocoon-shaped organ with
which the arachnid spins its web) to
start the thread coming, which is then
wound onto a small ﬂat wooden or metal
reel, or U—shaped instrument, great care
being taken that the strands do not over-
lap.

Such silk is worth ten cents per foot,
and one spider may emit as much as 100
feet in the course of an hour, before the
supply is exhausted. After the opera-
tion, the spider is very hungry, and must
be fed.

Although it would take the combined
daily output of some 5,000 spiders to man-
ufacture one silk dress, there is no in—
surmountable reason that suitable insects
may not be raised commercially, and so
provide us with all the silk we need.
Nevertheless, only one man, a French-
man named Bon, early in the 18th cen—
tury, has ever tried to make cloth from
spider-silk. He manufactured smooth
gray stockings and gloves that royalty
was proud to wear, and which were said
to be superior to ordinary silk in both
looks and durability. It seems that here

is an opportunity for some enterprising
Yankee.

No ﬂuctuations in rate of income,
No waste of your estate by a will
contest.

>l= 3!: ‘JS *

Persons of comparatively small means
may, by this arrangement, obtain a better
income for life than could be had with equal
safety by the usual methods of investment,

our Society is “The Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals” ; that it is the second incorporated (March,
1868) Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the coun-
try, and that it has no connection with any other similar Society.

Any bequest especially intended for the benefit of the Angel]
Memorial Animal Hospital, should, nevertheless, be made to the Massa-
chusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals “for the use
of the Angell Memorial Animal Hospital," as the Hospital is not incor-
porated but is the property of that Society and is conducted by it.

FORM OF BEQUEST
I give to The Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals (or to the American Humane Education Society), the sum
of .......... dollars, (or, if other property, describe the property).

Belated Banquet
Virginia Grilley

Once more Dame Nature spreads a cloth,
A smooth white cloth for bright—eyed bird;
But with a strange perversity,

Forgets the feast . . it’s quite absurd.

Here are the sparrows . . trustful mites,
Anal starlings, somber in their best;

While blue jays know what hunger means,
Th0ugh cocksure souls, and better dressed!

I. watch them, as with hopeful look
They gather on the high-pilecl fence;
I must play hostess . . quickly, too,
And soften Winter's negligence!

Bird of Sunlight

Only on their semi—annual ﬂights from
Arctic to Antarctic regions and back
again do the Arctic tern ﬂocks ever see
real darkness. They leave their Arctic
nesting-grounds in late August, well
ahead of the long winter night which sets
in there, to ﬂy to the edge of the Antarc-
tic Circle, which they reach after day-
light is almost continuous. The sun never
sets during two months of their stay and
dips only a little below the horizon the
rest of the time. They return to the Arc-
tic Circle about May when sunlight is al—
most continuous there again.

This semi-annual ﬂight of about 11,000
miles in a straight line is the longest mi-
gratory ﬂight made by birds. It is es-
timated that they spend about ten weeks
en route each way. D.M.B.

Strange Bedfellows
LEWIS J. MERWIN

ATURE provides some queer depar—
tures from accepted biological pat-
tern but none more unusual than the case
of the cowbird. This irresponsible para—
site builds no nest and assumes no house—
hold duties such as other birds, but sur-
reptitiously lays its eggs in the nests of
other birds to be raised and fed by the
sometimes unsuspecting foster parents.
It would not be so bad if this shame-
less bird mother chose the nests of birds
of about her own size, but she invariably
selects the nests of much smaller birds
such as warblers and the smaller spar-
rows. One of her favorite victims is the
friendly little chipping sparrow which
usually chooses a nesting-site in the
small coniferous trees about our lawns
and gardens.

Occasionally one of the victims dis—
covers the alien egg and either throws it
out or builds another nest. In some cases
a new nest is built over the old one, or at
least a new layer of material is added to
cover up the eggs.

The British Isles have a counterpart
of the cowbird in the cuckoo.

The Killdeer—Harbinger of Spring

ALVIN M. PETERSON

HEN we talk about bird har-
Wbingers of spring, most folks are

likely to think of either the robin
or bluebird, or both. This is natural,
since both are common, much loved,
widely distributed, and among the ﬁrst
spring arrivals. Both are harbingers of
spring.

Nevertheless, we have several other
species that have about as good a claim to
the honor as the preceding. The red-
wing, rusty blackbird, ,grackle and mead-
owlark return about the same time in
spring as the bluebird and robin, whereas
the horned lark and crow nearly always
arrive three or four weeks earlier.

Look for the horned lark in February.
You are likely to hear it before you see it
and its "chip-c’hip—a-chee-chee" song is
sweet music to the ears. Look for it in
ﬁelds, where later the vesper sparrow and
perhaps the bobolink and meadowlark
make their summer homes.

In February the crow also returns,
provided it has not been present before.
Most crows spend the winter in middle
latitudes of the United States, where
they live in ﬂocks and roost in great crow
roosts in favorable woods. Naturally, in
middle latitudes, one is likely to see crows
all winter long. But farther north, one
usually sees little of crows during De—
cember and January, unless it be in par-
ticularly favorable places near lakes and
streams and in sheltered valleys not too
far from crow roosts, of which there are
a few in the southern parts of some of our
northern states. But with the coming of
February the ﬂocks begin to break up and

the birds to scatter and then crows are to
be seen in numbers wherever they are
common in summer, a sure sign that
spring is on the way. The ﬁrst crows
and horned larks, truly, are messengers
carrying good news and hence harbingers
of spring.

Thus far we have said nothing about
the killdeer, which also is among the ﬁrst
bird arrivals in the spring, a true har-
binger of this season. You will not see
or hear the killdeer as early as the crow
or horned lark. In fact, you need not look
for it until March if you live in our north-
ern tier of states, say the second week of
the month, about the time the robin, blue—
bird, red—wing and meadowlark return.
But then you should be on the lookout for
it. Most years I see robins, red-wings
and bluebirds before I either see or hear
the killdeer, though occasionally I both
see and hear the killdeer before getting
a glimpse of any of the former. Hence,
I ﬁnd myself wondering when March ar—
rives as to which actually will be the ﬁrst
to come with tidings that spring is at
hand, for you may be sure when you
see or hear any of these birds that the
weather is due to change.

The citizens of the State of Vermont
have always been progressive. When a
national ﬁeld organizer recently toured
the state, he found to his great joy real
enthusiasm for humane work—so much,
in fact, that he was able to organize six
humane societies. The example set by
Vermont might well be followed by many
other states.

The Pet Shop Problem

E recently heard about a pet shop

in Buffalo, New York, where a little
fourteen-year-old girl purchased a sick
pup with two dollars she had been saving
for her birthday. The case is so inter-
esting and, unfortunately, of the type
we too often meet with, that we give
you some of the particulars furnished
by Superintendent William Burns of the
Erie County S. P. C. A., Buffalo, New
York.

According to the report, the dog was
sick at the time of purchase, and three
days later had a temperature of 103°.
A veterinarian recommended that the
animal be put to sleep, which was done.
The owner of the pet shop was brought
to court charged with selling a dog with
a contagious disease, known as coccidiosis
or intestinal distemper, in violation of
New York’s penal code. The offender
pleaded not guilty, then changed his plea
to guilty, but later had another change
of heart and ﬁnally pleaded not guilty
and demanded a jury trial.

The trial took place on December 8,
1941, before a jury of ﬁve men and one
woman. The case lasted three days, and
during that time the S. P. C. A. presented
ﬁfteen witnesses and brought out some
interesting facts. The offender had been
arrested on three previous occasions—
once for dog-stealing, once for cutting

puppies’ tails and once for taking bets
on races.

Nine veterinarians were interviewed,
and all had treated sick dogs from this
pet shop. Checking with the Department
of Health showed they had made seven-
teen stops at the pet shop for dead ani-
mal-s during 1941. The S. P. C. A. had
twelve direct complaints about the shop
during 1941, and Agent Karnath took

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

seventeen sick and diseased dogs out of
the shop in one year.

When all the testimony had been pre—
sented and the attorneys had ﬁnished, the
jury deliberated for three hours and
reached a verdict of guilty. In pronounc—
ing sentence, Judge Patrick Keeler had
this to say to the pet shop owner, “The
evidence in this case has shown on your
part a cold, callous and cruel disregard
for the dumb and helpless animals un-
fortunate enough to come into your cus-
tody. You show a studied disregard for
the laws and you utterly disregard what
probably are some of the tenderest and
most nearly universal sentiments and
feelings that actuate and impel the civi-
lized people of this community and of
our country.” The defendant was sen-
tenced to one year in the Erie County
Penitentiary.

To Mr. Burns and Agents Karnath and
Sullivan of the Erie County S. P. C. A.
all praise for a splendid job performed
with skill and understanding. Echoes of
this conviction will be heard in many
parts of our country and may well prove
to be the beginning of the end of those
who so often cruelly ignore all rights
and lack any sense of kindness and mercy
for animals.

Loyal Devotion

Bob Becker, of radio fame, recently
told the story of a wonderful Missouri
foxhound named “Bingo.” This loyal
dog was loath to part with his master
who had been called to army duty and
followed 'him to the bus depot. The dog,
refusing to leave, chased the bus as fast
as his short legs could 'carry him, but
soon lost sight of it.

Fifty miles from the point of de-
parture, the soldier-to-be had to change
busses and, to his utter amazement,
found Bingo coming into this town, out
of breath but overjoyed to see his master
again. Unable to take the dog along, he
turned it over to the police department
which broadcast an appeal for a good
home for Bingo.

More than ﬁfty applications were re-
ceived, but none may get Bingo as we
learn just as we go to press that the army
may relax its rules and permit the dog
to be reunited with its master.

We hope our information is accurate
as the dog certainly has demonstrated
its loyalty and devotion to its master.
What marvelous instinct prevailed to
make this animal’s trip possible we do
not know. We can only admire the ﬁne
qualities of the dog which, in its des-
peration to follow its master, overcame
obstacles which would have stumped
many humans.

First Aid to Animals in
Wartime

Our headquarters building at 180
Longwood Avenue, Boston, has been
humming with the activities of animal
friends attending the ﬁrst-aid to ani-
mals classes conducted by the Society un-
der the direction of Dr. Erwin F.
Schroeder, Chief of Staff of the Angell
Memorial Hospital.

President Rowley has been gratiﬁed
by the excellent response, which at times
has brought as many as one hundred per—
sons to one class. Mr. Eric H. Hansen,
Executive Vice-President of the Society,
has had supervision of the course, which
has provided instruction in the following
subjects: Restraint, Medication, Hys-
teria, Shock, Hemorrhage, Wounds, Frac-
tures and Burns.

The ﬁrst-aid classes will continue in-
deﬁnitely as the sessions are already over-
subscribed with students anxious to be-
come proﬁcient.

Wild Ponies of Britain’s
Moorlands

E. R. YARHAM

DRASTIC restrictions on petrol have
brought the horse into its own
again in Britain, and a premium has
been placed on the value of the wild
ponies of the moors and hillsides of EX—
moor, Dartmoor, and Wales. Many have
been rounded up for use.

These shaggy little animals are among
the most picturesque features of Bri-
tain’s countryside, and there is a strong
public opinion in favor of their survival.
When instances have been reported of
these ponies being killed to sell as animal
food there is immediately a strong pro-
test in the press.

On the western moors these hardy
little creatures range the hillsides from a
thousand to two thousand feet up, where
they withstand the bitterest of weather,
sometimes being buried in deep drifts
for days. In winter they and the sheep
have the moors to themselves. The
ponies survive on holly bark and mosses
which they paw the snow away to get.
During more open weather they thrive
on heather, grass, and fern tops.

These ponies make splendid mounts
for_ children, for although extremely
nervous in the wild state, they quickly
respond to kindness, and are then docile
and sweet-tempered. They are sturdily
built, wonderfully sure-footed, and are
natural jumpers. Besides this they are
very fast for their size and unusually
intelligent.

The stallions form droves in the spring
and ﬁerce ﬁghts occur between the rival
sires as to which is to be lord and master.
Both hoofs and teeth are used in the com—
bats, and the struggles not infrequently
end in the serious injury or even death of
one of the battling stallions.

The origin of these wild ponies is
wrapped in mystery and has been the
subject of much discussion among Eng-
lish breeders. Some believe they are the
descendants of the ﬁrst wild stock which
roamed the moors and forests in prehis-
toric times, and others are of the opin-
ion they originated in horses which
escaped from captivity when the country
was far wilder than now, or they may
have been deliberately turned loose cen—
turies ago. Their small size is accounted
for by the fact that it is modern breed-
ing which has developed the splendid
horses of today.

Some control has to be kept over the
ponies or they would do much damage
in a country so small and intensively cul-
tivated as England. Although nominally
wild the ponies have distinguishing
marks on them, so that each moorland
farmer knows which is his. Then in
October, normally, they are rounded up;
certain ones are selected and are sent to
such markets as the famous pony fair at

Kindness to Horses

 

would be coming into Massachusetts
at the rate of one thousand per month
and, with the renewed interest in horse-
back riding, the Massachusetts S. P. C. A.
felt the need for calling attention to cer-
tain sensible rules and regulations for
the animals’ well—being and comfort.
In the photograph above, an agent of

][T was recently announced that horses

our Society is tacking up a poster in a
local riding academy. Hundreds of simi—
lar posters are advantageously displayed
in stables all over the Commonwealth,
and in the meantime our prosecuting

'ofﬁcers are on the alert for neglect and

abuse—situations often encountered es-
pecially with inexperienced riders and
drivers.

 

Bampton in Devonshire.

Rounding them up over these wild ex-
panses of hills and moorland is an opera-
tion not unaccompanied by an element
of risk. First of all an enclosure is built,
generally at the bottom of a narrow val-
ley. The catchers are mounted on fast
horses, and one ascends a near—by hilltop
to spot one of the droves. Each man is
armed with a ten-foot whip, and the
chase begins. Eventually the ponies are
driven towards the valley where the pad-
dock is situated.

Once the animals are inside the en-
closure the only outlet is effectively barred
with stout poles. The ponies are naturally
very scared and wild, but the men climb
over and each one mounts one of the
older animals. Then they drive the
young ponies to one side, and the old
stallions and the mares in foal to the
other. Finally each colt is tethered, then
the other ponies are allowed to go free.

Please remember the Massachusetts
S. P. C. A. when making your will. See
back page for proper form of bequests,
also for annuity rates.

Strange Beliefs About Horses

Horses have been right down the ages
the friends and helpers of man, and
strange beliefs and superstitions have
been attached to them.

White horses in some countries are
still held in veneration, and even have
been dedicated to particular gods. They
have been kept aloof, and not allowed to
be tainted by labor, and in some instances
have been sacriﬁced as ﬁt offerings to
placate certain deities.

Royal processions in our own times
would hardly be complete without an ar-
ray of prancing white horses which were
in old-en days portrayed as an emblem of
purity representing Royalty. It is still
supposed to be a lucky omen if you meet
a white horse in the early morning. An-
other quaint superstition in the country
districts is that if you meet your third
white horse and you have any money you
should turn it in your hand, wish a wish,
and it will eventually double itself, which
appears to be a better investment than
even the War loan.

A Tiny Mystery

CONRAD O. PETERSON

BOUT a week ago I pulled open the

bottom drawer of the old bureau in
my room to get my shaving kit. This
drawer is also ﬁlled with keepsakes,
among them a small pile of newspapers,
which I want to keep for reference.

I was astonished to see a small piece
of candy lying directly in the center of
the ﬂat surface of the upper newspaper.
How did it get there? A few days before
I had stepped on this identical piece and
had thrown it in the wastepaper basket
about eight feet away.

I again threw it in the basket. The
next day I found the same candy piece in
the drawer, again snugly reposing on the
newspaper surface. I have now thrown
it in the basket four times and on the
following day I ﬁnd it back on the news—
paper.

I believe it to be the doings of a
very quiet mouse, because I have never
heard it rattle the paper in the basket.
But why should it hide the candy on
top of the stack? Why not somewhere
in the bottom of the drawer? And. why
does it not eat it?

I have thrown it in the basket again,
tonight. If I find it in the drawer to-
morrow, I am going to place a note on
the newspaper, with the words, “Why
don’t you eat it, you Chump!”

The gods we worship write their
names upon our faces. EMERSON

“THOMAS” THE CAT OFTEN

 

Our Friend, the Toad

JAMES ALBERT DECKER

TOADS have long been held in dis-
favor by many people, chieﬂy because
these creatures are rather unattractive,
are thought to cause warts, and are sus—
pected of being poisonous. But few
creatures are as worthy of our protec-
tion as toads. The large quantities of
harmful insects which they destroy is
sufﬁcient reason to consider them among
the most valuable allies of the farmer
and gardener. It is estimated that the
worth of one toad to the farmer is $20
yearly, and many of the larger toads are
naturally worth much more. That sum,
too, refers to the toad’s destruction of
cutworms only. Toads also prey upon
tent caterpillars, gypsy-moth larvae, May
beetles, slugs, and many other pests.

TOads differ from frogs in that they
have no teeth, have warty skins, and
usually move with less rapidity than
frogs. Toads too are more terrestrial in
their habits. They also have a habit
of absorbing moisture through the skin,
and this is their only means of drinking.

Toads, like frogs, spend the larval
period in the water as tadpoles.

They are essentially nocturnal ani—
mals, venturing forth at night in search
of their prey, which consists wholly of
moving creatures. Toads hibernate in
winter, remaining under stones or other
cover until the warmth of spring calls
them forth to begin egg-laying. Toads
journey to ponds only for egg-laying
purposes, or in periods of severe drought.
Female toads are virtually voiceless in
comparison with the males’ singing abil-
ities.

 

Toads are hardy and can survive for
long periods without food or water, but
cannot exist for too great a time with-
out these essentials, the popular belief
to the contrary.

All toads shed their skins at various
times, swallowing the cast-off portion,
which is always in one piece. This shed-
ding of skin, however, occurs more fre-
quently in young toads.

Toads make interesting pets, and if
treated properly, they usually attain an
age of 30 years or more. They cannot
cause warts and may be held in the hand
with absolute safety. These warts of
the toad serve as protection, since they
exude a liquid which makes the creature
distasteful to its enemies. Children
should be taught to appreciate and pro-
tect toads which are readily tamed.

Boys Help in Defense Work

Mrs. Lucile V. Pullman, a teacher in
the Chandler School, Detroit, Mich.,
who has organized a Band of Mercy in
her school, writes:

“Both sections in our room gave pro-
grams last week. Many of the numbers
have been taken from your splendid
magazine and the booklets on humane
education that you have sent us
I don’t believe we could get along with-
out Our Dumb Animals in our work. We
ﬁnd the articles very interesting.

“Our unit in reading for April will be
‘Birds.’ Many of the boys are making

bird-houses and nesting—shelves so that
in the spring we will have homes for the
returning birds, which will help us with
our defense work in the conservation of
food by destroying injurious insects.”

Stray Puppy

Grace Bapst Mauer

He cowered low, then warin

He licked my hand;

I could not stand

To see him shivering with the cold;
Poor hungry dog!

I let him in;

He was so little and so thin;

I fed him well,

Then made a bed,

And, stooping, touched his grateful head.
I watched the gladness in his eyes
Mingle with a mild surprise.

He wagged his thanks

With stubby tail,

Promising love that would not fail;
And then I knew

By chance divine,

I was his, and he was mine.

A Thought for Animals

JASPER B. SINCLAIR

HISTORY contains many examples of

famous men whose ﬁnal earthly
thoughts were concerned with their
horses and dogs and other domestic
animals, and even with our feathered
friends of the air.

We are told that the last words of
Winﬁeld Scott, the American soldier,
were: “James, take good care of the
horse.”

Lord Grey of Falloden, the English
statesman, and Sir Walter Scott, the
Scottish poet and novelist, both made
the same request on their last days.

Lord Grey asked to be carried to an
open window where he might hear the
birds singing in his English garden. For
years Grey had personally fed those
birds every day.

Walter Scott was likewise carried to
an open window of his Abbotsford home
that he might gratify his last wish to
hear the birds singing their songs, to
listen to the murmuring waters of the
River Tweed, and to look out upon the
Border hills for the last time.

Just a few days before his passing
Daniel Webster, the American states-
man, insisted upon having the cattle
driven up the lane in front of his house
at Marshﬁeld, so that he could see them
from his bedroom window.

Webster also asked about his sheep
and his ducks at the same time. He
left instructions for the care of all the
animals and fowl on his New Hamp-
shire farm.

King Edward the Seventh refused to
permit his favorite dog, “Caesar,” to be
taken out of his bedroom. A few days
later Caesar was accorded the place of
honor at the head of the procession that
followed the British monarch through
the streets of London to his ﬁnal resting
place.

GOOD-BYE TO HIS PATIENTS,

A Kind-hearted Motorist

HENRY H. GRAHAM

OT long ago my beautiful and affec—

tionate dog, “Buck,” was playing
across the street from my home when
he suddenly saw me at the front gate.
Immediately he forgot his playmates
and started to run toward me, quite ig-
noring the automobiles moving along the
thoroughfare.

My heart ﬁlled with fear as a big
sedan approached rapidly. I thought a
collision with Buck inevitable and I re-
alized which would emerge second best.
The dog and car were apparently going
to meet in the middle of the street.

But the expected crash never occurred.
The driver of that sedan was not only
observant but the possessor of a kind
heart. Brakes screeched and tires skid-
ded as he brought the vehicle to an
abrupt halt—not two feet in front of
the terrorized dog. Had I been sufﬁ-
ciently near I am quite sure I would
have done my utmost to rescue Buck—
at the risk of my own life.

I thanked the motorist with all my
heart and complimented him upon his
vigilance and regard for animal life.

“I’ve never run over a living thing,”
he told me, “and I hope to maintain
that record.” There was justiﬁable
pride in his eyes.

This incident brought home to me the
tremendous risks faced by numerous
forms of animal life in this modern age
of heavy trafﬁc. Not a day passes with-

out seeing the life of many dumb crea-
tures snuffed out. Most of them die so
quickly they never know what strikes
them; others, maimed in varying de-
grees, limp off either to recover or die
miserably and alone.

Some accidents are unavoidable, of
course, but many could have been averted
by careful driving. The majority of
autoists do their utmost to dodge ani—
mals and birds. Only a few seem to take
a Wicked delight in going out of their
way to strike dumb creatures.

Not only tame animals like dogs, cats,
pigs, horses and cows fall victim to the
automobile but also wild creatures such
as deer, beavers and rabbits, to mention
only a few. Motorists speed through
heavily-timbereid districts, running into
deer in rounding sharp curves in the
road. Sensible driving would largely
eliminate this type of accident.

Beavers do most of their work at night,
often pulling segments of felled logs
across wilderness roads. When a rapidly-
traveling automobile comes into View the
animals frequently have insufﬁcient time
in which to reach safety.

It is the duty of every motorist to do
his utmost to avoid animals in the path
of his car. This requires constant vig-
ilance, careful consideration of animals,
and moderate speed. Our wild and d0—
mestic life is worth such caution.

Undoubtedly the lowering of the auto-
mobile speed limit throughout the coun-
try, owing to the tire situation, will do
much to conserve animal life.

In spite of War, with its black shadows
darkening the world, the Sun still shines,
the Planets hold to their courses, the
Stars keep their appointed paths as when
time was young, Day follows Night, and
Harvest answers Seed Time, as when the
ﬁrst sower went forth to sow. There are
still some things for which to be grateful.

We have all heard a great deal about
Bundles for Britain—for Blue J ackets—
for America; and the Angell Memorial
Hospital, not to be left out of the picture,
has been the recipient of many ﬁne
bundles of linen and cloth. We wish to
thank our many friends who sent this
much—needed material. It has been a real
contribution.

Early this year a bill was introduced
in the New York State Legislature which,
if passed, would have eliminated all the
worthwhile features of that state’s law
against the nicking of horses’ tails. Our
own Society last year successfully de-
feated a similar attempt to change the
Massachusetts law, and we rejoice with
our New York State neighbors in Gover-
nor Lehman’s decision to veto the bill.

We recently talked to an important
ofﬁcial of the Massachusetts school sys-
tem who told us that the schools in the
Commonwealth, while fully realizing the
need for encouraging patriotism in the
children, nevertheless stressed the fact
that after the war is over we shall very
likely again do business with and Visit
many of the nations now our enemies and,
in order to retain a fair sense of values,
should continue to study their people and
industries. Hate will not win the war—
only the determination to overcome all
obstacles can accomplish the ﬁnal Victory
which will be ours.

Why Is It Called “Our

Dumb Animals” ?

HAT is, why was this word, “Dumb,”

used in the title originally given our
magazine? The real answer is because
the founder of our two Societies, George
T. Angell, chose that name when he sent
the ﬁrst copy of it to the printer. That
was seventy—ﬁve years ago, when prac-
tically no laws existed to curb the cruel-
ties so commonly inﬂicted upon the great
world of animal life—a world thought of
as “voiceless,” with no voice to plead its
own cause or make known its God—given
rights.

Man’s thought about animals has risen
to far higher levels through these past
seventy-ﬁve years, till it seems almost a
reproach cast upon them to speak of them
as dumb. Do they not speak a language
of their own with eyes that look into
yours and tell of affection or distrust or
anger? Do not the sounds that issue
from their lips in bark, or growl, or
whimper, or in winning calls or songs
to their young or mates, proclaim them
anything but dumb?

And yet if you go to your dictionary,
we think you will see that Mr. Angell
was justiﬁed in his use of the word. This
is what you will ﬁnd: “Dumb: destitute
of the power of speech, unable to utter
articulate sounds; as, a dumb brute or
animal.”

Many times we have been asked why
we did not deem it wise to change the
name, using such words as “Our Friendly
Animals,” or “Our Animal Friends,” and
the best answer to the question has been,
“This magazine, the ﬁrst of its kind ever
printed, and which has gone out all over
the world for three-quarters of a century,
has carried the name so long that, though
a better name might be chosen, the better
part of wisdom has seemed to be to let

the old name stand.”

We appreciate the wish of not a few
of our readers that a different name was
not originally chosen, but trust they will
still continue to read the magazine in
spite of its “middle name.”

Did You Know That . . . a

Animals have long had a place on
regimental badges in English armies and
navies, so we are told by a writer in
The Animals’ Friend.

It is easy to understand why some of
the animals, so represented, are fero-
cious creatures, like tigers and lions, and
even less pugnacious animals, such as
elephants and bears and horses. The
strange thing is that a lamb is the em-
blem of the Queen’s Royal Regiment, and
the badge of the Royal Army Medical
Corps bears a serpent; the badge of the
Royal Army Veterinary Corps, a ﬁgure
half man and half horse. Even the
salmon, the bull, the cat, the bulldog are
also so used.

A Safe and Sane Fourth

This year, when the celebration of In-
dependence Day means so much to all
Americans, parents and animal owners,
at least in Massachusetts, can further
rejoice, as Stephen J. Garrity, State Fire
Marshal, has forbidden the use of ﬁre-
works.

For once we shall not have to read
about some little child who lost an eye
or was severely burned——nor will our
emergency ambulance have to work over-
time picking up badly-injured animals
often painfully burned by ﬁreworks.

Yes, it should be a happy celebration
we Americans can enjoy—to the envy of
the rest of this suffering world. Let us
make the most of it!

HANSEN, EXEC. VICE-PRESIDENT

NEW ward for the hospitalization
of dogs at the Springﬁeld Animal
Hospital of the Massachusetts Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
was formally dedicated on October 8 with
ﬁtting ceremonies. Members of the
Women’s Auxiliary, ofﬁcials from the So-
ciety’s headquarters in Boston, and sev-
eral hundreds of citizens assembled to ac-
quaint themselves with this new addi—
tion to the Hospital, where more than
166,000 animals have received treatment
in the past eleven years of its operation.
This new ward is modern in every re-
spect and embodies the latest improve-
ment in kennel construction and mate—
rial used. The twenty individual cages
have cement bases, translucent glass
sides, woven-wire tops and fronts and
each with a sanitary drainage system.
There are three different sizes of cages
for the accommodation of dogs, large and
small. The ward has a sound-proof ceil-
ing and is air—conditioned.

At the ofﬁcial opening of this important
adjunct to the Hospital it was announced
by Mr. Eric Hansen, executive vice-presi-
dent of the Society, that it would be
named “The Francis H. Rowley Ward,”
in honor of Dr. Rowley, and in recogni-
tion of his many years of valued service
as president of both the Massachusetts
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals and the American Humane Edu—
cation Society.

Dr. Rowley responded brieﬂy, express-
ing his gratitude that an active humane
unit such as the HOSfital wa1d was to
bear his name.

Thanksgiving 1942

HERE will be many empty chairs

when the family gathers for the an-
nual holiday. Some of them will be empty
because the boys are in service, others
empty because some member of the fam-
ily already has made the supreme sacri-
ﬁce for the nation.

The usual happy feast will be devoid
of all gaiety—it will be difﬁcult for many
to offer thanks. And yet, we have much
to be thankful for. Our own land still
free from the ravages of war, our health,
our family, our friends.

As we think of our beloved country
on this day of Thanksgiving, we are
grateful for the privilege of living here.
We like to think of the salty breezes at
Cape Cod and the winding roads of New
England, the rolling, rich cornﬁelds of
Iowa, the majestic expanse of the Rocky
Mountains, and the semi—tropical beauty
of Florida.

We think of George Washington, Lin—
coln, Lee and Sherman, and of the new-
est, pink—cheeked recruit in our new
Army. We think of our home, “be it
ever so humble,” of our many animal
friends. Yes, we are thankful and cou-
rageous in the face of coming events.
Strong American men and women able
to stand the strain will be the ones to
lead this nation after the war.

Flashing Courage

Jane Sloan

A fox, his coat all roughened,

And with fear that gave him might,
Was running hard from danger—

No tameness in his flight.

The pride of ancient swittness
And scorn of baying hound

Were written in his fleeing
Through dew upon the ground.

His heart-shaped face came nearer,
And there, within a breath,

I saw the shameless glory
Of a hunted beast at death.

The Family Life of the Fox

DORIS M. BALTES

][T is an interesting fact that the red
foxes, in spite of the demand for their
beautiful coats, have been able to hold
their own against fur traders and
sportsmen so well that they are still
abundant in North America wherever
there are woodlands left. The reason for
this is usually credited to Reynard’s
cunning, but another reason may be in
the family loyalty of the foxes.

Little fox cubs are not left to fend for
themselves. They are born in litters of
six or seven in the springtime. Their
home is a warm den that the two par-
ents dug out of the ground the previous
fall when the weather had turned cool.
Being monogamous animals, father and
mother fox hunt together through the
winter months and occupy the same den,
but while the cubs are small father fox
does the hunting and brings home food
for the mother and cubs. He no longer
occupies the den, but lays the food at its

entrance and lies down close by on guard.

If an unfriendly animal approaches, the
male fox will ﬁght to the death if neces-
sary to protect his mate and his young.
He is not even friendly toward another
fox that may appear on the scene. Such
a thing as trailing off with his fox
friends to celebrate the occasion does
not appeal to Reynard. His life is de-
vote-d to the little family inside the den
and nothing can lure him or frighten
him from his loyalty.

It is at the baying of dogs, which he
knows will be followed by men with
guns, that Reynard exhibits the utmost
in self-sacriﬁce for his family. At the
terrible sound he neither hides nor runs,
but is off to meet his enemies and to
lure them by his own trail far from the
home den. By devices so clever that it
seems they could have originated only
in the brain of man, Reynard keeps the
dogs on his trail until he has worn them
out or until the Sportsman’s gun has
ended the trail for him, but never,

Where the Ox Works

of Central and South America the
ox is widely employed. Hauling
bananas from farm to railhead in Costa

Guatemala, the ox plays its part in the
development of the rich agricultural

0N the “haciendas” and plantations

combination unique on the earth’s sur-
face, live the aboriginal Arhuaco Indians.

Dotted about the mountain sides be—
yond their settlements are patches of
sugar cane cultivated by the Arhuacos.
The cane when harvested is crushed be—
tween wooden rollers, operated by the

 

OXEN IN CHINANDEGA, NICARAGUA

lands of the littorals of these republics.
Among the stony ﬁelds high in the
Andes Cordillera of Venezuela you will
also ﬁnd him, drawing a crude wooden
plow, in exactly the same manner as his
predecessors in Biblical times. He does
his work well and cheaply, undeterred
by rareﬁed atmosphere or sloping terrain.
Another task the ox performs is crush-
ing sugar cane on the small “ﬁncas”
dotted about these southern republics.
The Indians have long learned his
value. High in the Sierra Nevada de
Santa Marta of Colombia, rising abrupt-
ly from the Caribbean Sea to a height of
about 18,770 feet, capped with everlast-
ing snow ﬁelds and glaciers, forming a

communal ox, plodding round and round
in circles. Boiled over a wood ﬁre, the
juice is run off into molds and allowed
to «solidify. The resulting brown cakes,
known as “panela,” are sold or bartered
in the lowlands, these transactions form—
ing the Indians’ only commercial link
with civilization.

And so the ox still retains its place in
agriculture, as it has throughout history.
Here in these sunny republics, whether
it be primitive Indian’s little patch of
cane or the great international combine’s
fruit plantations stretching as far as
the eye can see, on chilly highland or
sweltering plain, there is always work
for the ox.

 

never does he turn back to the den until
he is sure the danger is over.

In the meantime, while father fox is
providing food and protection, the moth-
er fox remains in the den for a few days
after her cubs are born and then takes
them out to teach them what young
foxes ought to know—how to obtain food
and how to watch out for danger. Under
her guidance they learn to hunt for rab-
bits and mice and to beware of the
crouching lynx or the shadow of an
eagle. By the following fall they are
full grown and gradually she leaves
them to hunt by themselves and ﬁnd
mates and dig out dens of their own,
while she roams again with father fox
and the next spring presents him with
another family. While father fox does
'his part, he is not as close to the cubs as
the mother.-~ '

Kindness to Animals Pays

Our ﬁeld worker in Georgia, Mrs.
Katherine Weathersbee, sends a clipping
from the Atlanta Jamaal, telling of the
emphatic declaration of Mrs. Don Harris,
64-year-old Walker County farmer, that
“You must love your animals if you want
to be sure of full"productivity.”‘ Mrs.
Harris, who operates a dairy of 36 cows,
visits her barn at 4 A. M., daily, to see
that “all’s well.” She contends that one
must handle animals tenderly, just like
children, and so avoid a lot of headaches.
She is keeping “Queenie,” the foundation
cow of the herd, although the animal is
22 years old. “I think just as much of
her as I do of my two-months-old future
herd sire,” she says. “Necessity led me
into the dairy business, and because of it
I’m staying out of the poorhouse.”

The Starlings in Saint
Patrick’s Ivy
Referring to one of the older churches in

Washington, D. C

Georgia Redway

I passed good old Saint Patrick’s
At dusk when the sun was down

As it loomed in stony splendor,
Clad in its ivy gown;

And I heard the starlings twitter
Among its darkling leaves,

As they sought their resting-places
Beneath its gracious eaves;

And I thought of the song of the prophet
From Israel’s holy sod —

“The swallow hath found a refuge,
Even the altars of God";

And I thought that our Lord must love it —
And Saint Patrick too, it he notes —

The starlings’ vesper twitter,
As it swells their dusky throats.

The General and the Bird

During an especially heavy engage—
ment, General Robert E. Lee once visited
a section of the front to inspect a battery.
As usual, wherever his presence became
known, a large group of soldiers gath—
ered about him and, almost immediately,
their presence attracted heavy ﬁre from
the Union lines.

“You men go to the rear,” the General
ordered. “Those boys over there mean
business.”

The soldiers moved back, but as the
shots fell closer, Lee calmly walked sev-
eral yards forward. There, he picked up
a small object and placed it gently on the
limb of a tree.

It was an unﬂedged sparrow, which
had fallen from its nest.

Britain’s Beneﬁcial Birds

E. R. YARHAM

food crops as possible in Britain
during the war is likely to react
favorably on its bird life.

For County War Agricultural Commit-
tees are not only waging a campaign
against such destructive pests as rabbits
and rats, but are taking a far truer View
of the real value of birds. In the past the
motto of the farmer was “Shoot any—
thing with feathers.” It is remarkable
proof of the revolutionary change in out-
look that even rooks, once condemned as
the inveterate enemy of .the farmer, now
have as many friends as opponents. Many
farmers now refuse to shoot rooks, be—
lieving the good they do outweighs the
evil. '.

Indeed, the number of destructive birds
is so small that they can be counted on
the ﬁngers of one hand. On the other
side of the picture, the debt we owe to
the birds is incalculable. Apart from the
blotting out of the sun, the world could
not suffer a greater catastrophe than to
lose its bird life.

Man’s deadliest enemy on earth is not
disease but the swarming life of the in-
sect world. If there were no birds there
would be no green-stuff on the globe
within a short period, and life would be-
come practically extinct. Recent obser-
vations and researches have brought
about a growing realization of the bird’s
place in the economy of nature, and the
imminent peril to food crops, should ver-
min and insect pests get beyond control,
has become apparent.

One of the leading scientists in Britain
who has helped to bring about the change
in outlook is Dr. Walter Collinge, who

A COMMON TERN POSES ON ITS NESTING GROUNDS

has carried out numerous inquiries as to
the economic importance of birds, and
British children are now taught the in-
calculable value of insectivorous birds, in
particular. A century and a half ago, on
the contrary, a so-called “authority” of
the day (1788) asserted that “Birds are
to be guarded against as being destruc-
tive.” It was this frame of mind which
led to the shooting of countless small
birds, and sporting enthusiasts shot all
the hawk type because they occasionally
took a pheasant or partridge. No wonder
rats, mice, and similar pests multiplied!

On the Continent shooting of small
birds still thrives as a “sport,” and as a
result horticulturalists say they have to
do much more spraying to destroy in—
sects than do British gardeners. In
France chickens have had to be kept to
attack insect pests in the vineyards, and
one of the evil results of killing birds
has been the spread of the Colorado
beetle, making it almost impossible to
grow potatoes.

Lord Jersey, English nobleman and
lover of nature, carried out recently an
experiment extending over ﬁve years to
show how birds help man. In the spring
the leaves of his young oaks were being
ruined by caterpillars. He put up nesting—
boxes for tits, ﬁrst 50, and the trees
beneﬁted accordingly; then 150, and now
there is practically no damage to his
trees.

One recalcitrant County Council in
England wanted to destroy larks, 10,000
of which eat 27 tons of food a year. An
inquiry was made, and of the food 35.5
per cent was found to be injurious in—
sects, 2.5 beneﬁcial insects, 3.5 neutral
insects, 9.5 grain, 1 leaves, 2 worms, 1.5
miscellaneous, 43.5 weed seeds. The lark
beneﬁts the farmer 36.5 per cent of food
eaten, is neutral 50.5 and injurious in
only 13 per cent. If 21/2 tons of cereals
are eaten, on the other hand, 12 tons of
weed seeds are destroyed, and as well
30,000,000 injurious insects and 30,000
slugs! A harmful bird!

In Britain these are among the most
valuable friends of the farmer: the pee-
wit, whitethroat, garden and willow war-
blers, blackcap, nightingale, chif‘fchaff.
The perky little wren also eats mainly
insects and minute pests, and the Min—
istry of Agriculture says that the hedge
sparrow is perhaps the most blameless of
all birds, its food consisting of insects
and, in the winter, of wild seeds and
berries. The robin also stands high on
the list of Britain’s beneﬁcial birds.

A Kind Deed

It was only a small incident in the grim
news of last week, but it served to prove
that human kindness still prevails.

The police ofﬁcer, the thoughtful presi-
dent of the Angell Memorial Hospital for
Animals and an employee of that institu-
tion who got together and found two live
rabbits to replace those stolen by a mean-
est thief from two little blind girls was
more than just a kind act. It showed
once more that goodness in human nature
more than offsets the bad.

Even the contemptible act of the thief
was overshadowed by the kindliness of
these three in dropping their routine
duties and giving their time to remove
sadness from the hearts of the two chil—
dren. In the week’s news the incident
shone bright. —Boston Post

The Playful Porpoise

H‘ENRY NICHOLAS

CIENTISTS have often debated

whether dumb animals possess a
sense of humor. Even those who take
the negative position, however, agree
that the porpoise seems at times to pos-
sess this peculiarly human trait.

In Marineland in Florida there is a
huge three-decked salt water tank. In
this enormous tank there are hundreds
of salt water ﬁsh living amicably to-
gether. Once a day a diver goes down
into this tank, equipped with a cloth
and an automatic cleaner, to clean the
ﬂoor and sides of the tank. When he
enters the tank the ﬁsh swim as far
away as possible from the diver.

This is true of all of the ﬁsh except
the porpoise. The porpoise continues to
swim back and forth apparently paying
no attention to the diver. It even seems
to make the pretense of not seeing him.
But if the diver relaxes his attention
for an instant the porpoise sweeps down
on him, grabs the cloth in its mouth,
and then dashes to the other side.

There the porpoise swims back and
forth, as if it were inviting the diver to
catch it and get the cloth back. It shows
every indication of pleasure at the trick
it has played on the diver. Sometimes
the diver enters into the Spirit of the
game and tries to get the cloth back from
the porpoise, but his clumsy movements
are no match for the swift gracefulness
of the porpoise.

There is no question that the porpoise
enjoys human companionship. Its relish
for human society, and the happiness
with which it plays around a ship, sets
the porpoise apart from all other inhabi-
tants of the sea. For centuries it has been
the favorite of the sailors of every nation.
When porpoises gather around a ship
and follow it for awhile on its course,

OUR‘DUMB "ANIMALS

it is regarded by sailors as an omen of
good luck. They regard it as meaning a
safe and prosperous voyage. When por-
poises approach a ship in the China seas
sailors believe it means an approaching
storm, and the ship is warned to steer
clear of reefs and head for harbor.

Sailors are convinced that many ships
have been saved from being wrecked
when entering a strange harbor by be-
ing piloted by a porpoise. For months a
school of about two dozen porpoises regu—
larly met and escorted the United
States Government boat on its daily trip
down the narrow and dangerous chan-
nel to Wrangel, Alaska. It was not until
the pilot of the boat became thoroughly
familiar with the channel that the por-
poises stopped guiding the ship.

The most famous of all porpoises was
“Pelorus Jack.” He was known to the
sailors all over the world. For thirty-two
years “Pelorus Jack” met every ship en-
tering Pelorus Sound and piloted it into
harbor by swimming out in front. No
ship it ever piloted ever suffered damage
in entering the harbor. The New Zealand
Government passed a special law to pro-
tect its life.

New Pets for Blind Children

It was a despicable act to deprive two
blind children of a pair of pet rabbits
which were stolen recently from the Bos-
ton Home for Blind Babies. The children
were brought to the Angel] Animal Hos-
pital by Police Ofﬁcer Frederick Perry
of Station 10, Roxbury, who was assigned
to investigate the theft. The kind-hearted
ofﬁcer’s ﬁrst thought was to obtain an-
other pair of bunnies for the disconsolate
children. Although no rabbits were
available immediately at the Hospital,
an employee, who specializes in raising
them at his home, supplied a ﬁne pair at
short notice. Two silky, black and white
bunnies were presented to the children
whose sadness was transformed into joy
as they were returned to their home by
their kind policeman.

Endowed stalls and kennels are needed
in the Angel] Memorial Animal. Hospital.
Payments of thirty-ﬁve dollars for a
kennel or seventy-ﬁve dollars for a stall
will insure a suitable marker inscribed
with donor’s name. For terms of per-
manent endowment apply to Treasurer.

On His Second Blindness
Dorothy K. Rhode

I remember well that fiery brand
Which charred my optic nerves with leap-
ing pain;
My heart was failing when you licked my
hand
And whined and led me to the world again.
We went romping through the woods to play
And found some sounds and odors in the
wind
To take the place of colors, in a way,
While at my knee your honest heartbeat
dinned.
This morning when I touched your shaggy
head
I did not hear your whimper; you had gone,
Unshackled from the man whom you had led
For seven years. Alone you met the dawn.

Believe me, your strong love meant more
to me
Than all those landscapes that I could not see.

Father D‘amien’s Work
for Animals

BARCLAY BARLOW

ROM data which researchers for the

Hawaiian Historical Society have un-
covered at the Bernice Pauahi Bishop
Museum in Honolulu, a hitherto unpub-
lished trait in the character of Father
Damien, the leper priest of Molokai, has
come to light. It is his kindness toward
stray dogs and homeless cats, to chickens,
birds and other creatures, as well as to
the plague—stricken lepers for Whom he
gave up his own'life.

The kindly young Belgian priest, who
ministered to the souls and bodies of the
lepers and even dug their graves, hated
cruelty to animals with stern magniﬁ-
cence.

When Father Damien ﬁrst arrived in
the Hawaiian Islands he was assigned as
an assistant pastor to one of the churches
on the Island of Hawaii, the largest of
the group. One of its chief industries is
cattle raising, so that its residents and
the denizens of the other islands may
have an occasional steak or beef stew to
vary the monotony of the traditional wild
pig and taro root poi. Particularly in
Honolulu, where even in Father Damien’s
time, there were many Americans, was
the demand for beef great. But while
the cattle thrived the stockmen were
handicapped by the lack of harbor and
transportation facilities, so crude methods
had to be used.

The ranchers drove their livestock in
the cool of the night to corrals along the
seashore. Just beyond the surf there
were rowboats. Anchored farther out
were barges equipped with windlasses.
The theory was that the cattle would
wade out to the rowboats and then per-
mit themselves to be guided through
deeper water to the barges. But the

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

stockmen miscalculated. The ani-
mals could be coaxed to the
water’s edge, but not beyond. No
gentle urging would get them
into the surf.

Finally, one of the cowhands
evolved the system of twisting
their tails. It worked like a
charm. At the barges nooses
were slipped around the steers’
horns and then they were hauled
on board with the winches.

Father Damien thought tail
twisting was cruelty 'to animals
and being hoisted up onto the
barges by their horns not much
less than that, so he started a
crusade against the practices.
The stockmen listened to his
arguments with stony silence.
When pinned down to the point
where they had to say something
it usually was: °

“Well, show us how to do it
more gently.”

The matter eventually was
solved to the satisfaction of
everyone concerned by the build-
ing of piers at several of the
chief loading points. Tails no
longer were twisted and there
was no undue strain on the
horns, thanks to the efforts of
the priest whose only thought

Page 147

 

BE KIND TO US

 

was for his suffering fellow men
and God’s creatures.

Father Damien also stopped the pluck-
ing of feathers out of the breasts of
living iiwi birds. They are clothed in
scarlet and up to the time of Father
Damien’s arrival they had been held by
the natives in superstitious awe because
their cries were supposed to convey di-
vine messages.

“Joey” Returns T 0 Life
GENEVRA BUSH GIBSON

Patrolman Sidney Turkheimer, who
is attached to the warrant squad in
downtown New York, had an eight—year-
old Scottish terrier, “Joey,” that he had
raised himself. The dog was a house-
hold favorite with the policeman and his
wife. And, what is more, Joey had won
numerous prizes at Eastern shows.

But Joey was ailing and the veterina-
rian had diagnosed the illness as an in—
curable disease. The Turkheimers talked
it over and decided that they should no
longer permit Joey to suffer.

Soon after November 1, 1941, Patrol-
man Turkheimer took Joey to the vet-
erinarian and there signed a paper
which was actually the terrier’s death
warrant.

The winter dragged on and spring
came but still the Turkheimers had not
forgotten Joey. One Saturday afternoon
late in May when Turkheimer returned
to his home from walking his beat, he

found a telephone message awaiting him.

He was directed to come to the Memorial '

Hospital where a friend wished to see
him.

Arriving at the hospital, Turkheimer
waited anxiously in the reception room.
Then an attendant led in a Scottish
terrier whose shiny coat and bright
eyes mirrored perfect health. The po-
liceman whistled, and the dog leaped
into his arms, wriggling joyously. In—
deed it was Joey returned to life. Even
the unemotional hospital attendants had
to brush away the tears as they beheld
the happy reunion between the dog and
master.

Behind this restoration to health was
a story of kindness and compassion.
When the veterinarian, who prefers to
remain anonymous, received Joey, he be-
lieved that there might be a slight chance
for the terrier’s life. He would make the
effort to save it. He consulted Dr. Halsey
Bagg, biologist of the Memorial Hospital,
who agreed to do what he could to save
the dog from cancer of the mouth. In
the time that intervened a cure was per-
fected. Then it was that hospital authori-
ties learned the identity of the dog’s
owner and Turkheimer received his pet
again.

The bloodhound is an aristocrat among
dogs and came by its name by virtue
of its blue blood, not because of any
special adaptation for scenting the blood
of criminals.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

From Australia

We have just received a copy of the
Royal S. P. C. A. Journal, published by
the Society in Sydney, New South Wales.
The organization is passing through a
very difﬁcult time but, with'courage,
states, “the colors of our great organi—
zation for the protection and care of
animals are nailed ﬁrmly to the mast.”

The Society’s many splendid activities
speak well for the people “down under.”
The Society celebrates Be Kind to Ani-
mals Week and Humane Sunday, em-
ploys inspectors to examine stock, main-
tains a convalescent home for horses and
dogs, has lethal chambers in many sec-
tions of the area served for the painless
destruction of unwanted and diseased
animals. The Society’s activities have
greatly expanded in recent years, and
we hope war will not interfere too seri-
ously with the splendid work our Aus-
tralian friends are doing.

It Is Now Dr. Barnwell

Friends of the Rev. F. Rivers Barn-
well, ﬁeld worker of the American Hu—
mane Education Society in Fort Worth,
Texas, are congratulating him upon re-
ceiving the degree of Doctor of Divinity
which was conferred upon him at the
Commencement exercises of Lincoln Uni-
versity, Pennsylvania, last May. Dr.
Barnwell, in addition to his humane work,
was for 22 years director of health edu-
cation for Negroes for the Texas Tuber-
culosis Association. He has been a resi—
dent of Fort Worth since 1913, when he
went there as a teacher of theology. He
received the AB. degree in 1908, and
the degree of Bachelor of Systematic
Theology in 1911, both from Lincoln
University.

Prize Cup for Best Essay

The Melrose Humane Society, through
the courtesy of a generous donor, offers
the Clark prize cup, a beautiful award, to
the seventh grade pupil in the schools of
the city who writes the best original
story describing some humane incident
or episode. This year there were 27 con-
testants. The winner was Shirley Dun-
can of the Lincoln school.

Twenty-seven states of the Union have
some form of humane education law.
How long will it be before the other
twenty—one fall in line? Humane educa-
tion makes for better international under-
standings, the overcoming of race preju—
dice, more reverence for law and order,
as well as better treatment both of
people and animals.

Please remember the American Hu-
mane Education Society in your will.

A Gun in the Home
LESTER BANKS

VEN during peace times a surprising
number of American families regu-
larly keep a ﬁrearm in the home; and
now that the United States is at war the
number will increase.

Even more surprising than the num-
ber of gun keepers is the degree of
ignorance among these same people of
how to use the weapons. Merely to shoot
a gun a few times doesn’t teach the
shooter much, and accident records indi-
cate that the uninformed gun handler is
about as likely to hurt himself as he is
the one who molests him.

Further, one member of a house—
hold, presumably the gun’s owner, may
be familiar with weapons; but only his
care, not necessarily his knowledge, will
insure safety for others of the family.
When guns are accessible to children it
is only a matter of time until deplorable
accidents occur.

One reader of newspapers collected, in
one year, seventy-ﬁve items about chil-
dren not older than ﬁfteen ﬁguring in
gun tragedies. They killed adults in
about one-third of the cases. One boy
eight years old while playing with a gun
aimed it at his mother and killed her.
Another boy four years old killed his
father. Playmates were killed in most
of the other cases. There were ﬁve
suicides among children who were
allowed access to guns. Most of the
cases resulted fatally.

Every one of these disasters could
have been prevented, by leaving no pos-
'sibility for the child to get the gun.
Even infants sometimes ﬁnd pistols
under pillows.

Even an air riﬂe is dangerous in inex—
perienced hands; many cases of blind—
ness have been caused by misdirected
BB shot. During the last few years
there has been a marked increase in
the use of .22 caliber riﬂes among young
boys in cities. The appalling risk with
ﬁrearms is at its very worst here; so
many people think the .22 “but little
more dangerous than a slingshot.”

All right, listen to this, quoted from
one of America’s leading authorities on
riﬂe shooting: “A bullet from a .22 has
a range of from 900 to 1,400 yards, de-
pending on the kind of cartridge used,
and will penetrate a man’s skull at this
distance.” At short range this “little”
bullet will go through six inches of wood!

Were I an educator, I would endeavor
to make my inﬂuence along the lines of
humane heart training my chief service
to my pupils—I would give them some-
thing that would place them at once in
the ranks of the noblest of the race.

Do Dogs Reason ?
HORATIO v. GARD

IS man the only member of the animal
kingdom that reasons from cause to
effect? Before commitment let the reader
study the dog episode about to be related,
for the truth of which I freely vouch,
then answer his latest belief.

“Judge” was a pedigreed collie. He
was called “Judge” because he came from
Judge Smith’s kennel. My friend, Judge
Smith, gave the dog to me to send to my
father who lived 'on a farm in southeast-
ern Illinois. Both parents of the dog
came from the famous Pierpont Morgan
kennels. So Judge had a good right to
feel proud of his ancestors, and to high
rank in dog society.

Judge had the markings of a high-
grade, well—bred collie. His new master
was justly proud of him, and built a com-
fortable doghouse in which Judge slept
at night, and sometimes in the daytime
when no cows were to be rounded up
and nothing else occupied him. It may
have been an oversight that no extra bed
was provided for a guest in the doghouse.

A relative was spending a week-end
with father and with the guest came his
own dog, a very homely specimen. Before
the sun had set the dog spied the vacant
doghouse and, being tired, pre-empted the
house for a night’s sleep.

The intruder could hardly have ﬁn-
ished his ﬁrst cat nap when Judge’s bed-
time came, and he made for his house to
go to bed. But, when he got there, to his
utter surprise and visible disgust he
found his bed occupied by the unwelcome
guest. ,

You will recall that Campbell in his
Pleasures of Hope said:

“His faithful dog salutes the smiling
guest.”

Now Judge cordially saluted the hu-
man guest on his arrival but up to this
time he paid little attention to the au-
dacious dog.

On this balmy mid-summer evening
Judge’s master and his guest were sit-
ting in the approaching twilight within
view of the doghouse, talking of old-time
incidents. Judge often disclosed traits
of high intelligence and father was accus-
tomed to watch for such traits to crop
out. Father observed the situation that
had befallen Judge, and quietly called his
guest’s attention to the predicament.
Both watched to see what would happen.

Both took pains to avoid letting Judge
know he was being watched because they
did not want to make the dog self-con-
scious, and they wanted events to take a
natural course.

Of course the ordinary dog way would
have been for Judge to force the intruder
out of his bed by a rough and tumble
ﬁght, which half a challenge to the un-
welcome one would have brought on, but
evolution had carried Judge to a state

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

of doghood where he seemed to feel
above such primitive rowdyism.

The onlookers saw Judge hang his
head to one side as if in deep meditation,
but his indecision lasted only a moment,
when he pricked up his ears and trotted
briskly some distance from the doghouse
and there set up a vigorous barking.

The sleeping dog, naturally excited by
the sudden outburst, rushed to the scene
of the barking to ﬁnd out what it was all
about. When Judge saw that his trick
worked, he relaxed his ears and paced
briskly back to the vacant doghouse,
carrying a look of amused satisfaction.
And well he might be satisﬁed, for he
caused his bed to be vacated and now
took possession of it without committing
a breach of the peace.

I have related this event to a number
of persons, some of whom made a study
of dogs, and all concluded that no escape
can be found from the conclusion that
Judge reasoned from cause to effect. And,
Mr. Reader, can you ﬁnd any explanation
of this episode without assigning to
Judge the human faculty of reasoning
from cause to effect? And, can any reader

conjecture a more peaceable and practir

cable plan by which Judge could have
taken possession of his bed than the
one used?

I think it was Madam Roland who said:
“The more I see of men the more I like
dogs.” And Madam Roland was a wise
judge of both men and dogs.

“INSTINCT AND REASON, HOW DIVIDE ?”

Nov. 1942

Australia’s Popular Animal
MABEL IRENE SAVAGE

HEN Captain James Cook was ex-

ploring the coast of Australia in
1770, some of his sailors saw a strange
animal watching them. It stood as tall as
a grown man, and it rested on its hind
legs, propped up from behind by its long
thick tail.

The curious sailors tried to get closer,
but the timid animal ﬂed in great leaps.
To their utter amazement, it remained al—
most upright in jumping, kicking itself
along with its great hind legs alone. It
landed with back feet together; then,
thumping the ground with its powerful
tail, it soared again in another long arc.

This was the white man’s ﬁrst view of
the great gray kangaroo, called the
“boomer” or “old man” by Australians.
It lives today mainly on the plains and
open forests of the interior and is the
largest of more than 120 species in the
queer kangaroo family.

The great gray kangaroo reaches a
weight of 200 pounds and a length of ten
feet from the nose to the tip of its
versatile tail, which usually is the length
of the entire animal, divided by two and
one half.

This gray monster can cover twenty
feet at a single bound and leaps easily
over rocks and bushes that turn aside
hunting dogs and horseback riders who
hunt the kangaroo as the Englishman
hunts the fox.

Mother kangaroos are very devoted to
their young, and if sudden danger threat-
ens while the young is out-
side the pouch, the mother
will start toward it at full
speed, gather it up in her
forepaws as she passes,
and tuck it in her pouch
without seeming to check
her ﬂight.

Timid as it is, the kan—
garoo ﬁghts desperately
when cornered. With its
forepaws it tries to push
its attackers down within
reach of a forward slash-
ing blow of the terrible
claws on its hind feet. It
can rip a dog to death
with a single stroke. But
the kangaroo is never the
aggressor, and whatever
fate befalls its enemies in
battle is a matter of:
“You asked for it.” When
pursued by a dog-pack, a
kangaroo very often takes
to the water and, if a dog
swims out in pursuit, the
kangaroo seizes it and
holds it under the water
until it is drowned. He
will avoid a ﬁght if at all
possible.

FADING TRAILS.

This is the story of American wildlife;
relating especially to its long and wasteful
exploitation and present status. Within the
short space of less than three hundred years,
a Foreword states, “the rich wildlife re-
sources have been reduced to a remnant of
their former abundance and some species
have gone forever.” Many more kinds of
birds, mammals and ﬁshes are on their way
down the “fading trails” even to the verge
of extinction.

However, a marked change has taken
place, a conservation movement for the pro-
tection of lingering species is steadily grow-
ing. We should regard it as the “trail to
recovery.”

This book was conceived and prepared by
the late Daniel B. Beard, famous biologist
and author. The various species treated
herein were selected and approved by a
committee of wildlife experts and well-
known authorities. There are many illustra—
tions with full—color plates, half-tones, and
line drawings. 279 pp., $3. The Macmillan

Man’s Dependence on Animals

M. H. MORGAN

HT was a dove that ﬁrst apprised Cap-
tain Noah, after his extended ocean
trip, that land was once more in sight.
The fall migration of birds attracted
Christopher Columbus to islands in the
Caribbean, which he, however, thought
were the shores of India.

Fish and fur led to the settlement of
the Eastern United States and Canada,
and fur opened the trails to trappers and
made necessary the establishment of
trading posts and river commerce.

Seals brought the Pribilof Islands out
of the fog, and made them one of the
greatest income producers of this con-
tinent.

Salmon, glutting Alaskan and Colum-
bian waters, each spring, were largely
responsible for the early settlement of
the great Northwest, and a source of
riches for the adjacent countries.

The Malemutes of Canada, faithful
servitors in transmitting the mails as
well as supplies to far-ﬂung, frozen
corners of the North, made it possible to
open up an otherwise inaccessible coun-
try.

Camels, plodding on splayed feet an-
cient Asian trails, carried the riches
of the East to western despots, linking
the various nations through commerce.

All animals contribute, in some man-
ner, to the comfort and sustenance of
man—through ﬂesh, fur or service.

All vegetation would be destroyed if it
were not that birds, particularly, reduce
the crop of devouring insects and grubs.

Man certainly owes the creatures of
the wild the right hand of fellowship.

Little sparrow, you are cheerful
Though the skies are dark and gray.
You are happy and courageous
In your work and in your play.

Though no beauty, like the blue-bird,
With your plumage dull and plain,
Nor a songster, as your cousin,
Still you chirp in sun or rain.

And the Southern lands entice,

When the frost has touched the meadows,
And the trees are gemmed with ice—

You are faithful to your homeland
Though few other birds remain.

Pets of Men of War

WILLA HOEY

John Lardner in his “Four-Footed
Friends of Men of War” tells of a
freighter that plies its way from Aus-
tralia to Port Moresby, in Papua, with a
load of bombs and high-explosives. He
says that the chief engineer always took
time off, around mid-day to currycomb
the ship’s rabbit, while a pair of monkeys
continued to chatter on the gun deck
above.

The Captain of the freighter, a trim,
soft-spoken Norseman, had brought his
dog along. The Captain was far from
home and all his waking hours were
divided between the dog and his job.

John Lardner goes on to say that no
matter how grim the circumstances sur-
rounding them, the soldiers and sailors
and merchant mariners of this war will
seek out pets wherever they can, and
cling to them. It is not a matter of try-
ing to improve their luck, for in no case
is an animal valued purely and simply as
a mascot, or lucky piece. His value lies
in his View of life. Entirely detached
from war, he deports himself according to
eternal principles, and this makes him
very good company indeed.

“Would Someone Pass The Soap?”

ATERBOY, two-year-old cat that deﬁed all laws

of the Animal Kingdom by going for a voluntary
swim at the Angell Memorial Hospital. Its former owner
further confounded hospital ofﬁcials by saying the cat
had always gone swimming with the family.

Oddities of the Animal Kingdom are always turn-
ing up at the Angel] Memorial Hospital, but Waterboy,
the cat that likes to swim, is probably the oddest one
of the lot.

The hospital staff was astounded one day last
month when Waterboy leaped from the arms of an
attendant and plunged headlong into a brimming tub
of water. Then, while the wide-eyed spectators looked
on, the two-year-old black cat circled the spacious tub
like a trained seal.

An attendant lifted the cat from the water and
placed it on the ﬂoor to see what would happen. An
ordinary cat would have asked for a towel, but Water-
boy bounded back into the tub and went for another
svwm.

A Cambridge woman, who had brought the cat to
the hospital in the hope of placing it in a suitable
home, was reached by telephone. Had her cat ever
gone swimming before?

“My goodness, yes!” she replied. “When we used
to go canoeing up in New Hampshire, he frequently
jumped out and swam to shore. Even when we went

A Question of Diet
R. ROTHSCHILD FREEDMAN

HIS is the story of “Marie,” a pet squirrel, who
could not stand prosperity.

Well-meaning visitors to Grifﬁth Park, in Los Angeles,
California, where Marie makes her home, were wont
to pass out sweetmeats and other delicacies to the like-
able little rascal. Due to this pampering Marie soon
developed some fastidious tastes, thus forgot how to
gnaw on such hardy foods as twigs, grubs, tree bark,
acorns and sundry items which her forebears ate to grow
into husky squirrels. And the result of her ignoring such
foods worried her indulgent keepers to a point that it
would have all proved highly amusing had it not been
so nearly tragic.

In short, her little-used front teeth began to lengthen
at an alarming rate, much like a canary’s neb will
grow when no cuttle bone is supplied, and presently
she couldn’t eat at all! One of her beaver-like incisors
began cutting through her upper lip, while another
curved against the roof of her mouth.

Zoo keepers were in a quandary. They held a pow-
wow and decided upon a little dentistry. Fortunately
for Marie the operation was a huge success and now
she’s as chippy as ever.

 

Cat Mothers Orphaned Bunnies

Mrs. Margaret Brown of Holyoke, Mass, lost her

foster mother and attracted much attention when she
and her strange babies were on exhibition at the
Springﬁeld cat show.

Dogs in England

CONSTANCE R. WINANT
inDogNews

THOSE who have seen dogs in Eng-
land during these times of war, as l
have done, will realize that they are no
mere “phase.” They are the close com-
panions of our brave English friends
bringing them a great measure of com—
fort and happiness through these sad
days.

Are there many dogs in England?
Have the kennels all closed down? Are
they breeding dogs? Are dog shows still
being held in England? And last, what
happens to the dogs in a blitz? These
are the questions which I am often asked
about dogs in England.

Yes, there are a great many dogs in
England still, and everyone seems to
want at least one dog. The kennels have
not closed down though most of them
have fewer dogs than in peace times.
However, I believe they have as many
good dogs as ever and they have, for
the most part, merely cut down on poor
stock. Breeding still goes on, though
the scale is more limited and only the
better stock is used for breeding pur-
poses. The spirit of the English people,
as you and I know, is very gallant, and
they are going to keep their great blood—
lines, which it has taken many genera—
tions to build up. As to shows, there are
still dog shows. Of necessity they are
small but there are many of them.

What happens to the dogs in a blitz?
Well, what happens to the children, the
women, the men? It is during these
very periods that the people
most need that strange sense
of comfort and companionship
which a dog invariably brings.

I remember one night in
London when it seemed that
“Jerry” had been dropping
tons of explosives for endless
hours. The sky over the entire
city was brilliantly lighted by
the ghastly orange glare of
ﬁre—ﬁre which had turned the
most thickly populated section
of London — the East End ——
into a raging inferno. Docks,
wharves, warehouses, and,
worst of all, the tenement
homes of thousands of workers
were bombed indiscriminately.
And it is to these great people,
that the dog, loved by so many,
brings joy and happiness
through. such sad days. We
may all be confronted with
bombings some day. Let us do
as the English do —— keep our
dogs, and keep smiling.

Willfully abandoning cats or
dogs IS a criminal offense.

Work of the Seeing Eye, Inc.

One hundred and forty-three students
were graduated with their dogs from
The Seeing Eye, Inc., at Morristown,
N. J ., during 1941. Blind students came
to the school from the District of Colum-
bia and thirty-six states. Statistics show
that 85% of all Seeing Eye graduates
had regular jobs, were housewives, or
students in college.

The trustees of the institution have
passed this Resolution:

“That in order to aid in the war ef—
fort, effective immediately, The Seeing
Eye will, at no expense to the Federal
Government, endeavor to provide Seeing
Eye dog guides for eligible persons who,
as members of the armed forces of the
United States, have lost their sight in
line of duty, giving such persons priority
over all other applicants for guide dogs.”

“Shep”——Faithful to the End

GLEN PERRINS

MONUMENT will be erected near

the railroad station at Fort Ben—
ton, Montana, in memory of “Shep,” the
Sheepdog for whom a funeral was re—
cently held by Mayor Shields, Boy Scouts
and dog lovers.

Shep won fame as the dog who met
all trains at Fort Benton in a forlorn
hope that his master, whom they took
away in a casket, would return. Rail-
roaders made a casket for the dog, and
at the funeral a Fort Benton minister
delivered a touching eulogy.

Shep was buried on a hill overlooking
the station to which his master failed
He had kept watch for ﬁve
years, until he met his death under the
wheels of a train. Shep accepted the
friendship of railroad men who fed him
and furnished him a home in the sta—
tion, but he never acknowledged any as
his master, and never went into the
town again. Day after day he watched
for his master, until death ended his
pathetic Vigil.

Mexico, are the homes of millions of
bats. When in ﬂight they look like a
vast black cloud, plainly visible for long
distances.

If a mole goes half a day without food
it will die. Because of this, it is of in-
calculable value to the farmer. It de-

vours many insect pests in the ground
that would otherwise destroy his crops.

Great Horses of Britain

E. R. YARHAM

HE “friend of man” is returning to

the streets of London and other cities
throughout Britain. It is no unusual
thing to see quite a queue of carts drawn
up at one of London’s few remaining
drinking—troughs, survivors of the many
of Victorian days.

This return to horse-drawn trafﬁc is a
result of the war with the severe restric-
tions on gasoline. Prices for good horses
are high, and dealers declare they could
sell far more if they could only get them.

Actually even before the war there was
a keen demand for heavy breeds, and
overseas buyers were placing many orders
in Britain. There was also a growing
interest in the horse for riding. This is
an age of mechanization, we know, but
people can get bored with continually
handling machines, and this led to a re-
vival of riding. Agriculturalists, too,
were swinging back from the extremes
of mechanistic farming, and were ﬁnding
that there is still room for the great
horses of Britain. ,

These have been famous from the
Middle Ages onwards, and during the
nineteenth century particularly, and even
right up till the present day, many ﬁne
Shires, Suffolks, and Clydesdales, besides
race-horses and hunters, have been ex-
ported for breeding purposes. Indeed,
it is perhaps not an exaggeration to claim
that Britain is the country from which
all lands have drawn their ﬁnest light
and heavy breeds since the days of the
later Tudors. There are still well over
a million horses in the country, and even
in war-time a certain amount of racing
is still permitted, as this deﬁnitely en-
courages the breeding of ﬁrst-class blood-
stock.

English sovereigns from the days of
William the Conqueror onwards have

 

EXPERT CAMOUFLAGE

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

taken a keen and personal interest in the
welfare of the country’s horses. During
the period when combat between knight
and knight was the rule the old English
Great Horse or Black Horse was the
supreme breed. The present-day Shire
is the direct descendant of these horses
which carried knights into battle. They
had to be immensely strong, for not only
were the knights covered from head to
foot with armour heavier than them-
selves, but the horses were also protected
by heavy mail. None but the strongest
horses could have traveled at anything
more than a walking pace.

The kings made every effort to main-
tain the size of the Great Horse and made
it ﬁt for both war and work. Henry II
imported sires, and even the unhappy
John was extremely interested in breed-
ing. He sent for 120 ﬁrst-class stallions
from Flanders to cross with native mares.
The same good word must be said of
another wretched king, Edward II, who
imported 30 Lombardy war horses and a
dozen mighty draught stallions. He re-
fused, however, to allow any English
horses to go overseas, being anxious to
keep all the best at home. Later Henry
VIII compelled owners with parks to
keep horses and to breed only the best.
Stallions had to be of large size and any
horse which gave no promise of making
up a strong and big animal was destroyed.

The strength of the modern draught
horse, result of centuries of selective
breeding, is astonishing. Some ofﬁcial
trials were held in London, and two
horses (they happened to be Shires)
moved the huge weight of 181/2 tons.
This was on wet granite setts, offering
poor foothold. Another time two horses
moved 161/2 tons. As a matter of fact
the shaft horse moved the load before
the leader got his chains properly tight-
ened. There was no fuss—the animals
pulled quietly and deliberately.

So proudly she grew,

A Good Bird Protection Move

WILLIS MEHANNA

HE Inter—American treaty on nature

protection and wildlife preservation
went into effect in May. It has been signed
by eleven of the twenty-one American Re-
publics and, so far, ratiﬁed by seven of
them including the United States. It pro—
vides for the preservation of wildlife, of
wilderness preserves and national parks.
Many of the American republics have
done less in the way of wildlife preser-
vation than the United States, and this
plan of calling their attention to it and
getting them to co-operate is so wise a
move that we wonder why it was not
tried sooner. The protection of such wild-
life as migratory birds can be successful
only by international co-operation. Most
migratory birds take in more than one
country in their seasonal ﬂights north
and south, and this makes it ineffective
for one country to protect them if others
do not. It is high time that such protec-
tion was being given to birds, and this
Inter-American treaty is a good begin—
ning. Let all nature lovers give it full
support.

The chimney swift has been clocked
at more than a hundred miles an hour.
Excepting the duck hawk, he is the
swiftest bird that ﬂies. And the unique
thing about this speedster is that his
wings beat alternately rather than in
unison. It has been estimated that in-
dividuals may cover a thousand miles in
a single day in search of food.

0 Woodpecker there in a riven tree,
You’re gay as a cavalier;

You’re a glint of Hashing red to me

On a lone bough high and sere.

You've built a home in the lichened wood;
You’ve carved a stairway deep;

Its walls have stormy winds withstood

As lightnings poise and leap.

I hear you -in the August heat

When every leaf is still;

Your ceaseless drum I hear it beat
“Tap-tap" through the hours until

My steps go down the valley way

Far, far from the broken tree,

But seeing you yet against the day,—
A flash of red to me.

Centipedes are beneﬁcial. They eat
only ﬂies, live insects, roaches, and will
not touch insect powders.

Certain water birds are useful to ﬁsher-
men, pilots, .and navigators. Terns or
gulls give warnings from their nests on
islands or rocky shores, thereby warning
seafaring men of dangers during thick
summer weather. Navigators in fogs

watch the birds going homeward with
food for their young, then steer their
course accordingly. Fishermen often dis-
cover schools of ﬁsh by watching the sea
birds in their search for ﬁsh.

DR. WILLIAM M. SNOW RECEIVED $3 FOR THIS

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Deer Protection
LUCILLE H. BECKHART

RESERVING wild life can at times

present serious problems to the
Game, Fish and Oyster Commission of
Texas and neighboring southern states.
They do all they can to protect deer and
to keep them evenly distributed through-
out the state. In spite of all their efforts,
some regions will become overstocked
and other regions will have scarcely any
deer in them.

The government, through the rangers,
and the ranchers, all working together,
transplant from 500 to 1,000 bucks and
does each year.

The adult deer are trapped and trans-
ported from one area to the other while
the fawns, which have been deserted by
their mothers, are caught while they are
still small and cared for until they are
old enough to take care of themselves.

The trapping of the grown deer has
always been a hazardous job. The deer
have been injured, often fatally. New
traps have been devised for this work
and are being successfully tried out in
the Southern Texas region. These traps
are of a type which catches one deer at
a time, and they cannot possibly injure
the animal. During the trial period, 15
traps were set out. The following morn-
ing, 14 of them contained an uninjured
deer.

The government pays the ranchers
$10 for each fawn that they care for.
In the autumn the
rangers drive to each
ranch that has re-
ported fawns in
their care, collect all
of them, and take
them to parts of the
country where deer
are not so plentiful.

The transporting
of the deer from one
part of the country
to the other serves
two purposes. The
ﬁrst of these is to
keep them evenly
distributed through—
out the country. The
second of these is
to keep the stock
strong by introduc-
ing new blood each
year.

EDITOR’S NOTE: It.
should be said in relation.
to the above, that if this
distribution of deer is for
the beneﬁt of the hunters
rather than for the deer,
which it probably is, it
would be far better to have
all the animals destroyed
before being subjected to
the mutilation of gunﬁre.

The Mule-s Are Coming
HILLIARD FOLEY

HE mule, despite his “mulishness,”

is coming into his own again. A
few decades ago the mule was every—
where a familiar sight—on the farm,
on the country highway, and in the army.
Horses, too, were far more numerous
then than now. With the growing use
of the farm truck and tractor the num-
ber of both mules and horses began to
dwindle. But the horse population has
decreased to a far greater extent than
that of the mule. Some ﬁgures before
us show a cut of one half in the horse
population during the past quarter cen—
tury, while the mule decrease for the
same period was only one ﬁfth—approxi-
mately.

The mule, then, seems to be the fa-
vorite over the horse, according to pres-
ent statistics. Today the Army beckons
to him welcomingly. There is so much
transport machinery for which he can
pinch hit, and in wartime he has always
been the faithful sidekick and pal of
the soldier. In the ﬁring line he has
proved his worth as a carrier of supplies
to the troops. He is no rattlehead in the
ﬁring line. He is strong-minded, but
sagacious. If you attempt to overburden
him‘you are a bigger “mule” than he,
as every muleman soon learns. His
overweight-load Will-not be delivered.
But give him a “decent” load and he
will see it to its destination. And this
is only sensible. Treated with kindness,
the mule’s so-called stubbornness soon
gives way to a pleasant disposition, he
becomes the greatest of pals, and will
stick to his buddy through thick and
thin.

The father of the mule is the male
donkey, his mother is a mare. The
parents of the hybrid known as the
“hinny” are the reverse of this. Hinnies
are not so large as mules and are less
useful for work. The mule, properly
managed, is a super—worker. In the
Army, no transport line would be com—
plete without its string of mules. It
has often been averred that no war could
be conducted without mules. Today the
mule trade is brisk. The mules are
coming. Let us make use of them to
the maximum—through kindness.

Nighthawks

Charles P. Isley

When the blue sky fades at evening—
Cautiously turns to gray,

The nighthawks scour the heavens
Seeking their insect prey.

They twist and turn in the shadows,
Pierce the dusk with their cries

As the sun falls past the woodlands
Leaving deep purple skies.

They skim the soft-waving treetops,
Hover, then dart from sight— _
Then darkness gathers her mantle
And covers them with night.

Nature and the Egg

Nature did a grand job when she de-
signed the egg round at one end and
pointed at the other, this characteristic
shape being more pronounced in the eggs
of Wildfowl than in those of domestic
kinds. Many wild birds lay eggs on the
bare rock of cliffs high above the sea,
with little or no nest to protect them.
So if they are disturbed, instead of roll-
ing off, they roll round and round, ending
up just about where they started from.
The peculiar shape of the egg is nature’s
method of saving it from wanton de—
struction which, of course, might result
seriously to the continued existence of
rare species like some of the Arctic birds
laying but a single egg. Usually, the
eggs of birds which incubate in covered
nests or in nests with side openings are
pure white, while the eggs of birds that
lay in open nests are tinted for camou-
ﬂage.

Whippoorwills and Nighthawks

GLADYS

'HIPPOORWILL, whippoorwill !”
WThis plaintive call, with its pecu-

liar rhythm, coming to us through
the shadowy twilight, again and again, can
not but hold our attention. And we begin
to wonder a bit about the bird that,
“mourns unseen and ceaseless sings.”

The whippoorwill gets its name from
its song, but around it hover some of the
pleasant superstitions of old England.
There is a tradition that no frost ever ape
pears after the whippoorwill comes nor
will it appear until after he leaves for
the sunny South. The English people
called these birds goatsuckers and once
really believed that they came out at
night and milked the goats. This belief
arose from the fact that the birds closely
follow the goats for the insects that are
about them.

The whippoorwills are rarely seen, but
they would be greatly missed in any
friendly neighborhood. Each year, when
I ﬁrst hear their call, I feel as though an
old friend has come back again. They
make no nest, but lay their two eggs on
the ground. Their food consists of in—
sects and their chief meal is taken after
sunset, when they sweep back and forth
through the air gathering any and all
that come within their range.

This bird loves the solitary woods but
it does not like the water so it is almost
never seen near the seashore. Its silence
in the daytime is almost uncanny. If one
happens to come upon the whippoorwill
suddenly it will rise almost without a
sound and ﬂoat silently away. Its dull,
mottled markings blend almost perfectly

with the tree branch upon which it
stretches out lengthwise. They walk but
little as their feet are small and weak,
but their wings are powerful and their
ﬂight easy and graceful.

Another of the so-called “goatsuckers”
is the nighthawk. This again is a mis-
nomer, as the bird is neither a hawk nor
a goatsucker. In old England it was also
called “nightjar,” and “bullbat.” It closely
resembles the whippoorwill, for which it
is often mistaken.

Instead of the weird cry of the whip-
poorwill, the nighthawk gives a harsh,
nasal, “pent, peent,” while ﬂying. This
is followed by a sort of whirring, boom-
ing sound that is produced by the air
against its outspread wings in its swift
descent from unseen heights. It dives
straight down toward the treetops as
though .bent on destruction, then, when
its fate seems hopeless, it sweeps in a
swift graceful curve upward and dis-
appears, only to return again and again
in the same stunt dive.

The nighthawks often hunt in com—
pany in the early morning. Seldom do
they hunt after sunset unless there is a
full moon. They devour thousands of
harmful insects. Like the whippoorwills,
they rest during the heat of the day,
stretched out on some branch that blends
perfectly with their plumage. They, too,
lay their eggs on the ground or on the
surface of a rock. In August, they bid
the country good—bye and take up a new
life in the big cities, where they seem
very much at home. It is not unusual
to see them resting happily on the roof-
tops or whirling about street lights where
they ﬁnd many insects attracted by the
lights. Their heavy wings have large
white spots that in ﬂying look like big
holes. The head is large but the bill is
small in the nighthawk but the whip-
poorwills have large ﬂy-trap mouths.
Each is a good friend, and an interesting
study to all bird lovers.

The goldﬁnches, with the exception of
the cedar waxwings, are the latest of
all our birds to build their nests. Usu-
ally not until July do these birds get
down to the serious business of raising
a family. If you have a garden with
marigolds, sunﬂowers, zinnias and corn-
ﬂowers in it you will surely have these
visitors. They especially like old ﬁelds
overgrown with thistles. From the
thistles they obtain ﬂuff for their nest

Sixty Days for Cruel Act

Mr. James Nankivell, Executive Agent
of the Minnesota Society for Prevention
of Cruelty, recently told us about the
splendid action taken by Judge John W.
Finehout, who sentenced Eric Bergstrom
to sixty days in the workhouse for cruelty
to animals. Bergstrom had thrown a dog
out of the third-ﬂoor window of the
Johnson High School. The dog suffered
injuries to its legs but is reported to be
recovering.

When counsel for Bergstrom protested
that the sentence was too severe, Judge
Finehout declared:

“The only reason the defendant is not
receiving the maximum penalty of 90
days is because he pleaded guilty and
saved the state the expense of a trial.
I personally investigated this case, and
found this was a friendly dog who liked
children and the children were very
fond of him.

“A man who would abuse a dog like
this would abuse children. This is one
of the worst cases of cruelty this court
has ever heard. It has aroused indigna—
tion wherever the facts are knoWn. I
am imposing this sentence, not only to
punish the defendant for his act, but to
deter others from any such act.”

Recently when Dr. Rowley addressed
a group of seventy children from the
Children’s Museum, visiting our Hospi—
tal, he asked them what virtue they most
prized in their friends and most coveted
for themselves — intellectual skill or
ﬁnancial ability. The answer the chil-
dren gave Dr. Rowley pleased him very
much, because they all wanted to be
KIND.

OUR DUMB‘ANIMALS

Vandalism

HE wanton destruction of bird and
animal life seems to be rampant in
many different parts of the country.

From Pueblo, Colorado, we learn that
not only were birds killed on the lakes
in the city parks, but trees, ferns and
ﬂowers were also destroyed. In Conrad,
Montana, farmers recently found that
vandals had clipped all the hair from the
manes and tails of one hundred horses
grazing on the range, and in San Fran-
cisco a Sixteen-year-old boy, who Shot a
dog, recently told the court his reason
for committing the crime: “I just felt
like shooting it.”

Mr. Friedrichs, in Our Animals for
June, offers an excellent solution to the
problem in suggesting a real campaign
through Humane Education. Vandalism
and cruelty are serious signs of a real
problem, and the humane movement
should be prepared to face the issue and
employ every possible means to further
the program.

Mr. Cotter Leaves for the Army

The United States Army gained a ﬁne
soldier and our Society lost a very valu-
able staff member, when our excellent
press representative, Mr. John F. Cotter,
recently entered the services of his
country.

In addition to his public relations work,
Mr. Cotter conducted a series of success—
ful talks and exhibitions of humane ﬁlms
before units of the Junior Police Corps
in Boston and gave addresses in a great
many parochial schools.

Mr. Cotter spent a good many years
in Washington as secretary to Congress-
man Higgins, and his many friends in
the Nation’s Capital and in Boston will
miss his genial personality and sincere
devotion to the cause.

Dogs for Coastal Defense

HE history of the present world

struggle will be incomplete without
an account of the contribution of our ani—
mal friends to the defense of our country.
And dogs, particularly, will be recorded
as having played the major role in guard—
ing against invasion by enemy agents
and saboteurs.

This is indicated by the latest recom—
mendation for the use of dogs on guard
and sentry duty. The recent penetration
of our coast defenses by Nazi Spies diS—
embarked from submarines has prompted
Lieutenant Commander McClelland Bar-
clay, of the U. S. Navy, to recommend to
his commanding ofﬁcer the enlistment of
dogs to prevent the repetition of such
enemy landings. Commander Barclay is
the well-known illustrator now at work
creating posters to memorialize the work
of dogs for defense.

He lives near the Long Island area
where the apprehended Spies made a
landing. “It is marked by a great num-
ber of foggy nights,” he reveals. “The
fogs are so thick it is frequently impos—
sible to see more than six feet. It is a
well-known fact that in this weather
the senses of smell and hearing become
much more acute. And dogs are the type
of animal that can take advantage of
this in the greatest degree.”

Commander Barclay proposes that dog
sentries be placed in Shelters along the
beaches, about a quarter of a mile apart.
They could then hear every sound within
that range and give warning. Coast
Guardsmen patrolling the beaches would
feed and care for the dogs. Each dog
could literally replace ﬁfty Coast Guards-
men at this type of wOrk, according to
Commander Barclay.

This recommendation is indeed a ﬁne
tribute to the courage, loyalty and spirit
of one of man’s best friends. The dog,
too, has enlisted in the ﬁght for freedom.

Nobody Home

Mr. Henry Gillen, of the editorial staff
of the Boston Post, who also is Poet
Laureate of his interesting paper, was
overheard telling of the intelligence of
his cocker spaniel puppy.

When all members of the Gillen fam—
ily are away from home and the telephone
rings, the puppy, according to Mr. 'Gil-
len, lifts the receiver off, barks into the
transmitter three times and then hang
up. ‘

Truth or poetic license, Mr. Gillen?

Endowed stalls and kennels are needed

Home Coming

Marjorie Hunt Pettit

He comes from the south when days are
long—

The Bobolink, with his bubbling song;

A tourist seeking a well-known scene,

Homeward bound from the Argentine.

The llanos know him; the pampas, too;
He’s Pan-American, through and through.
He needs no passport nor travel chart

To find his way into every heart.

Clover and hawkweed welcome him home—
Veteran flyer of field and foam;

Never failing throughout the years,

This vagabond of the hemispheres.

Tunnel Nesters
WILLIS MEHANNA

HE bank swallow is similar in appear—

ance to other members of the swallow
family, only smaller and not so brilliantly
colored. He is plentiful in localities where
high creek and river banks are found.
He is common in the United States and
Canada from April till October. He is
also found in Europe. All species of
swallows are odd in regard to nesting
habits, but the bank swallow is the oddest
of them all. He tunnels into the sandy
banks of brooks, rivers and the seashore
and builds his nest in these tunnels. The
nest is lined with feathers and spears of
grass and contains from four to six white
eggs. The bank swallow rears his family
in this tunnel nest which, because of its
location, is seldom bothered by intruders.
He is a great insect eater and is fairly
common in interior United States but not
so plentiful as along the Atlantic coast.
In autumn these birds migrate south in
large ﬂocks, more or less noisily, but
return in spring with less fanfare. It is
quite a delight in the spring to watch
these birds ﬂy in and out of their tunnel
homes. We should all be interested in
protecting them.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Man’s Friend —— the Bluebird

CALVIN WALKER

WHEN I was very young I once shot,
with an air riﬂe, a mother blue-
bird. She had been teaching, with ma-
ternal patience, a reluctant youngster to
ﬂy; and, in her preoccupation, made no
particular effort to get away from me.
She was sitting on a fence post when the
tiny pellet struck her; was resting there,
her soft reddish breast proudly full in
the fading sunlight. For a moment she
clung there, the deeper crimson slowly
covering her own loveliness. Then, after
a desperate struggle, she ﬂuttered help-
lessly to the ground. I picked her up then
and, holding the frail body in my hands,
tried to stem the ﬂow of blood. But it
was useless. Just before her eyes closed
she seemed to look at me as if I had
betrayed a friend. I buried her that
night in a tiny grave on the hillside, and
I made a small cross out of an old
shingle. Later, when I went to bed, I
cried myself to sleep.

No bird in eastern North America has
so sweet and amiable a disposition as
the bluebird. In his quiet and unobtrusive
manner he seems really fond of man, and
will build his grassy home in nearby
hollow trees or in birdhouses close to the
buildings. The mother lays four to six
bluish-white eggs and attends them with
a devotion almost human in its con-
stancy. When the young hat-ch the parents
comb the ﬁelds and woods, bringing in
caterpillars and grasshoppers to feed
their apparently inexhaustible hunger.
Along about the end of May the ﬁrst
brood quits the nest, their initial ﬂight
remarkably strong and adept. Almost at
once the parents proceed to create a sec—
ond family, ﬁlling each day with a cheer-
ful devotion to duty until, some time in
July, they once again become childless.

After the departure of the second
brood the parents are less frequently
seen, taking a well-earned vacation in
short ﬂights about the countryside. Al-
though, compared. to other bird-neigh-

Aug. 191,9

bors, they seldom sing, the bluebird does
have a soft and gentle chirp—like song.
And, of all the birds of eastern North
America, the male is perhaps the most
beautiful. The azure coloring that runs
his entire dorsal length from his beak
to the tip of his tail is as rich and beau-
tiful as a cloudless winter sky, and his
breast is the faded crimson of day’s
draining sunlight.

When, at long last, the ﬂora of the
northeast begins to fade, and the wind
takes on a new briskness, then the blue—
birds begin to think of a warmer clime.
Then, just before they leave us, their call
seems to say: “Far—away, far—away,”—
and I, remembering, bid them reluctant
farewell. ~

The ﬂat ﬁsh or ﬂounder is born with its
eyes on either side of its head, the same
as other creatures, but as it develops, the
eye on'the under side gradually moves
around until both eyes are on the upper
side.

The Golden Rule should be applied in
our relations with the animal world, just
as it should be applied in our relations
with our fellow man, and no one can be
a Christian man or woman until this
ﬁnds embodiment in his or her life.

Metropolitan Mallards

Seattle’s Seward Park on Lake Wash-
ington Boulevard is a game preserve
within the city limits in which a ﬂock
of mallard ducks have settled perma-
nently. Some tame white ducks joined
them there last year and now there are
quite a few speckled beige youngsters
of both wild and tame descent. At ﬁrst
they were fed grain every winter but
now that has been discontinued and the
ducks are forced to “crash” lakeside pic-
nics which take place all the year around
in Seattle. The photograph below shows
a deep—water scramble for a sandwich.

My Neighbor

Jessie Merle Franklin

Her dainty webhouse fully spun
Before I knew she had begun,
She fastened it outside my screen
High up within an evergreen.

And on spring days when sun would spill
Through leafy shades across her sill,

I fancied, as I plied my broom,

She, too, swept out her lacy room.

And I was glad that she had found
Such safe retreat on days that frowned,
For when it showered she could crawl
Beneath a snug leaf parasol.

Now some may smile to think I grew
Quite fond of her, or that she knew—
A little spider in a tree——

That she could keep me company.

But on the days when I would sit

Down in my room with thread to knit,
As though my company to win

She, too, would get out thread and spin.

Sea Gulls Build a Nation’s
Wealth

ALDEN MANN

HEN Francisco Pizarro, conqueror

of Peru, ﬁrst saw the arid West
Coast of South America, he must have
been astonished at the sight of the mil-
lions of sea fowl inhabiting the small
islands not far from the mainland. He
must have wondered why such myriads
of birds should be attracted to a rain-
less, desolate region like that —— a sandy
waste, save for the infrequent, glacier-
fed streams that came down out of the
mighty Andes.

But if Pizarro pondered on these
things at all, he no doubt gave them
only a passing thought. He was inter-
ested in the Inca wealth which, according
to rumor, the great emperor, Atahualpa,
had stored high in the highlands. Avid
for quick plunder, he turned his back
on a wealth that has endured to this day
and promises to continue indeﬁnitely —-—
guano, the deposit left by the sea gulls
or guanayes, on the many islands. The
sale of this fertilizer has built railroads,
highways, public institutions, etc., and
added greatly to the wealth of Peru.

Not all the credit for this source of
income can be given to the sea gulls,
however. Were it not for the great
schools of ﬁsh which sweep up the coast
in the icy waters of the Humboldt cur-
rent, the gulls would not remain there.
That is why they stay on those conven—
ient islands. The current brings their
food.

Baron von Humboldt, the great German

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

scientist and traveler,
was the ﬁrst to note that
this icy current, born in
the frigid regions of the
Antarctic, swept land-
ward at a point south
of Valparaiso, Chile,
thence northward along
the West Coast to the
southern border of
Ecuador, chilling the
surrounding atmosphere
and thereby giving the
West Coast, which nor—
mally would have been
very hot, a temperate
climate. This, too, was
conducive to the in—
crease of sea gulls.

Page ’77

 

GULL SOARING OVER MONTEREY BAY

 

This cold current, on
the other hand, keeps the region from
receiving normal rainfall. It is generally
known that the high Andean wall keeps
back the rain-bearing clouds from the
east, but some may ask: “What keeps
the rains from coming out of the west?”
The answer is—the Humboldt current.
It chills the atmosphere, and thereby
causes the moisture to fall out in the
Paciﬁc before it can reach the coast!
Thus, Nature has conspired to make the
West Coast rainless and temperate, and
to bring the gulls’ feed to them.

Today the guano busineSs is directed
by La Compania Administrativa del
Guano with ofﬁces in Lima. This com-
pany is capitalized at 2,000,000 sols, and
has complete charge of collecting the
guano, improving the nesting-grounds of
the sea gulls, and sale of the packaged
fertilizer.

The Peruvian government has passed
strict laws regulating the care of these
birds. Killing them is illegal. The habits
have been carefully studied, and the col-
lecting periods have been spaced so as
to cause the least disturbance.

Tractors and disc harrows are used
on the islands which have a topography
permitting their use. The more rugged
islands are hand worked, and rough sur-
faces are leveled in order to give more
nesting surface. Thus, the wealth on
which Pizarro turned his back is grow-
ing, yearly adding to the national assets.
Peru gladly assumes the role of host to
millions of sea gulls, and thereby proﬁts
handsomely.

The illustration above is used by cour-
tesy of the National Audubon Society,
as is that of the warblers on page 69.

The wren does not range far from its
nest. One pair was observed for a day
coming and going from the garden bear-
ing insects to their young. In an hour
they made from forty to seventy-one
trips with an estimated total of six hun-
dred insects for their young during the
course of a day.

Curiosity —— Plus!
EDITH ELIZABETH FEIGEL

E have usually thought of the deer

as being timid, of hiding them-
selves from hunters and the noise of
gunshot, but they have a strange streak
of curiosity in their make-up.

Away up on the edge of the Adiron-
dack Mountain wilderness in Essex
County, New York, they are opening up
some of the old iron mines in connection
with the defense program. New roads
are being constructed and dynamite is
being used to blast away rocks and trees.
The quiet and peace of the forest is
broken by the roar of construction
machinery and rumble of heavy trucks.
The adjacent woods are a natural habi-
tat for deer and other wild life and we
would naturally think of deer as staying
under cover. But no, instead of being
frightened by the noise and confusion
the deer come out of the woods, wander
along the roadsides and watch proceed—
ings with a curiosity that is beyond
comprehension. And, believe it or not,
according to the New York State Con-
servation Department, the dynamite and
dust from (blasted rocks are the piece de
resistance for bucks and does alike.
They eat it! It seems to be taken with
just as much gusto as the ﬁnest salt lick.

What in the world does dynamite con-
tain that would appeal to a deer? Ac-
cording to a forest ranger, it is because
of the saltpeter content. This ranger
tells of a road worker who wanted to
celebrate the Fourth of July in a man-
ner to be remembered, so he hid ﬁfteen
sticks of dynamite in the woods some
days before he wanted to use them. The
day before the Fourth he went to his
cache to get the dynamite only to dis-
cover that deer had eaten every one of
the ﬁfteen sticks. And there weren’t
any bits of carcasses lying around either!

OUR

Slum Clearance and Animal
Suffering

1N many parts of the country today,
large areas are being wrecked as part
of the Federal Housing Project of slum
clearance. Desirable as it is that hu-
man beings will now be able to obtain
better living conditions, the situation
has nevertheless brought about a great
deal of animal suffering.

 

ABANDONED ON SLUM CLE R—
ANGE PROJECT

Mrs. E. C. Dow, president of the Chi-

cago Humane Education Society, re—
cently told us how one of her most ac—
tive members, Mrs. H. Haglund, had
patiently and faithfully checked on all
wrecking projects and, through her ef-
forts, managed to rescue many aban—
doned animals, especially cats.

We congratulate Mrs. Dow and Mrs.
Haglund on the splendid work they are
doing, and call it to the attention of all
humane workers wherever they may be.

National Poster for 1942

Every humane worker and indeed
every friend of animals should become
familiar with the handsome new defense
poster, designed by Morgan Dennis,
which was illustrated in our last issue.
This is probably the most striking Be
Kind to Animals poster in the long
series that has been issued annually by
the American Humane Association. It
splendidly combines the idea of protec-
tion for animals with defense. It comes
in the national colors, 17 x 22 inches in
size. Send for your copy today. The
price is so low that everybody can afford
to buy a few copies for distribution.
They should be found in every school.

Single cop-y, 10 cts., three copies, 25
cts., eight copies, 50 cts., twenty copies,
$1, seventy copies, $3, 100 copies, $4.

Orders for 100, or less, may be sent
at once to the American Humane Edu-
cation Society, Boston, Mass.

Orders for large quantities, or for
copies bearing the imprint of local So—
cieties, should be sent without delay to
the American Humane Association, 135

Humane Workers

AQUESTION often asked is, “Who
and what are humane workers?”

For one thing, they are the men and
women who between year and day in this
country handle more animals than any
other group or groups put together.
They handle a number that easily runs
into the millions. They are most likely
to be men and women ﬁred with an
inspiration, who are willing to work day
and night, often for no salary at all
and in most instances for very meager
incomes. They are the men and women
who will answer the telephone for the
360th time in one day with a smile and
a cheerful voice and ask if they can be
of any service.

Humane workers are like the woman
in one of our mid—western states who
for many year-s has operated a Humane
Society. She is manager, office staff,
agent, ambulance driver—she is the whole
Society. The fact that she is a woman
has never hindered her in the least. She
raids cock ﬁghts, bull ﬁghts, dog ﬁghts,
or any other kind of ﬁghts, and she
appears before the court to prosecute

those who fail to take heed of her
warning.
Nor does she stop there. In her busy

time she manages to squeeze in a mo-
ment or two to write a column in one
of the daily newspapers. She is a hu-
mane worker. Consider the men and
women who faithfully toil for the fur-
therance of Humane Education—often
carrying heavy equipment on long trips,
speaking to many audiences, conferring
with school ofﬁcials—yet they carry on.
They too are humane workers.

We wonder how many of you have
met a man who sometimes shows up at
humane gatherings. He never secured
a degree from a university—in fact, we
don’t believe he even saw the inside of
a high school—but if he did graduate
from grammar school you can be certain
he is extremely proud of that fact. We
don’t know how he came into humane
work but he’s in it and in it to stay.

What jobs does he do? Well, he does
all kinds of jobs—he is the odds-and-
ends man—he drives the emergency,
small-animal ambulance. Sounds like an
easy job; well, it isn’t. It is one of the
most difﬁcult jobs, calling for more in-
genuity and good, common sense than
any job we can think of at the present
time.

He must be a resourceful fellow—and
he is one. He is the chap who invents
intricate rope arrangements which he
lowers into chimneys to rescue a cat
that has fallen in. He is the fellow who
climbs up steeples to rescue pigeons
caught by a piece of string and dangling
by their feet. He is the fellow who
goes down into sewers, whether or not
they are full of gas, and attempts to

If Mr. Angel], the founder of our two
Societies, could have listened to the four-
teen broadcasts given .by officers and
members of the staff during Humane
Week, he would certainly have sought
out Henry Bergh somewhere in the
Celestial Realm and exchanged congrat-
ulations upon the marvelous growth of
the movement of which they were the
founders in this country nearly seventy-
ﬁve years ago.

Humane Societies, and especially those
with animal hospitals, should air raids
occur, will .doubtless ﬁnd their services
increasingly demanded. So far as our
own work and Hospital are concerned,
we are making all possible preparations
to meet the emergency. Men, women
and children, of course, ﬁrst, but there
are millions of those who will risk many
a danger before refusing to protect their
household pets and other domestic ani-
mals.

Since this last war broke out, we have
had no word of the activities of any of
the humane societies in Germany, France
or Italy. That is also true of Belgium,
Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark and
Greece. Whether there is any money
left in these lands for humane work,
there still must be human hearts, loving
and doing what they can to prevent
cruelty to the defenseless animals that
are still left to them. With hundreds of
thousands in these stricken countries
either starving or near starvation, what
must it mean to what animals are still
left, and who will ever know how many,
that have for generations been thought
of only as household pets, have been
sacriﬁced for human food? Starvation,
. plague, these are only part of the hor-
rors war brings both to man and beast.

June,1942

The Call of The M. S. P. C. A.

Editorial in Boston News Bureau, April 20, 1942.

E properly should subordinate and

minimize many activities, such as
non-essential spending, which may im-
pair our war effort. But such concen-
tration on war-winning does not abrogate
or suspend certain qualities and impulses
which are really permanent, through
both war and peace. Also they may in—
cidentally aid us in waging the war.

Directly in that class fall the perma—
nent activities, for example, of such an
organization as the Massachusetts Soci-
ety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals. An interval of war augments
the need for all those activities. War
often seems to be the essence of cruelty,
even though waged for a noble purpose.
Anything which mitigates some of those
cruelties is highly commendable, as rec-
ognized in the founding and present good
works of the Red Cross. These are our
days and nights of blood donations, ﬁrst-
aid practice, etc. Also anything else
which promotes the spirit of kindness
and mercy, wherever possible, is an asset
to our morale.

Quite the same is true of our dumb
animals, which themselves are real if
unwitting assets. This is appreciated
in the provision of three Red Cross
courses for ﬁrst aid to any animal casu-
alties. Then there is the enlistment of
the animals themselves in direct war
work. Horses and mules have always
been patient and valuable drafted sol-
diers. So are pigeons. Dogs distin-
guished themselves in the ﬁrst World
War; now in all armies, including our
own, they serve again with zest and de-
votion when trained to many duties.
Hereabouts the M.S.P.C.A. is actively
co-operating in such tuition with the

under the Act of March 3,1879

lNo.6

New England Dog Training Club and with
the Army. These dumb draftees may
comprehend little, or even nothing; but
they are soldierly in their loyalty when
taught their duty. From every angle,
of asset value as well as the precepts of
kindness and mercy in a troubled time,
the M.S.P.C.A. deserves from the com—
munity a warmly sustained sup-port.

Children in a Democracy

A short time ago, Marshall Field,
chairman of the National Citizens Com—
mittee, White House Conference on
Children in a Democracy, addressed a
meeting in Denver, Colorado. Among
many interesting features in the ad-
dress, the following seems worthwhile
quoting in full, especially when we real-
ize the important role of humane edu-
cation during and particularly after
the war:

“There is another problem in child
health that is usually overlooked but
has become acute with the war situa-
tion, and that is the mental health of
children. The war is bound to leave its
imprint on them, but through intelli-
gent guidance we can avoid some of the
damage. We must help them to over—
come fears. We cannot allow deep-seated
race hatred to develop. (I was surprised
to learn that in one of our zoos the
Japanese monkey had to be removed
because the children were stoning him.)

“Let us remember that the attitudes
of children are dependent largely on
the attitudes of parents as expressed in
daily home life. Parents in these perilous
times have a deeper responsibility than
ever before. They determine the stand-
ard of morale in the homes. The morale
in millions of homes determines the
morale of the nation.”

The Hunt

Susie Montgomery Best

“Boot! Saddle! To Horse! Away!” ROBERT BROWNING

Boot and saddle! To horse and away!

The horn is sounded! The keen hounds bay!
They are off to the hunt at the dawn of day.
But for in the brake some timid thing
Born to the world without consent,

Living its life as it was meant,

Pricks its ears and prepares to flee

Swift as a bird on startled wing

From something it senses yet to be.

* * *

Boot and saddle! To horse! Away!
Kind God, be merciful! Shield the prey!

The Strange Dugong
EWEN K. PATTERSON

HE warm coral seas oﬁ" Northern

Australia are today the only part of
the world where those strange animals,
dugongs, may still be seen in any great
numbers. Also called sea-cows, these
peculiar creatures, which bear some re-
markably close resemblances to humans,
are the animals that gave rise to the
famous mermaid fable; they were re—
garded as half human and half ﬁsh, and
were treated with superstitious awe.
There are many references to these
“mermaids” in old sea records, as far
back as the days of Greek mythology,
and many maps and drawings of the
16th and 17th centuries show pictures
of the “ﬁsh-tailed women.” Unfortu—
nately, the creatures are fast becoming
extinct, and now rank among the world’s
rarest animals.

Despite their name, sea—cow, they are
by no means cowlike in appearance. Al—
though they live only in the sea, being
unable to move a single step on land,
they are air-breathing animals. The
males grow to about 9 feet in length,
and the females to 8 feet. They weigh
up to 2,000 pounds, or more, and their
body, of a dark-grayish color, is cylin-
drical in shape, gradually tapering

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

towards a half—moon shaped tail, with
which the creatures can swim at a great
speed, aided by a pair of fore—ﬂippers.
They have no hind limbs. Actually they
are land animals which, in the course of
ages, have become adapted to an aquatic
life; the hind limbs having disappeared
and the forelimbs become modiﬁed into
ﬂippers.

The animals have ordinary lungs, like
those of a human, and so cannot remain
long under water. They breathe through
nostrils at the end of the muzzle, and
at the end of their short “arms” or fore—
ﬂippers have “hands” resembling ﬁve
ﬁngers joined together by a web. One
of the many uses of these “hands” is for
carrying food to the mouth. The crea—
tures have a small rather human-like
head on which a short, stubbly hair
grows, while the males, with increasing
age, even grow matted beards.

The animals have small ears and eyes,
and in their mouth a tongue and teeth.
But it is in their internal structure and
skeleton that the resemblance to humans
is most marked. They are warm-
blooded, have a complex brain, and the
young are nourished some months after
birth on the mother’s milk. She suckles
her baby in a manner similar to humans;
when feeding the infant at sea, she holds
the baby to her breast with one “hand,”
and uses the other “hand” to swim,
keeping the head and upper part of her
body above the surface.

It is a fascinating sight to see a
mother and her feeding baby drifting
along upright in the water. In such a
position, especially when seen at dusk in
silhouette, the female looks so remark—
ably like a human that it is easy to un-
derstand how the famous mermaid myth
of the old-time sailors originated. Like
ordinary cows, the dugongs are vegeta—
rian; they live exclusively on a peculiar
sea-grass, known as “dugong-grass.”

The animals’ worst enemies are
sharks. It is due to the ceaseless at-
tacks of these sea-tigers that the harm-
less and defenseless dugongs are fast
becoming extinct.

Elephant Quiz
ONETA B. CHRISTIAN

0 you know that a full-grown ele-

phant’s meals for one day often con-
sist of one hundred and ﬁfty pounds of
hay, thirty-ﬁve heads of lettuce, ﬁfty
pounds of corn—stalks or green vegetables,
and ﬁfteen loaves of bread? However,
carrots and [bran are their favorite foods.
They have to learn to like peanuts!

Do you know that elephants in captiv—
ity often have minor foot operations?
Shufﬂing around in small quarters tends
to make the elastic substance on the soles
of their feet wear off unevenly. To ease
the pain that this condition causes, an
animal surgeon cuts away the excess
substance.

Do you know that an elephant’s tusks
are really his incisor teeth which con-
tinue to grow throughout the elephant’s
lifetime? The largest tusks of which
there is any record are eleven feet, ﬁve
and one-half inches long and weigh two
hundred and ninety—two pounds.

Do you know that elephants in captiv-
ity retain much of their jungle instinct?
For example, a herd of elephants will
not go to sleep all at one time. They pre—
fer to sleep in shifts. Also, elephants
who are housed in tents often become so
frightened during rain or thunder
storms that they are led out into the
open where they seem to enjoy them—
selves.

Do you know that elephants possess a
very keen sense of smell? It is believed
that they can detect the presence of a
human being several miles away if the
wind is blowing from the right direction.

Do you know that the famous elephant,
“Jumbo,” was bought in England and
brought to this country at a cost of
$15,000 and his owner cleared in one day
the whole purchase price?

Lucky Dog
LOIS SNELLING

I wish that I could be my pup,
Instead of being me;

He leads a happy, doggy life,
As lucky as can be;

He never has to change. his clothes
(You see, they’re part of him)

And never has to take a bath,
Unless we go to swim!

He never has to brush his teeth—
They’re always white as snow;
And doesn’t have to comb his hair,

When up to town we go!

A lucky fellow is my dog,
But I am lucky, too;

He cannot whistle tunes and sing
And talk, the way I do!

Ponies for Children

SIGMUND SAMETH

WHEN somebody told me that Olivarus Pinckney
lived with his family on delightful Harrison
Island, off the South Carolina coast, I asked what he
raised out there.

“Well, Olivarus raises two main crops,” I was told.
“You go out there yourself and see,” which I did.

The two “crops” I discovered were a happy family of
children and Shetland ponies, and could there be any
better combination?

“‘It looks as if God created the Shetland pony just for
children,” wise Olivarus conﬁded to me. On his tiny
privately owned island he has a herd of prize Shetlands
from which he is constantly shipping ponies North to be
used as mounts for children.

If you think that a Shetland pony could not carry an
adult because of the greater weight you are mistaken.
It is only because the Shetland has such short limbs that
he is unﬁt to serve man as a larger horse might. Full
grown Shetlands are usually only from seven to ten
hands high so that a grown man’s feet would drag on
the ground if he tried to ride one of them. However, the
sturdy sure-footed beasts carry up to 300 pounds apiece
when used as pack animals by the Welsh cotters. The
load is carried in two wicker creels strapped to the back.

Shetlands are extremely gentle. That’s one reason
they are so ideally suited to be the ﬁrst mount of a child.
In the picture, one of the Pinckney children, only eight
years old, is showing the author his riding posture, a
vigorous stance which demonstrates that the young rider
is far from timid on his small mount.

    
 
   

- I .‘
....uuuuuuw"

“IT LOOKS AS IF GOD CREATED THE SHETLAND
JUST FOR CHILDREN”

 

The number of Shetlands in this country is increasing
by leaps and bounds. Thousands of them everywhere
help instill in children a feeling of respect and affection
for four-footed creatures. Nobody who has ever owned a
horse himself is likely to stand seeing another abuse one.
And so our army of youthful Shetland pony riders will
be ready to champion the humane cause.

Plight of the Lost Cat

A CAT is just as hungry as a dog, after missing a
couple of meals. The poor thing has to search the
garbage barrels and the back yards for stray bits of
bread and scraps of meat. Immediately she is at. the
mercy of thoughtless boys who stone her, sick the dog
on her, and perhaps actually lay hands on her to
hurt her.

Now and then poor puss gets her head into an
empty salmon can. The smell tempted her and she
stuck her head in farther and farther to lick the good
oil. When the can was clean she tried to pull her head
out and found she couldn’t. When you empty a can
of any sort bash it in so that no animal can put its head
in the opening and get caught. ANGELO PATRI

George H. Sweetnam

How can I find good English words,
My dear old Irish Setter chum,
To eulogize your faithfulness,
Your loyalty and love, then some.
Marked by you, every step I take;
Alert, it seems to every thought.
Shadowed akin to F. B. I.
By you, in every object sought.

You surely know each word we speak;
You manifest the greatest joy

When speaking thoughts of going out
You’re boistrous as a rampant boy.

Or if, perchance, you’re not to go,
Chagrined, you humbly fade away

With poignant sorrow in your heart,

1 And sigh because you have to stay.

When bedtime comes you follow me
To see that every door is fast,
Then romp upstairs to lead the way
And into bed you are the last.
Then first to wake us in the morn
With cold black nose against our face,
Exactly on the dot of time
To start a new day in life’s race.

We've had our joy and fun beside,
Beneath God’s azure dome of sky,
Amid the alders, oaks, and pines
And meadows, cornfields — hills close by.
Then home, so sweet, there hungry, tired,
Ma welcomes us with open arms
And something good for each to eat——
Life has no better, sweeter charms.

Ah! dear old Rust, if all mankind
Could love each other as we do,
As taught by Christ of Galilee,
Then peace on earth would come anew.
You and your kin are man’s best friend,
God’s gracious gift to humankind
To teach us loyalty and love
As His desire; men’s hearts to bind.

Animals Made Them Famous
JULIETTE LAINE

AVE you ever thought of the great

number of persons who have be-
come famous because of their love
for, and understanding of animals? Not
only the great-hearted people whose tire-
less work has done so much to end the
neglect and mistreatment of animals, but
also the many artists and writers whose
pictures and books about animals have
given them world-wide renown.

For example, it is doubtful whether
there is anyone among present-day folk
whose name is better known or whose
work is more popular than our own Walt
Disney. Children and grown-ups in every
part of the civilized world have chuckled
over his delightful “Mickey Mouse,”
“Donald Duck,” “Pluto,” and all the rest
of the Disney menagerie. Other writers

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

who have become celebrated because of
their imaginary animals are Helen Eder-
son and Harold Pearl, who together wrote
“Dumbo,” Kenneth Graham who wrote
the amusing “Reluctant Dragon,” and
Felix Salten whose poignant “Bambi”
will continue to be read for many genera-
tions to come. Then there is Munro Leaf,
who knew and admired a little bull and
wrote a book about him. “Ferdinand,
the Bull” became so popular and made so
much money for Mr. Leaf that most peo—
ple have forgotten that he ever wrote
anything else.

Another who wrote many other books
but who will be remembered longest for
his animal tales is Rudyard Kipling. His
“Jungle Book” and other stories of India
are unforgetable. The same may be
said of Anna Sewell, who in 1840 wrote
“Black Beauty.” This beautiful story of
a horse caused people to forget all her
other writings. Similar is the case of Jack
London, who though he wrote many popu—
lar stories of adventure made his greatest
fame with “The Call of the Wild,” a dog
story. As for Albert Payson Terhune,
does one ever think of him without in-
stantly calling to mind his many dog
stories?

Among artists none is more famous
than Rosa Bonheur; her paintings bring
fabulous prices and hang in the world’s
ﬁnest art galleries, and they all deal with
animals. She was the ﬁrst woman ever
to receive the decoration of the French
“Legion of Honor” and it was presented
to her by the Emperor, Napoleon III, in
honor of “The Horse Fair.”

As for Anna Botsford Comstock, she
loved the forest creatures so much that
she worked for them all her life, writing
books, lecturing, and striving in every
way to preserve and protect them. In
return, she was named one of America’s
twelve greatest women.

Many other great-hearted persons
could be named, yet most of them would
never have known fame or fortune if it
had not been for their love of animals.

The purpose of a “Humane Week” is to
bring home the lessons of kindliness and
mercy toward animals, and to create a
wider, broader sympathy.

They Cry in the Night
CONRAD o. PETERSON

THE day had been one in which strong
north winds peppered the outdoors
with bits of driven snow. With the dark—
ness of evening the wind increased its
velocity until its blasts shook the house.
I rushed outdoors to make sure that the
garage doors were securely fastened.

Suddenly, I stopped, and listened! Up
above in the roaring darkness I heard an
eerie cry! “Geese!” I exclaimed, “Wild
Geese!”

I knew what had happened. The wild
geese, in their southward ﬂight, had been
frustrated in their attempt to land be-
fore the approach of the wild windy
evening. Man, was the answer! Man,
with his gun!

Wild geese ﬂy by instinct. This instinct
tells them of approaching bad weather,
and when this happens while on their
southward ﬂight they at once look for a
place to land. Usually an open ﬁeld or
small lake.

But sometimes a hunter appears. The
blast of his gun frightens the geese and
they then must travel onward, against
their better judgment. They should
land for safety, but dare not. Often too,
the hunter will ﬁre into the air in an
effort to kill and by so doing will break up
their formation.

This V shaped formation serves them
well when darkness approaches, because
they can follow their leader with a great
degree of safety. The leader at the point
of the V is usually an experienced traveler
and is one who has shown his ability to
lead.

It is when this formation is broken

and the geese become scattered, that
their trouble commences. They do not
know where to land and as the weather
becomes more severe, many must perish.

Wild geese left to their own devices
can. well protect themselves. Nature has
endowed them with the ability and in-
stinct to combat the elements and to
forage for themselves. But they live in
terror of man and his gun.

Pioneers in Kindness
MARY AGNES COLVILLE

T is gratifying to know that two
hundred years ago, long before the
formal organization of any humane move—
ment, there were outstanding individual
cases of genuine interest in the welfare
of animals.

In England in the year 1722, John,
Duke of Montague, a son-in-law of John
Churchill, the famous Duke of Marl-
borough, had a hospital equipped for the
care of aged horses and cows. None of
the Duke of Montague’s servants dared
to take it upon themselves to kill a
broken-winded horse who could no longer
be used as a mount. Instead the servant
knew well that he was expected to bring
the animal at once to the Duke’s hos—
pital—where it could rest indeﬁnitely,
and receive the best of care to the end
of its days.

Cows also who had grown old in the
faithful service of the Duke’s family
were treated with equal consideration,
and given all necessary hospitalization
and care.

The Duke was also very fond of an
ugly appearing old lap-dog, always pre-
ferring its society to that of other pets.
He lavished much affection on the homely
and aged canine.

The benevolent Duke was quoted by
his friends as saying that he preferred
the old or ugly pets, because no one else
would be likely to be kind to them. The
Duke reasoned wisely that these were in
need of a good friend far more than the
alert, attractive animals on the large
estate.

Certainly, the animals which he owned
were very fortunate to have such a
thoughtful master and champion in an
era when there was little general in-
terest in animals, and much heedlessness,
as well as extreme cruelty practised
toward them by many people.

The Duke of Montague was a pioneer
in kindness toward dependent dumb
creatures. But his benevolence, fortu—
nately, did not prove an isolated case,
though his unique idea of an animal hos-
pital privately maintained for the com-
fort of his own horses and cows, was a
singular undertaking. There were, how-
ever, among the more thinking persons
in different walks of life, in that and
other countries, other pioneers in kind-
ness, even at that date. These, possessing
similar feelings to those of the Duke,
held themselves personally responsible
for at least treating kindly those animals
for which they were directly accountable.
They planted a seed that later germinated
into a more wide-spread beneﬁcence
toward animals throughout the world.

The lack of humane education is the
principal cause of cruelty and crime.

Charles P. lsley

I paused upon the hill—
The bird, unseen,

Sent forth. his whistled notes
From the ravine.

My eyes ran up the slope,
lnquired in vain;

The sumac streaked the knoll
With crimson stain;

The white clouds raced across
A sky of blue—

The whistled notes rang down
The glen anew!

I found the radiant bird
A scarlet flame

That seared a picture on
My searching brain.

Winter Gleaners
ALVIN M. PETERSON

HENEVER I take a walk in win-

ter, Whether in the woods, across
the ﬁelds, or along the streets of a city
or town, and see contented, well-fed and
energetic birds, I wonder how they man—
age to get along so well. I scan the
ground and snow, notice the weeds,
bushes and trees, and am perhaps as
observant as most folks, yet it is hard
to see how winter birds can ﬁnd enough
food to keep them alive. However,
though the ground, snow and vegetation
look bare to us, they must look other-
wise to the birds. Who knows how many
good things they see that we overlook
entirely?

There are several things that enable
birds to glean a living where other crea—
tures would perish, but ﬁrst among these
must come the eyes. True, too, they are
able to subsist and perhaps even get fat
upon a scanty fare of things few other
animals ﬁnd even palatable. Neverthe-
less, their eyes are of inestimable help
to them in securing food. What we see
_ when in the ﬁelds and woods must be
I quite different from what a bird sees.

The visions of birds must be several
times as keen as that of human beings.
Take the turkey vulture, for example,
which may be soaring high in the sky,
entirely out of human sight. Let an
animal the size of a cat be killed and
left lying, or let it die a natural death,
and soon, ﬂying straight for the carcass
will come a vulture, and after it others
until all the vultures for miles around
have gathered for the feast. Small win-
ter birds like the woodpeckers, sparrows,
junc-os, jays, nuthatches, creepers and
others do not have telescopic- eyes like
vultures and other large carrion eaters,
but have microscopic eyes that enable
them to see tiny specks of food that

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

escape our eyes. No doubt what they see
with the unaided eye is comparable to
what we see with a strong magnifying
glass or a small microscope. Tiny weed
seeds, insects’ eggs and other equally
minute things are seen by them at a
glance. Watch juncos, tree sparrows and
other small birds feeding on the snow,
glancing quickly here and there, picking
up one tiny morsel after another, and
you will see and understand that this
must be true.

Birds also are wide-awake and alert.
They have nimble wits and are quick to
take a hint. Let one bird discover a
source of food and others soon learn
about it. Not only do they watch their
neighbors with those keen eyes of theirs
but they are quick to size up a situation
and to act accordingly. A jay may come
to your garbage pile one day and secure
food only to be followed the next by
several. Set out a bird food tray and
place suet and rolled oats on it, and soon
it will be discovered by a jay, sparrow or
other bird. It feasts and goes its way,
but soon others appear to be followed
shortly by still others. Let a bob—white
start to scratch and ﬁnd food, and its
comrades quickly take the hint, run up
to it and start scratching also. Or main-
tain a feeding station for bob-white, and.
if there are destructive hawks about,
they soon know what these chubby birds
are doing and" where they are keeping
themselves and beginto prey upon them.

Tibesar, pastor of Holy Trinity Church,

spring and summer the lawn is covered
with rings of ﬁne mesh wire where
Father Tibesar raises fresh crops of
pheasants, chukars, peafowl, and quail.
A large frame building which was once a
convent now serves as winter quarters
for tropical birds, a hatchery, nursery,
and hospital for those of the feathered
folk who may be ill or injured.

Father Tibesar’s ﬁne work began a
few years ago when a section boss from
Minnesota City came to him one day with
some orphaned blue—wing teal babies.
The man told of seeing the teal. mother—
bird crossing a railway track with her
little brood as an engine bore down
upon them. In her efforts to save the
babies she lost her own life, but she did
save her babies. The kindly priest took
the orphans and carefully raised them
until they were able to take care of them-
selves, and in so doing derived so much
pleasure and became so interested that
the idea of a bird sanctuary began to
take form in his mind. Later he en-
larged his original plans little by little
to include larger animals as well. Father
Tibesar’s work is so well known in his
part of the country that he has been aptly
re—named “the modern Saint Francis of
Assisi.”

TO give for Humane Education is to
insure a generation hating war and the
narrow nationalism from which it so
often springs.

THE Department of Agriculture says
that birds save the farmers more than
$400,000,000 a year. And so the birds
reduce the tax rate without even an
appeal to Congress.

WHEN one contemplates the madness
of men and nations in starting wars and
carrying them on, one does not wonder
at the words of George Bernard Shaw,
“The longer I live, the more thoroughly
I am convinced that the other planets
use our planet as their lunatic asylum.”

DR. Harris, who for many years was
Commissioner of Public Schools in the
United States, once made the following
statement before a large body of
teachers:

“If a boy is cruel, he must be edu-
cated out of his cruelty; if not, he will
become a bad citizen, and eighty per cent
of that class, sooner or later, will be sup—
ported by the nation as criminals. It is
less expensive to educate in humanity
than support as criminals later in life.”

A Bit of Stevenson

“Gentleness and cheerfulness -—— these
come before all morality; they are the
perfect duties. And it is the trouble with
moral men that they have neither one
nor other. If your morals make you
dreary, depend upon it, they are wrong.
I do not say ‘give them up,’ for they
may be all you have; but conceal them
like a Vice, lest they should spoil the
lives of better and simpler people.”

December, 1942

Christmas

VER since those early centuries when
men began to celebrate the birthday
of Christ as a religious festival, there
have been times when it has been by no
means to all who had honored it a day
of gifts and gladness. This world of ours
has had many a Christmas of famine,
ﬂoods, earthquakes, plagues and war
which have made the Day, only one of
many, saddened [by tragic suffering.

Hardly in such years have the words,
“A Merry Christmas,” been the greet-
ings within or without the threshold of
the home. Yet, dark as the clouds of war
are and all that war means of bitter pain
and loss, still these words will be spoken
this Christmas of 1942. Children will
hear them—children, thank God, whose
hearts are still too young for sorrow.

If we cannot wish all our readers a
Merry Christmas, we do wish them as
much of inner peace and gratitude as
Faith and Hope may bring.

DR. John Grier Hibben, former Presi-
dent of Princeton University, in a bac-
calaureate sermon once said, “There is
a cry today which is heard throughout
our land, ‘America ﬁrst.’ If this signi-
ﬁes, as I am afraid it is so often re-
garded, a self—centered policy and pro-
gram for our international life, I resent
it with all my being. I believe, however,
most profoundly in the idea of America
ﬁrst, if we interpret this national slogan
as America ﬁrst in the service of the
world.”

MEN still say that war always has
been and always will be. So for ages
men thought about slavery. And how
many thrones are dust from which once
issued the voices that ruled the world!

“Our Dumb Animals”—What
It Stands For

FROM its name, most people would ex-

pect to ﬁnd it concerned only with
animals. But the man who started it—
the ﬁrst humane Journal in the world——
a half century ago, had too wide a vision
not to see how interwoven are all the
multitudinous threads of life. He knew
that man’s relation to the animal world
had much to do with determining his
relation to his human fellows. He knew
that the child trained to be kind to a de-
fenseless animal would grow up into a
just and fair-minded 'citizen. Much as
he was concerned for animals, he never
placed them, or their interests, above
the welfare of men and women and chil-
dren.

To him, however, it was impossible to
draw any sharp line and say, “Here ends
the welfare of the animal; there begins
the welfare of the human.” It was the
humane idea that had possessed his soul;
that had set him against everything that
meant the suffering, the sorrow, or the
degradation of man or beast. To plead
the cause of justice, kindness, good will
toward every living creature, to smite
wrong and cruelty and unbrotherliness
in all its forms—for that he founded
Our Dumb Animals.

Who, familiar with the earlier days
of this magazine, does not recall his long
battle against the adulteration of foods?
No man probably did more in this coun-
try than Mr. Angel] to arouse public
opinion on that vital question. Against
militarism and war, against class ha-
treds, against all deeds of violence and
lawlessness, against the evidently brutal
forms of certain kinds of sport, against
the corrupt practices of men in high
places whose deeds meant injury to the
weak and unfortunate—against all these

A Humane Horse Trainer
VINCENT EDWARDS

F you had gone to the town of Grove-
port, Ohio, eighty years ago, you
would have seen the stage-coach that
came regularly down the pike and stopped
to let off passengers in front of an im-
posing mansion. They were Visitors who
came to view the house and grounds of
John S. Rarey, world-famous trainer of
horses.

His home stood on the site of the log
cabin his father had built when he cleared
his farm out of the Ohio wilderness. Even
as a baby, the son had shown a keen
affection for the horses and cows. Missed
from the table one day when he was only
four, the boy was discovered astride the
wildest colt on the place. The father
thought the youngster would surely be
thrown, but“ John reined in the animal
at the barn door as gently as if it had
been a tame kitten.

After that, John Rarey’s “way with
horses” became the talk of the neighbor-
hood. At nine years of age the boy was
already breaking in horses that many a
man feared to mount. At twelve he had
demonstrated that a colt his father gave
him had almost human intelligence.

John did so well in handling horses
that he was able to build up a prosperous
business as a trainer. Many couldn’t
understand why he was so successful. But
to the handsome lad with the blonde hair
and gray eyes and gentle voice, his
methods were no secret. From the time
he had written compositions in school on
“Man’s Best Friend—the Noble Horse,”
John Rarey had been convinced that kind-
ness pays in the handling of this animal.

How successfully he proved his theory
is shown by his career as a horse—trainer,
probably the greatest America has ever
produced. Rarey recoiled at the cuffs and
blows that were given by most men in
trying to break in horses, and he adhered
to a radically different policy for those
days. He expressed this brieﬂy in the
three words—“kindness, fearlessness, pa-
tience.” He saw this bring astonishing
results even in the case of wild horses on
the plains of Texas where he spent sev-
eral months.

At the age of thirty young Rarey felt
he had a real mission in life, and that
was to prove to the world that kindness
should be substituted for brutality in the
management of horses. First of all, he
went to England in the year 1857.

His reception was cool at the outset.
But after his ﬁrst successful demonstra-
tion where he had succeeded in handling
supposedly unmanageable horses, un-
friendliness changed to wild acclaim.
John Rarey was even invited to give an
exhibition before Queen Victoria, and
she was no less thrilled than her royal
guests by the young American’s lesson
in humane treatment.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

 

ANCIENT VEHICLE GOES TO SCRAP COLLECTION

 

Probably John Rarey’s greatest tri—
umph was in taming “Cruiser,” a blooded
race-horse belonging to Lord Dorchester
that had become Vicious and unmanage-
able after three years of imprisonment
and harsh treatment. The ﬁrst thing
Rarey did upon entering “Cruiser’s”
heavily—planked stall was to remove the
large iron muzzle that the animal had
been wearing for three years. In three
hours Lord Dorchester was able to mount
the horse, and it was not long afterward
that John Rarey drove “Cruiser” into
London. Lord Dorchester made the
trainer a present of the animal.

With “Cruiser” as a companion, John
Rarey made a triumphal tour of Europe,
giving exhibitions before most of the
kings and queens. In Russia he rode a
wild horse from the steppes, a present
from the Cossacks, that had never been
mastered before. Everywhere the young
American was received with enthusiasm.

After three years, John Rarey had ac-
quired a fortune of over a hundred thou-
sand dollars and decided to go home. He
built his ﬁne home and was always glad
to show his medals and horses to visitors.
But he did not enjoy his riches long.
Six years later, at the age of thirty-nine,
he died. At the very last he was heard
to exclaim: “If I could only get back
once more to the old farm, and put my
arms round my dear horses’ necks, I
believe I should get well.”

 

Editor’s Note: 80 remarkable was the career of John
S. Rarey and his record in the taming and training of
horses that some may be inclined to doubt the facts
as above related. What appears to be substantial
proof is extant entitled
‘Cruiser’ and the Rarey Method of Training Horses,”
written by Rarey’s niece and published in 1925.

RESPONDING to the salvage drive
for metal scrap the Massachusetts
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals contributed its heavy electric
horse ambulance for defense purposes.

This familiar vehicle had traversed the
streets of Greater Boston for more than
thirty years. It was among the ﬁrst of
the electrically propelled ambulances for
the transport of animals, and in its long
service had covered nearly 500,000 miles,
carrying sick and injured horses to their
stables or hospital. It will be replaced by
more modern type of vehicle.

The following letter was received by
President Rowley from the War Pro-
duction Board:

Dear Doctor Rowley:

As a representative of the War Pro-
duction Board, Salvage Ofﬁce, I wish to
express our extreme gratitude to you
and your associates for making available
to the salvage drive the handsome old ani-
mal ambulance, which we arranged to
have moved.

Not only does the metal in such a
vehicle mean much to the war effort, but
also your generous gift spurs other
groups to make similar donations.

I will arrange to make it possible to
have the purchase price paid by the auto-
mobile dealer go to the credit of the Chil-
dren’s Hospital through the Community
Fund.

Sincerely yours,

For Another’s Sake

ADRIAN ANDERSON

RETIRED professor living in the
Swiss Alps had a large dog of
undetermined breed which accompanied
him on daily walks in the mountains.
Their route generally led across a small
but turbulent stream, which they tra—
versed by leaping from rock to rock.

One day a small dog belonging to a
neighbor joined the pair on their stroll.
When the large dog, who was preceding
his master, reached the stream at the
usual place of crossing he began to leap
from rock to rock in his accustomed
manner. When he reached the middle of
the brook he paused and looked back for
his small companion, and discovered him
running up and down the bank in a
perfect frenzy of fear and indecision. It
was obvious that the little fellow was
afraid to follow his larger companion.
The big dog reﬂected brieﬂy, then turned
and made his way back across the stream.
Giving his little friend a reassuring
glance, he turned upstream and proceeded
along the bank for about a quarter of a
mile, the little dog following. There they
came to a bridge and crossed over and
soon joined the big dog’s master on the
other side.

For many months thereafter the little
dog intermittently accompanied the big
dog and his master on their daily stroll.
When the little dog was absent the big
dog always crossed the stream by leap-
ing from rock to rock, but when the little
fellow went with him he always remem-
bered his weaker brother’s fear of the
turbulent waters and made the longer
journey by way of the bridge.

Endowed stalls and kennels are needed

Watching for Wings of Peace
HARRIET SMITH HAWLEY

0 be a ground aircraft observer on

the crest of some New England hill,
is not as monotonous as it might seem,
even though there are days when for the
entire three-hour period, there is not a
single airplane seen or heard. For always
there are the birds soaring on wings of
peace and mounting towards the blue
with a song of freedom, their maneuver—
ing vying in pleasant contrast with that
of single and bimotors. And to watch
the season in and out with the birds is
to learn much concerning our feathered
ﬂiers, many of which hold long distance
records for non—stop ﬂights.

Take the swallows for instance, those
perfection ﬂiers that migrate back and
forth each year to South America, re-
minding us as they circle and dip of
Shakespeare’s famous lines:

“True hope is swift and ﬂies with swal-
low’s wings,

Kings it makes Gods and meaner crea—
tures kings.”

From my tower position on our hill, I
saw them ﬁrst dipping‘across the mead-
ows on the twenty-fourth of April.
Ambassadors of good-will from Latin
America, they kept the summer’s vigil
with us, swooping low to climb like pur-
suit planes with grace and speed. But
their sojourn with us was brief, for on
the morning of August 28 I saw them
making their circling round-up ready
for the Fall migration back. Round and
round they took their ﬂight, stopping
each time to line up on the Post’s tele—
phone wires, as if to count their num-
bers and make sure they were taking
with them their entire clan; pruning
their wings, in preparation for their long
journey.

The bluebirds, according to my tower
bird record, arrived on the snappy morn-
ing of February 18. I could hardly be-
lieve my ears when across the ﬁelds from
a gnarled old apple tree, I heard not the
roar of a motor but the velvety note of
the bluebird. Then to make sure, it
seemed, that I should know he had ar—
rived, he came and lighted on the roof
of our Observation Post. Like a bit of
blue heaven he seemed. Battle planes
might make black darts across our sky,
but here he was even in war times, “A
bluebird for happiness.”

Early, too, I saw the larks mount sky-
ward, heard the ﬂicker from swamp
maple, saw the red-wings zoom into the
alders and fox sparrows move in ﬂocks.
On March 11 there upon a near-by fence
post, I looked down upon a song sparrow,
head tilted back to sing his welcoming
note to Spring. Round my tower, the
robins hopped. Under a tangle of black-
berry bushes I could hear the chewinks
scratching.

Government Cats

N England many cats are ofﬁcially
recognized as servants of the State.

The Army, Admiralty, and Post Ofﬁce
Departments have for several decades
had common, ordinary cats on their pay-
rolls. In the Army they are useful in
keeping the troop camps clear of rats,
and their pay is set at threepence (six
cents), per day. The same salary is given
the “government ofﬁce cats.”

While all of these cats do practically
the same work, the post-ofﬁce felines are
rated somewhat more important than the
others because it is their especial task
to guard the mail sacks, for in the past
much damage was done by the rats nib—
bling through the sacks and destroying
the mail.

Britain is not the only European
country that has cats on its pay-roll.
France does likewise, as does Belgium.
In France, however, no cat is eligible
for a government job until she has served
an apprenticeship on a warship, for the
rats on these vessels are usually larger
and more difﬁcult to catch than ordinary
rats and mice. Thus, if she has proved
useful at sea she is retired to a land job
as a promotion and may consider herself
a veteran.

Dog Receives Medal
for Bravery

J. CASEY

ACLOCHE,” a brown and white
terrier, owned by a French sailor,
has the distinction of being the ﬁrst dog
in World War II to be honored by being
decorated for bravery, thus receiving the
Blue Cross Medal.

During World War I, eight dogs re-
ceived the coveted Blue Cross Medal for
heroic deeds. The medals were bestowed
by Our Dumb Friends’ League, a British
organization for the encouragement of
kindness to animals.

The story of LaCloche is this: When
Dunkirk was evacuated, Henri Bachelay
and his dog were rescued. After reach-
ing England the Frenchman wanted to
return to the home of his birth. During
the channel crossing, the vessel, Meknes,
upon which Henri and his dog were
aboard, was torpedoed. Henri could not
swim, so made towards a lifeboat, but the
tackle upon which he was sliding became
jammed and left him hanging in mid—air.
Seeing his dog dive from the deck, Henri
also jumped into the water. Receiving
a blow upon the head upon coming to
the surface, rendered the Frenchman al-
most helpless, but he saw his faithful
dog swimming in circles waiting for her
master. The dog seemed to sense the
grave situation at once, and grabbed the
clothing of her master and succeeded in
towing him 200 yards, when he was lifted
into a lifeboat. Barely conscious Henri
was unable to save his devoted friend.

Several hours later the occupants of
the lifeboat were picked up by a British
destroyer and when daylight came Henri
saw his beloved LaCloche riding on a
plank, swaying about in the sea. The

dog was immediately rescued and is being

French Navy, can return for her.

This is only one of the many stories of
devotion and heroism of the dogs in the
war areas.

The Earlier the Better
T. J. MCINERNEY

Y wife and I have always loved
dumb animals, so we do not ﬁnd it
surprising that our little son does, too.
We have not taken any chances of his not
being a friend of all dumb creatures,
however, and since he was old enough to
understand have taught him to be kind
to them.

He has literally taken our nine-year—
old fox terrier as his own, petting her
and helping to feed her. He shows the
same kindly attitude toward horses, cats
and other animals with whom he comes in
contact.

Kindness to animals should be taught
at the earliest possible age, for the
lesson will then become a part of a child’s
character. We are proud that our son
has inherited our love for dumb animals
and take this means of telling the world
about it. '

Nothing more rapidly reﬁnes, uplifts,

exalts both mind and heart, than gener-

ous, gracious, unselﬁsh ministrations to
others, whether our own fellow men or
the creatures below us.

Legends of Christmas Time
GERTRUDE CORRIGAN

HE Christmas spirit extends to the

humble creatures that were placed
here in the care of mortals, and whom
these mortals sometimes neglect or mis-
treat. Their dependence on the bounty
of man should be a reason for the exer-
cise on his part of mercy and tenderness.
The various messages that have come
through the story of Christmas are full
of lessons of kindness and justice to the
humbler creatures.

The story of the little Grey Lamb tells
of the longing in the heart of the small
animal to be white. The shepherds would
not take him with their snowy ﬂocks to
visit the Christ Child so he implored the
clouds, the moon, the trees, and the birds
to help him to become white. At last he
wandered until he came to the procession
of the Three Wise Men as they neared
the dwelling of the Holy Family.

The shivering little creature stood near
the door while the Wise Men worshiped
the Infant Jesus. The Christ Child saw
the lamb at the door and beckoned him
to come in. He laid His hand on the
head of the lamb and it became white as
snow. This is the lamb that one sees in
pictures, walking near the Savior. It
carries the cross. It has become the sym—
bol of the Lord in meekness and humility.

The story of the donkey in the pas-
tures of Galilee showed him to be a vain
creature who doted on his own long,
silky ears. He disdained the white horse
ridden by the Roman messenger who
came to tell the Carpenter of the gover—
nor’s order to be enrolled. But when the
Carpenter Joseph led the proud donkey
along the difﬁcult and tedious path to
Bethlehem bearing Mary upon his shoul-
ders, the haughty animal grew meek and
humble under the gentle burden.

When he returned to Nazareth, bear-
ing not only the gentle Mary but also
the Christ Child, the curious animals in
the home pastures wondered why the
donkey should not be more proud and
boastful than before instead of being so
humble in spite of the great honor he
had been given. They recalled his ex-
cessive pride in his silky ears. The don-
key answered that his ears had heard the
angels sing so he dropped his ears on his
neck in sign of humility.

And he told his companions that every
night, at the time when he had seen the
glory of the heavenly Vision, he awakened
from sleep and remembered what he had
been permitted to see. Stock men say
that at midnight, there is a stirring in
the corrals and stables. Because of the
honor that once befell one of their num-
ber? Who can say?

Planting for the Birds

MYRTES-MARIE PLUMMER

WE have a large oak and a maple in
our back yard but, as much as I
love birds, I saw very few until a friend
told me to plant sunﬂowers and cocks-
comb along the back fence. I tried it this
year and have been amazed at the many
different kinds of birds that come to par-
take of the seeds; often two different
species eat from the same plant.

Breakfast seems to be the important
meal of the day. Of course, I cannot tell
whether they are the same ones that
come every day or not but I believe many
of them visit me daily. I have seen
blue jays, cardinals, robins, blackbirds,
bluebirds, oriole, thrush, catbird and
sparrow. Also, the beautiful ruby-
throated hummingbird comes to feast on
the honeysuckle vine near by.

Invitation to Dine
Anna M. Priestley

When winter lays a snowy cloth
And days are not so tine,
I raid the cupboard for some food

And ask the birds to dine.

They never are particular
Just so that they are fed,
The scraps from our own table,

With suet and dry bread.

Sunflower seeds and cracker crumbs
And raisins for dessert;

Stale doughnuts, it I have a few,
Or cookies will not hurt.

With gravel after-dinner mints
And water in a dish---
No sooner is it ready
Than my guests come with a swish.

The starling and his family
Are apt- to lead the way;

The cardinal comes dressed in red,
His lady not so gay.

Woodpeckers are the most polite---
They always stop to knock;
The happy little chickadees
Are neatest of the flock;

The saucy English sparrows,
Although they may be small,

Are pretty sure to be on time
And get their share at all.

I hear a few sweet notes of thanks
When they have had their till,
Then Mr. Cardinal tunes up
And pipes them up the hill.

 

with the birds, I heard quite a commo—
tion coming from the wren-house on my
clothesline pole. I saw a sparrow trying
to intrude on the wren’s family residence.
He had tried to force his way into the
box but stuck amidship. There he was
with his head and part of his body in-
side and the remainder outside. He was
squeaking loudly and kicking. Soon, a
redbird ﬂew up to the wren-box and
picked and pulled at the sparrow, loosen-
ing a few feathers, then ﬂew away. Next,
a jay added his bit of help, and ﬁrst one
and then the other of the birds went to
the sparrow’s assistance, or whatever
their motive was. Before long they had
him out, minus a number of feathers,
then resumed their business of eating.
The sparrow ﬂew to the fence and sat
there quite a long while, blinking and
picking at his bare places. No doubt he
was thinking over the harrowing experi-
ence he had had. Finally he ﬂew away,
a wiser and better bird, we hope.

In the name of science, many a thing
is lawful that would put the ordinary
man in jail.

Children and Animals

OW naturally children are drawn to

animals, and what a fund of en-
joyment they both derive from each
other’s company. The need is that this
friendly tie be strengthened and, at the
earliest age, it be instilled in the child
that he has a responsibility to his animal
friend, to treat him kindly, and to look
after his requirements of food, shelter,
and a due amount of liberty. Humane
Education aims at emphasizing the value
of this comradeship in its effect on the
character of the child, and at the same
time the animal responds with ﬁne quali—
ties of devotion and affection.

There are movements in our midst
fostering co-ordination between children
and animals, and in America this has ex—
panded to a remarkable extent. The
American Humane Education Society has
formed 264,000 junior Humane Groups,
or Bands of Mercy, in which more than
6,000,000 children have been enrolled. The
Happiness for Animals’ Club aims at no
less a proportionate result.

The contacting of the Children’s Li-
brary Movement has become a source of
inspiration to animal welfare enthusi-
asts, as we discern far reaching possibili-
ties in co-ordinating for mutual service.

Odd Fish Facts

WILBERT N. SAVAGE

HE rolling ocean waves, so monoto-

nous in their movement, hide beauties
more vivid and shapes indeﬁnitely more
strange than any dry-land Vista.

The ﬂying ﬁsh is one of nature’s great-
est puzzles. Scientists cannot agree as
to its method of motivation—whether it
really ﬂaps its wings or travels by mo-
mentum. In either event it can ﬂy up to
250 yards, and has been known to alight
on decks of ships in its effort to escape a
pursuing enemy.

None the less odd is the climbing
perch of India, who saunters about on dry
land in search of water when there are
indications that his regular home may
dry up. His journeys are necessarily
short, and this remarkable fellow travels
only at night or early morning while
there is sufficient dew to keep his gills
moist.

Outstanding phenomenon of the lower
ﬁshes is the electric eel. It can deliver
enough electric current to stun a man and
render him helpless
momentarily. The
“charge” comes from
highly potent elec-
tric cells along the
eel’s sides.

If you should drive
an oar-ﬁsh—perhaps
the ugliest of all
ﬁshes—from the icy
depths of the ocean
to shallow water, its
body would swell and
burst, for it is not
made to withstand
low water pressure.

The sting-ray ﬁsh,
whose body is al—
most round, carries
a poison barb at the
end of its whip—like
tail, and uses it with-
out discretion if an—
noyed.

The sawﬁsh is a
moody fellow. When
stirred to action he is
a ﬁerce ﬁghter. The
octopus and cuttle-
ﬁsh are two crea-
tures he will not tol-
erate, and he attacks
them on sight.

Fishes of the trop-
ics are often bril-
liantly colored. The
parrot ﬁsh of the
tropical seas have
vivid colorings of red
and green and yel-
low. Some even glow
with an eerie phos-
phorescent light.

Runs through the leaves
Spattered with red,
Seeks for the shelter
Of some hidden bed.

Louder that sound than

With nothing to watch
But the sky’s face.

Antlered Animals
V. T. J O H N S O N

HE deer, with a full set of antlers,

cuts one of the most impressive ﬁg-
ures of all animals. Certain species, such
as the Wapiti, or Elk, the rare Tibetan
Shou, and the Moose, display magniﬁcent
sets, often measuring up to six feet in
length and weighing in the neighbor—
hood of a hundred pounds. This may not
seem such a marvelous accomplishment
until we learn that early in the spring
the males shed last season’s horns and
begin to grow a new pair of antlers.

Naturalists and biologists the world
over have been trying to penetrate the
mystery of this unusual feat. How can
a deer, in the matter of only a few
.months, produce such a large amount of
living bone tissue, which often outweighs
the entire bulk of its own skeleton? It
is truly a mystery, equal to that which
surrounds the migration of certain birds
and ﬁshes, or the smoothly performing
social organizations of the ant or bee.

To the deer the process of growing a
new set of antlers and conditioning them
for future use is a rather tedious as well
as a painful job. During June and July
a stag’s antlers are in the “velvet” stage.
This “velvet” which covers the new
antlers in early season is a real growth
of skin, containing nerves, glands, blood
vessels, and even a light coating of soft
hair. It’s function is primarily to pro—
tect the antlers for they are extremely
soft and tender. Frequently they are in-
jured in the heavy brush and bleed freely.
Nothing excites the deer quite so much
as the sight of blood dripping from his
antlers and he’ll tear about in a frenzy
trying to escape the sight.

The moose, cagey animal that he is,
realizes that he would be no match for
his enemies while in the “velvet” stage.
So he wisely retires to the swamps and
marshy regions quietly biding his time.
But once his antlers have hardened Old
Man Moose emerges and commands a
wide berth—and gets it!

Along about the middle of August the
deer’s antlers begin to harden. Writers
differ on the method the deer uses to
accomplish this. However the antlers are
fairly hard now and the “velvet” begins
to peel off. During this period it is not
unusual to see the bucks rubbing their
horns against the trunks of trees or
heavy shrubbery. The drying seems to
set up an irritation. At the end of about
two weeks the “velvet” is no more, leav-
ing the antlers white and smooth as a
polished tusk.

These glistening white antlers, which
the bucks carry so majestically, are
grown primarily to serve as weapons
during the mating season. This is an im—
portant period in the deer’s life for when
the stag “bells” his challenge from a

lofty outpost and one of his rivals an—
swers from a thicket his life may well
depend upon his set of antlers.

As soon as the pairing season is past
the buck sheds his antlers. This is
brought about by the “corona”—-a ring
of bony tissue near the base of the ant—
lers, which gradually becomes so hard
and dense that it completely shuts off the
ﬂow of blood. Slowly but surely the
antlers die and are shed in much the
same manner as a tree sheds its leaves.

A Haven for the Wild

CALVIN WALKER

HERE are no buildings on the muddy

shores of Goose Pond. And, some-
how, I hope there never will be. It is
only a small body of water, nestled like
an oval mirror in a frame of variegated
forestry. A faint trail, as meandering
as a cow path, connects it with the outside
world. On the fringe of its muddy col-
lar, enormous rocks like tireless sentinels,
ﬂaunt the encroaching timber.

Here, in the quiet of the night, deer
come down to slake their thirst; leaving
in the soft muck, the cloven pressure of
their hoofs. And the red fox, furtive
and cunning, marks his passage with
even, four-toed impressions. There are
others too, that, moving stealthily, come
down from the hills. The wise old raccoon,
with his humanized paws, the lordly
skunk with his curving claws, and the
imperturbable porcupine on his padded,
stubby feet. All of these, and more, fre-

quent the languid waters of Goose Pond.

I suppose the water is very blue there
now. With winter coming on I imagine
it is reﬂecting the rich azure of the sky.
I suppose, too, that it is dotted with the
colorful leaves of the sugar maple—in
death the most beautiful of all foliage.
And there will be somber oak leaves, and
the dull brown of lanceolate elm, and the
serrated darkness of the walnut. And,
less common perhaps, there will be oc-
casional maroon-colored ivy, and sumac
and woodbine. Like tiny sailboats they’ll
be catching every breeze; following it,
running out to leeward.

I don’t know why it is called Goose
Pond; unless, perhaps, at this time of
year, the migrating geese make it a rest-
ing point. Certainly I never saw any
of them; although, in the deep of the
night, I have heard the thrilling honk
of their passage. But I have seen ducks
there, furrowing the water like a minia-
ture ﬂotilla of destroyers; and a crane
in the thin depth at the north end, his
spindled legs seemingly too frail for so
stout a body. I have seen turtles, too,
carrying their ancient armor in slow
progress along the bottom.

Man, on the whole, has been good to
wild life. He has set apart natural sites
for the heritage of the future. Although
Goose Pond is not part of a reservation,
I hope it will never know the bark of a
riﬂe. I hope, when this war is over, men
will set aside the gun; will, like the little
pond in the hills, be an open world to a
peaceful way of life.

A Wise Old Burro

ANNIE KEELER WILLIAMS

THE burro is a very patient animal and wiser than
his appearance would indicate. While living near a
mine my small daughter had an old white burro she used
to ride. But this little burro did not always wish to be
ridden, and so he would not let her get upon his back.
When she set a box beside him and got upon the box
to mount him, he would merely move away. Then he
would stand patiently until she moved the box to a new
place, and again when she was ready to climb upon him
he would move again.

Then the little girl found a way to overcome this
trouble. She would set a bucket with some oats in it in
front of him. When he put his head down into the bucket
to get the oats the little girl would climb upon his neck,
and when he lifted his head to chew the oats she would
slide down upon his back. After he had eaten all the
oats he would then take her anywhere she wished if she

patted him on the side of the neck opposite to the direc-
tlon she wished to go.

If the burro suspected the trick I think he felt repaid
by the feeding" of oats he received.

The Squirrel’s Answer

CHRISTINE PARK HANKINSON

Good morning, Little Squirrel!
My, my! How do you do!
You might stop just a moment
To let me speak to you.
You dart along the tree-trunk,
And drop to earth; and then
You. keep on running races
Up there and back again.
Do tell me, Little Squirrel,
What secrets have you learned?
What is the season’s promise?
Why are you so concerned?
Oh, I can sense your answer—
You “have no time to spare”;
The nuts are ripe for winter
And you must have your share.

Experts in the Insect World

OME of the wasps are paper makers; the spiders are
spinners and the worms are weavers.

The ants are indefatigable workers and have a well
organized system of labor.

Certain spe-
cies of East In-
dian ants are hor-
ticulturists; they
raise mushrooms,
upon which they
feed their young.

The bees are
expert builders;
their cells are so
constructed as,
with the least
quantity of ma-
terial, to have
the largest-sized
rooms and the
least possible loss
of wall spaces.

So also are the
ant-lions, whose
funneLshaped
traps are exactly
correct in confor-
mation, as if they
had been made
b y t h e m o s t
skilled architects
of our species
with the aid of
the best instru-
ments.

She Holds the World’s Record

The world’s record in milk production
is held by “Carnation Ormsby Madcap
Fayne,” a nine-year-old cow of Washing-
ton State. Last year she gave 24 times
her own weight (1,780 pounds) in milk,
or a total of 41,944 pounds. This was an
average of 55 quarts a day, which is more
than nine ordinary cows can produce.

Dehorning Cattle in Scotland

N article in the September issue of

Our Dumb Animals on the dehorn—
ing of cattle has brought to us a very
interesting letter from Scotland upon
this same subject. Mr. Lynde‘say G.
Langwill, Secretary of the Scottish So—
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, Edinburgh, Scotland, writes:

“The operation has been controlled in
this country for many years, as the
Animals (Anaesthetics) Act, 1919, con—
tains a provision which prohibits dehorn—
ing of cattle over one month old unless
during the whole operation the animal
is under the inﬂuence of some general or
local anaesthetic, being in either case of
sufficient power to prevent the animal
feeling pain. A person convicted under
this Act is liable in respect of a ﬁrst
offence to a ﬁne not exceeding £ 5 for
each animal, and in respect of a second
and subsequent offence, to a ﬁne not
exceeding £ 25, or alternatively, or in
addition thereto, to imprisonment for a
period not exceeding three months.

“The Scottish Department of Agricul—
ture also explains the method of prevent-
ing the growth of horns on calves by the
application of caustic potash to the horn—
buds.” _

Once more we must express our hope
that this cruelty involved in dehorning
cattle will be so agitated by the Humane
Societies of this country that ultimate
legislation will go as far as that which
now prevails in Scotland, in spite of the
fact that the numbers of cattle handled
here are so very much higher than in that
country.

Time-Honored Proverbs
T. J. MCINERNEY

HT is difﬁcult to ﬁnd more glowing trib-
utes to animals than those contained
in proverbs. They are to be found not
only in our own language, but in the Dan-
ish, Spanish, Portuguese, Sicilian, Chi—
nese and others. Many of these prover—
bial tributes have come down ' to us
through the centuries.

The appeal of the proverb is its ability
to literally speak volumes in a few words.
A typical example is this time-honored
proverb:

“A man of cruelty is God’s enemy.”

A wide variety of proverbs and axioms
have been written about that most loyal
of dumb creatures, the dog. According to
an old Chinese proverb, “The dog has no
aversion to a poor family,” and we know
that there is no more truthful statement
than that. There is a challenge as well
as a rebuke in this one, from our own
language: ‘ '

“He that strikes my dog would strike
me if he durst.”

The Spaniards of old obviously had
their opinions concerning the proper
feeding of dogs, for we ﬁnd this among
their ancient writings:

“He who has not bread to spare should
not keep a dog.”

Here are some proverbs which perhaps
are the most familiar:

Money cannot buy the wag of a dog’s
tail.

The principal difference between a dog
and a man is that if you pick up a starv-
ing dog and make him prosperous, he Will
not bite you.

A righteous man regardeth the life
of his beast.

The Hummingbird’s Nest
M a b e I M a r k s

Swung low upon a leafy branch
Was hid a small round nest;

In all bird—land it surely was
The very tiniest,

Hatton

We tip-toed for a closer view
And found to our delight

Two little huddled feathery balls,
Nest-colored, brown and white.

Two beaks were gaping wide at us,
Four eyes stared in a trance;

Meal time? We drew away to give
The mother bird a chance.

And soon from cautious perch nearby
She came on whirring wing;

All shimmery gold and green and red,
A lovely gauzy thing.

She fed the babes their fairy food
Impartially, but when

She flew aside to sip her own,
Those beaks gaped wide again.

How the Eagle Became
Symbolic
LAURA ALICE BOYD

FTER the signing of the Declaration

of Independence by the American
Congress in 1776, there was need for a
great seal to use in stamping ofﬁcial state
documents. Three times Congress ap—
pointed committees to choose a design
for such a seal. The ﬁrst committee
consisted of, Doctor Franklin, Mr.
J. Adams and Mr. Jefferson. They could
not agree on a design but each one had a
different plan; Franklin wanted Moses
shown drov'vning Pharoah in the Red Sea;
Jefferson wished to show Moses leading
the Children of Israel through the Wil-
derness, while John Adams wanted Her-
cules between Virtue and Sloth. None of
these plans pleased Congress and the re-
port was “laid on the table.”

A second committee appointed the fol—
lowing year fared no better. In 1780
Francis Hopkinson suggested a design
of 13 stripes and 13 stars with some
allegorical ﬁgures. This met with ap-
proval until the amount of the cost was
discovered and again the idea was
dropped. Two years later another com-
mittee consulted with the artist William
Barton who suggested the crested eagle
as the center ﬁgure in the design. Charles
Thomson, chairman of the congressional
committee, suggested that the American
bald eagle be used but when he read his
report he left out the word “bald.” To
William Barton and to Charles Thomson
must go the credit for the design as it
now stands with the eagle and the motto,
“E Pluribus Unum.”

The Stately Swans Deserve Preservation

 

TRUMPETER SWANS, RED

HOUGH these magniﬁcent birds

II were fairly familiar to our fathers

and grandfathers, our sons are
likely to see a lot less of them if the mor-
tality rate isn’t improved pretty soon.

We are fortunate in having within our
borders two of the largest swans known
—the Trumpeter Swan and the Whistling
Swan. And if any birds deserve preser-
vation, and merit niches in the birds’
these two magniﬁcent
specimens certainly do.

There is an ancient swannery on the
Dorsetshire coast, in England, that is
reputed to be nearly a thousand years
old. And from records compiled there
the big birds have been known to live,
in captivity, for forty, and more, years.

One of the most remarkable things
about swans is the Victorian trait of
cleaving steadfastly to the same mate.
And in all the world there is nothing
more lonely, or pathetic looking, than a
swan that has lost its mate.

When feeding, a swan sometimes
thrusts his long neck deep under the sur-
face and points his tail to the sky. And
when he raises his head the water pours
from the gutters in his bill, conveniently
placed there for that purpose.

The eggs, some half dozen or so in
number, are laid in a nest of weeds two
and a half feet high by some six feet
wide, and are hatched after forty odd
days of devoted setting.

The cygnets, as the ﬁedglings are
called, try desperately to ﬂy, twitching
their absurd little tails and ﬂapping
their baby wings. Maturity comes
slowly, however, as it invariably does to
any attaining long life, and they breed
only in their third and fourth year.

WILLIAM MacMILLAN

 

Fish and Wildlife Service

ROCK LAKES, MONTANA

The Trumpeter Swan (Cygnus bucci—
nator), so—called because its call is sup.-
posed to, more or less, resemble the notes
of a horn, is the larger of the two swans
mentioned and frequently attains a
length of ﬁve and a half feet, a weight
of thirty—ﬁve pounds and a wing spread
of ten feet. His head and neck are
brownish, while the rest of his body is
grayish white. His bill and feet are jet
black and his nostrils about in the middle
of his bill.

For all his imposing carriage and
magniﬁcent proportions some exacting
critics maintain that his forepart lies
too low in the water for him ever to be
awarded the palm for gracefulness.

The Whistling Swan (Cygnus colum-
bianus), is slightly smaller in size than
his trumpeting cousin and is quite read-
ily recognized. His coloring is much the
same but his nostril is nearer his right
eye and, sometimes, there is a small
yellow mark before his eye. Not nearly
as quarrelsome and pugnacious as the
trumpeter he has managed to survive
some devastating experiences.

We are paying for the shortsighted-
ness of our predecessors in many ways.
Let us make sure that these two magniﬁ-
cent swans will be preserved for our
sons’ sons!

What Should We Do
Without Them?

F course, men, women and children

come ﬁrst. The plea of the Red
Cross, the appeal for the starving chil-
dren of China and for suffering human-
ity, come whence they may, are ﬁrst. A
man is better than a sheep. Yet, have
we not also been told that not even a
sparrow falls without His notice?

Animals? We cannot deny their claim
upon us. Have we not made them our
servants from time immemorial? Have
we not forced them into unrequited
labor? Have we not killed them for our
food? Have they not for generations
brought something into our homes of
inestimable value by their companion—
ship, their unfailing ﬁdelity? Do we owe
nothing to the birds whose songs and
plumage are a perpetual joy and without
whom our land would be a barren waste,
ravaged by the world of insect life?

Meet we must the claims upon us of
our humankind in their hours of need,
but shall no sacriﬁce be made by us to
make this world a kindlier world for
beast and bird and those lowly inmates
of our homes who have given us so
much?

Blot out the existence today of all life
below that of our own race, and imagine,
if you can, how this human race—you
and I—would feel, faced by a world
without a living creature except our-
selves. Isn’t here something worth think-
ing about by those who ignore often as
trivial the appeals of our humane organi-
zations for help and the cause we repre-
sent as unworthy of their regard?

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Our Peace Aims

HAT are the peace problems the

world will be confronted with when
this war is over? Is it possible to sign a
peace treaty which will forever ban
wars? We believe it is, provided it is the
will of the American people to do so.

As others have pointed out, it does not
matter much what Roosevelt, Churchill
and Stalin would like to do. The thing
that counts is that the free people of this
world must agree on a just and fair
peace, and then enforce it.

We all know now that the Versailles
Treaty was a ﬁasco. It bred discontent in
Germany, and it produced Hitler. After
the war the sensible people in Germany,
Italy and Japan, who have never quite
accepted Hitler, Mussolini or Hirohito,
must be appealed to. They must be fed
and clothed and educated in our demo-
cratic principles of freedom and peaceful
living.

Woodrow Wilson, a man of letters and
high ideals, visualized such a world in
1918; the shock of losing the peace killed
him. It was of Mr. Wilson that the cele—
brated statesman, General Smuts, said,
“It was not he who failed at Versailles, it
was humanity that failed.” At the end
of the war let us beneﬁt by Wilson’s ex-
perience; let us utilize the brains of our
ﬁnest thinkers, practical people and just
plain, ordinary citizens, and let us then
create a new world of peace — lasting
peace — for our children and the world’s
children to live in, free from fear of
conquest. Such a world can only bring
out the best in the human soul.

Horses’ Christmas

AFTER an absence of more than
twenty years, the faithful, uncom-
plaining work horse has once more
walked into the nation’s busy street
scene. It has not been his fault. War-
time gasoline and tire rationing has
forced industry to place much of the
transportation burden on the horse, and
there are more of them in harness today
than at any time in the past two decades.
At this Christm-astime, all of us can
help show how much we appreciate what
the horse is doing for the national war
effort. Contributions of money or grain,
apples or carrots, sent to the Angel]
Memorial Hospital, 180 Longwood Ave-
nue, Boston, will provide free Christmas
dinners for horses on the streets and in
the stables. Such contributions will be
gratefully acknowledged.

The Society also will provide food for
the birds and squirrels during times of
emergency throughout the winter.

TO give for Humane Education is to

lay the axe at the root of the tree of
cruelty.

A Champion of Our Wild Life

MONG the devoted and untiring

friends of our wild life, particu-
larly of our wild fowl, is Mrs. Rosalie
Edge, Chairman of the Emergency Con-
servation Committee, New York City.
In her last publication she makes a
strenuous plea, not only for all our mi-
gratory birds, but particularly for our
beautiful Wood Duck, “made,” she says,
“tame and conﬁdent by protection for a
period of more than twenty-six years,
and which now may be shot in every
state. Red-Heads and Ruffle-Heads, spe-
cies almost extinct) may also be shot, not
more than one Wood Duck, or more than
three singly in the aggregate of Red—
Heads and Ruffle-Heads.”

“Du-ck hunting privileges will be
greater this year, the Department of the
Interior news release explains, because
of the continuing increase of birds.”

She also further says, “Nor should
ammunition be spent in wartime in the
killing of the remnant of our beautiful
and once abundant waterfowl. Hundreds
of thousands of citizens of this country
would like to see a truce in the destruc-
tion of harmless and beautiful birds and
animals. Millions of our men are at war.
The restriction on gas and tires, the
difﬁculties of travel, and other war re-
strictions, make hunting this year a
dereliction in national duty and a war-
time anomaly.”

The Christmas Puppy

HIS Christmas, boys and girls in

many sections of our land will re-
ceive puppies or kittens as gifts, and
a few weeks later Humane Societies will
get many requests to call at this or that
home to remove the Christmas puppy or
kitten—now perhaps sick or suffering
from a broken leg, or just not wanted
any more.

The above should not be construed to
infer that we object to children’s receiv—
ing animals as gifts; as a matter of fact
we encourage it—but we call attention
to the disappointments and suffering we
often encounter, and urge parents to
make certain that the children are old
enough to assume the responsibility of
caring for a pet and, very importantly,
that a dog or cat is really wanted in the
home.

A speaker was irritated by the noise
made by the assemblage. “Silence!” he
roared. “I want this hall to be so still
you can hear a pin drop.” There was a
deadly quiet for a moment; then an ir-
repressible youth piped up, “Let ’er
dropf’

WHEREVER there is a human being
there is an opportunity for kindness.
SENECA

 




Dec.1942 OUR DUMB ANIMALS

 

Game the May days, came the warblers,
the prairie warbler actually lighting
Within arm’s length upon the roof. The
Maryland yellowthroat peeked up at me
from his low perch in a scrub apple. The
black and whites examined the telephone
pole.

Then with the apple-blossoms, came
the bobolinks making the meadows
round us ripple with song. “Here we
are,” they seemed to announce over and
over again, “here we are, here we are!”
One pair liked us so well, they settled
right down on our hill-top for the entire
season, the male sitting close to the tower
and in half-hour stretches on the tele-
phone-wire perch, made our watch merry
with his jubilant cadences. Somewhere
beneath him in the weeds by the side of
the fence, I knew his nest was hidden;
but such an excellent camouﬂager is the
bobolink that I never found it, though
I often saw the female rise up seemingly
from a certain spot.

Other birds, too, sang for us from
their observation posts. The phoebes,
the king birds, the cat birds, the robins,
the thrashers, the chewinks. Always the
birds to keep us company as we scanned
the skies for planes.

The summer days gone and our old
friends departing, we welcomed Septem-
ber mornings accompanied by the canary
trills of the goldﬁnches, dipping their
sunny selves from thistle tops to milk-
weed. From the tall elms the bluejays
with raucous cries reminded us that
winter days were coming soon.

But we shall not mind, for along with
our Flying Fortresses and Lightnings,
we shall still hear the whir of the wings
of peace,—the chickadees, the juncos and
the tree sparrows. Tapping out their
code, the woodpeckers will watch with us
the snowy skies, while circling high above
us the crows will also vigil keep. Not
“Army Flash” with them—freebooters
of the air, but a crying “caw” that is a
warning to birds of lighter wing.

Yet the greatest thrill of all will come
when at length, the cycle of seasons hav-
ing turned again, we shall one morning
spot in southern sky a V formation mov-
ing north. Their ﬂight high, their wings
strong, their direction sure.

“The wild geese,” we shall cry, “the
wild geese. It’s Spring again and V for
Victory.”

The Sturdy Camel

MABEL IRENE SAVAGE

ID you know that a camel can close
his nostrils tightly or open them
wide at will? During the terriﬁc desert
sand storms of Arabia the camel closes
his nostrils to keep out irritating sand
until the storm is over.
Did you know that camels sometimes
ﬂy into sudden ﬁts of extreme rage? It
is wise not to go too near a camel’s head.

Page 233

 

»§

 

BRIDAL OUTFIT IN PROVINCE OF YAKUTSH, SIBERIA

 

 

Sometimes, for no visible reason at all,
camels become so angry they try to bite
and kick the person nearest.

Did you know that an adult camel can
carry 500 to 600 pounds of commercial
goods for hundreds of miles across bar-
ren, sun-scorched deserts? About 25
miles a day is the limit for baggage
camels, but riding camels, with only a
light pack and rider, can cover up to 80
miles of desert country in ten hours.
Starting their third year, camels will
carry heavy loads for ﬁfteen to twenty
years, and are able to do light work
until thirty years old or more. Some
live to be 50 years old.

Did you know that, given a handful of
dry beans or hard dates after a hard
day’s journey, the camel can fare very
well? For his required green roughage
he crops twigs, thistles and thorny shrubs
that grow here and there in the desert.
He can actually go a whole week without
a drink of water because his stomach is
a honeycomb of tiny cells that hold the
moisture, allowing it to be released as
needed by the camel’s body.

Did you know that riding the camel—
“Ship of the Desert”—will make you
seasick? This is because he lifts both
feet on one side at the same time, tilting
his body sideways. To ride properly you
must allow your body to roll over and
back. Tossing and pitching, heaving and
rolling, you might feel that you were in
a sailboat on a rough sea.

Did you know that there are no rec-
ords of wild camels? In the Bible we
read that Abraham took on his journey
“sheep and oxen and camels.” Job had
at one time six thousand camels, and the
Amalekites possessed “camels without
number.”

Did you know that in 1857 the United
States tried to introduce the camel into
Arizona and New Mexico?

The Ways of the Ant

ALDEN MANN

STUDENT of ants recently told of
his discovery that ants are good
ﬁre-ﬁghters.

“You have, no doubt,” he said, “stepped
into an anthill and been amused to see
the sentinel ants quickly rush out and
then as quickly disappear to spread the
alarm. A moment later, perhaps, you
saw work-gangs being formed and put
to the work of rebuilding. In addition
to these things, I have also observed ants
when ﬁre threatened them.

“I have thrown a lighted match in their
anthill, and soon it would be encircled by
a ring of ants. As some of the ants
became exhausted, others quickly took
their places. The ﬁre gradually went out.
I was curious to know why, and after
close observation discovered that the
little creatures are equipped to throw a
tiny stream of formic acid.

“Not all ants are tiny, however,” this
student of ants reminded me. “There
are portions of the South American
jungle where the ants are of gigantic size
and so ferocious that they are feared by
man and beast. Veteran explorers have
told me that they will take their chances
with the boas, the anacondas, the jaguars,
the crocodiles, and any other wild beast,
but not with the ants.

“Travelers, caught in the jungles, have
been found with only their white bones
remaining to tell the story of their futile
struggle.”

“Remember the Biblical quotation: ‘Go
to the ant thou sluggard; consider her
ways and be wise?’ Ways of industry,
intelligence, courage, thrift, and many
more. ‘Busy as ants’ has become a symbol
of industriousness the world over. Yes,
one may well heed the Biblical words and
consider the ways of the ants.

Ralph Waldo Emerson

Butterﬂy “Air” Invasion
E. R. YARHAM, F.R.G.S.

EGULARLY every year Britain is
“invaded by air.” Dr. C. Williams,
a noted entomologist, after a long period
of patient study, has found that no fewer
than a dozen species of butterﬂies which
adorn that country’s gardens and coun—
tryside come from overseas. Indeed, for
their size they undertake journeys just as
remarkable as the migratory ﬂights of
birds. Butterﬂies reaching Britain must
be regarded as some of the most notable
travelers in the world of Nature, for not
even the barriers of the English Channel,
the North Sea—and, most astonishing of
all—the Atlantic, can stop them.

Although these fragile creatures weigh
a mere inﬁnitesimal fraction of an ounce,
they battle with tempestuous winds and
succeed in crossing hundreds of miles of
ocean. Some reach Britain from Africa
and countries of the Eastern Mediter-
ranean. These are Painted Ladies, and
some of the same species ﬂy on to the
far north, to Iceland; the Camberwell
Beauty crosses the North Sea from
Scandinavia, a journey of 600 or 700
miles with no possible chance of a resting
place enroute; while now and again the
American Monarch, or milkweed butter-
ﬂy, aided by prevailing westerly winds,
occasionally accomplishes the most amaz-
ing migration of all—the passage of the
Atlantic.

Others which in similar fashion cross
the seas from the Continent bear equally
picturesque names, among them being
the red admiral and clouded yellow. These
frail insects keep up the remarkable ﬂy-
ing speed of about 15 miles per hour for
long periods on end, and how they man-
age to do this and at the same time keep
on a fairly regular course are mysteries
naturalists have not yet solved.

The motive which drives the insects to
cross seas beset with peril on every hand
1s not yet fully understood. At ﬁrst it
was believed the quest for food was the
reason, but this cannot be so, for food is
as abundant south of the Channel as in
Britain. Some students of the problem
put the movements down as an instinct
which has been handed down for thou—
sands of years from a time when the
climate of the Northern Hemisphere was

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

far different from What it is now. Then
most probably Southern Europe and
North Africa were subjected to great
heat during the summer, and all vegeta-
tion was parched, so that the insects ﬂew
north to cooler regions, and now, in spite
of the fact that the climate has moder—
ated, the ingrained habit persists.

At times, even when conditions are
fair, large numbers must perish from
exhaustion in the ocean unless they have
the ability to ﬂy much farther without a
rest than has up till now been thought
possible. Specimens of the American
Monarch have been sighted 250 miles out
in the Atlantic and ﬂying strongly.

The distance into the Atlantic men-
tioned with regard to the American
Monarch is by no means a record, for
butterﬂies have been sighted over the
ocean a thousand miles from the coast
of Africa. On his South American
voyage Darwin recorded that large num-
bers of butterﬂies were seen heading
directly to sea.

Golden-Crowned Kinglet

CHARLES P. ISLEY

MONG the friendliest of the wild
birds is the golden-crowned kinglet.
He is a tiny fellow, his length being four
and one-half inches, but his size in no
way hinders his bravado. One can walk
within a few feet of him and he is not
alarmed. It is this fearless-
ness that makes him popular
among bird lovers. A favorite
habit is to ﬂit from bush to
bush a few feet ahead of the
woodland hiker, turning his
head in curiosity and twitch—
ing his perky tail. He ranks
with the chickadees as a tra-
peze artist, his gay antics por—
traying his high spirits.
The orange and yellow
crown of the male is bordered
with black, while the crown of
the female is merely a patch
of yellow. The bodies of both
birds are olive green. Golden-
crown favors the cone-bearing
trees and his cylindrical nest
of moss and feathers is usu-
ally found suspended from the
topmost branches of pines and
cedars. The nest is neatly
hollowed out to hold from six
to nine creamy white eggs
which are speckled with nu—
merous minute brown spots.
He is not a winter resident
of the Northern United States,
although he frequently re-
mains throughout the year.
The wintry blasts do not seem
to bother him, for when we
humans are bundled in over-
coats and mufﬂers, he hops
merrily about in his quest for

food. He frequents the small shrubs
along the hillsides of the marshes and
ravines, where hehunts busily among
the branches for cocoons and hibernat—
ing insects which form the bulk of his
winter diet. He is a close associate of
the downy woodpeckers, creepers, nut—
hatches and chickadees.

As the bird ﬂies about he often utters
a high “ti-ti” which is not easily heard.
In its summer home it voice-s a lisping
warble of ﬁve or six shrill high-pitched,
faltering notes in quick succession and
ends with a short explosive warble.

Though his song doe-s not compare with
that of many of his feathered com—
patriots, his friendly manner more than
compensates for his lack of musical
ability. One is almost Certain to en-
counter him on an early spring outing
when the winds are still cold and few
birds have ventured northward.

Marionette Shows

“Peter Rabbit,” a marionette show,
was recently presented by Mrs. Thomas
G. Vail at the Simsbury, Connecticut,
Free Library, and sponsored by the Con—
necticut Humane Society. Many books
about animals were circulated on this
occasion. Last year over 150 children
saw the marionette play “Johnny Goes
to Court.” These plays were greatly en-
joyed by the boys and girls.

JOAN HALLIGAN, OF BROOKLINE,
BIG DOLL FROM THE S. P. C. A. FOR SAVING HER
CAT’S LIFE IN A FIRE.

MASS, RECEIVES

 

Blue Jay Makes Fine Pet

MARISE FAWSETT

HAVE you ever seen a pet blue jay — what’s more,

a blue jay that has the run of its owner’s house,
like a dog or a cat?

Little Diane Hilliard of Sandwich, Massachusetts,
has such a remarkable companion. When the bird ﬂut-
tered and fell out of its nest before it was quite
old enough to ﬂy, Diane’s parents took care of it
and raised it in their home. It sleeps in an open
basket in the living room, and when it isn’t resting
on the back of a chair, or gossiping with the para-
keets whose cage stands in a corner, it ﬂies into
the kitchen to see what Mrs. Hilliard is cooking,
or swoops upstairs to see what is going on there.
Sometimes it goes outdoors and plays among the
treetops, or hunts for insects in the grass. But
always it comes back to the door and asks to be
let in again.

“Jay” must have a variety of foods. Though
he likes such things as grain and lettuce leaves,
he wants a little of everything else in the house
too, and a portion of the table scraps must there-
fore go to him. Being a member of the crow fam-
ily, he is quite mischievous. If Mrs. Hilliard leaves

  

 

 

 

A Christmas Legend
Katherine Simons

In a far off country, where the snow is deep,
The little Christ Child wanders while other children sleep.

On Christmas Eve He wanders nightlong, beneath His load
Of fir or ash or holly, by hedge and field and road.

In every cottage window a candle flickers gay
That night. The children set them to guide Him on His way.

And, if those candles beckon the lost or old or poor
Or sick, a welcome waits them at every cottage door.

For they who love the Christ Child have learned that mortal eyes
May sometimes fail to find Him in poverty’s disguise.

 

her sewing basket open, she is pretty sure to miss a
button or a skein of thread, and later ﬁnd it carefully
hidden behind the clock, or beneath the leaves of one
of her potted plants.

In addition to Diane and the parakeets, Jay has
another companion, “Penny,” the Hilliard’s little Bos-
ton bull, who was taught from the start not to harm the
ﬂedgling. Now that Jay has grown up, he has the
upper hand in the situation, sometimes alighting on
Penny’s unprotesting back and riding there for a min-
ute, and sometimes using Penny’s drinking bowl for a
bird bath.

Jay is a remarkable pet, and proves that birds are
not only beautiful, but more intelligent and responsive
than many people realize.

A little Chinese girl was carrying a chubby boy on
her back.

“Is he heavy?” someone asked.

“No,” was the reply; “he is my brother.”

Little Furry Things

Rose Leary Love

Pity the little furry things that run upon the
snow,

Leaving fairy footprints as scampering on
they go.

Their ears a-tingle with the noise of the
hunter’s deadly gun,

They stop a while to listen: then on they
wildly run.

Seeking any shelter from the ruthless hand
of man,

Who pursues them with a vengeance as hard
as e’er he can.

Pity the little furry things whose bodies
racked with pain

Pausing for an instant to catch their breath
again.

But lo, the hunter sees their forms, his gun
hascaughttheronge

And the weary little furry things will never
rke agahL

Their wild eyes vainly look around as they
struggle hard to rise,

But soon their tired bodies will lie still
beneath the skies.

0 little velvet furry things, you did not
die alone,

For a Great Heart listened from above to
thy last expiring groan.

Somehow I think that he is glad that once
more you can rest

Beneath the mantle of the snow and against
the warm earth's breast.

Friendly Cottontails
GLADYS JORDAN

F all our American mammals there

are few, if any, better known and

loved than dear old, “Brer Rabbit,” our

friendly cottontail. In folklore, in litera-

ture, and in the hearts of the children,
he has a deﬁnite place of his own.

Having characteristics of both the
hares and the rabbits the cottontails have
certain distinctive differences. They are
smaller than most American hares and
they are far more plentiful. Their ﬂuffy,
cottony white tails are quite positively
their own. No other rabbit can even ob-
tain a copy. From the Atlantic to the
Paciﬁc, from the Canadian border
through the Argentina they do a hop,
skip and jump, their white ﬂag identify-
ing them everywhere. On the heights
and on the low-lands they are equally at
home. They take life as they ﬁnd it and
seem to ﬁnd joy in living.

Yet, common as they are, they know
quite well how to conceal themselves and
their homes. Often they make “forms,”
in the thickets or in the dense grass.
Lacking this natural cover, they burrow
into the ground where they take refuge
from their enemies when closely pursued.
In this respect they differ from their
cousins, the hares, who seek safety in
ﬂight and scorn all burrows, depending

OUR

DUMB ANIMALS

Nov. 1942

 

LARGE EARS DETECT EVERY THREATENING SOUND

solely upon their remarkable speed and
zigzag course when followed by dogs or
other enemies.

Blackouts hold no fear for the cotton-
tails. Rather, they wait for the night,
when they come out into the open and
gather lush salad greens for supper and
gambol on the green or chase each other
over the dark, friendly earth. They seem
to love the moonlight and the shadows.
And often they would pass unnoticed
were it not for the cottonball tail that
bobs up and down like a rubber ball on the
crest of a wave. I’ve seen them on the
edge of the forest, along a country road,
in the glare of an auto-light and felt a
quick desire to pick them up and carry
them away for playmates.

If you are fortunate enough to ﬁnd
a cottontail nest you will ﬁnd an artist’s
labor of love. If above ground, it will
be in a slight hollow, and made of dried
grasses. Then from her own body the
mother rabbit has pulled the softest of
fur and carefully lined the babies’ nest.
After ﬁnishing it to her satisfaction she
skillfully conceals it by covering it with
more dead grass and leaves.

Several litters appear during the early
spring months. The tiny babies are blind
and helpless, whereas their cousins, the
hares, are wide-eyed and fully clad when
they come into the world.

In some places the cottontails are pro-
tected by law as are game animals. Cer-
tainly they provided food for our early
settlers when starvation was close at
hand, and many a wanderer, lost in the
woods, has owed his life to the humble
rabbit. But to many of us they are as
distinctive as their name. They are sym-
bolic of joy and beauty and freedom and,
as Lincoln once said of the common
people, “God must have loved them to
have made so many of them.”

Animals’ Ears

HEN you see a rabbit running, no-

tice its ears, and you will see that
they are laid back ﬂat on its neck. This is
not a chance position, nor is it due to the
weight of the ears; it is a provision of
nature for the little animal’s protection.
It is one of the hunted, you see, and not
one of the hunters.

It is diﬁerent with the fox and the
wolf; their ears, as they run, are thrust
sharply forward, for they are of the
hunters. As the rabbit must run away
to escape danger, its enemies are always
behind it, and, therefore, nature has
given it large ears to catch every sound
and the habit of throwing them back,
because its danger comes from that di-
rection. As the fox and the wolf must
run after their prey, nature has given
them the habit of thrusting their ears
forward.

Just how careful nature is in these
matters, and how she suits conditions to
surroundings, may be seen in the jack-
rabbit of the Western prairies. It is the
natural prey of the wolf, and, as it is in
more danger than our rabbits are, its ears
have been made a good deal larger and
longer, the better to hear the sounds
made by its enemy.

You have seen a horse thrust his ears
forward quickly when anything startles
him; that is his instinctive movement to
catch every threatening sound.

How wisely the Creator has adapted
each animal’s body to the kind of life it
is to live!

“Whatsoever of joy or sorrow thou
sowest in the heart of any creature, that
shalt thou reap in thine own heart.”

First Christmas

Margaret Griffin

The night was soft, was silent,
The Babe lay on the straw,

But only beasts of burden
Around Him there He saw.

A footfall broke the stillness,
The ox stirred in alarm,

But only a shepherd entered,
A lambkin on his arm.

Tyrrell

Revelers were shouting
Inside the noisy Inn,

And all the world was suffering
From sorrow and from sin.

And some there were lay weeping,
That midnight long ago;

Some whose hearts were heavy
With burdens and with woe.

And all the world was waiting
That which was foretold:

The Promise, the Messiah
Of the prophecy of old.

Within the cave at Bethlehem
The Babe lay on the straw,

But only beasts of burden
Around Him there He saw.

Reindeer in Alaska

M. TRENT

UREST—FOOTED beast in the Arctic,
the Alaskan reindeer hauls sledges
through the streets of Nome and other
northern cities with all the deliberation
of a tomcat crossing the alley fence.
These animals haven’t been known to slip
since their hooves are armed with wire
sharp edges—Nature’s own hobnails.

The photograph shows the U. S. mail
drivers changing animals on their
sledges so that the mail may go through.
In the background a group of children
are watching the cameraman.

Reindeer have been domesticated for
centuries, but it is only within the last
few decades that they have been intro-
duced to Alaska. In 1892 Dr. Sheldon
Jackson, then Education Commissioner to
the peninsula territory, decided that rein—
deer imported from Siberia could alter
the whole economic outlook of the pov-
erty-stricken natives. He was right.
Within a few years the increase of the
herds brought pro'sperity to the Eskimos
who had previously been starving, im—
poverished folks.

round us, not one, excepting the dog, has

TYPICAL SANTA CLAUS TURNOUT

“Now, Dasher; now, Dancer; now, Prancer
and Vixen:
On Comet, on Cupid, on Donder and
Blitzen!"
Moore

HEN Clement Clark Moore
Wpenned the lines of his famed “A

Visit from St. Nicholas,” he not
only did the world a great favor by nam—
ing the reindeers of the jolly old Saint,
but down the years (more than one
hundred, in fact), this most favored
of yuletide poems has ever reminded its
readers. that “without the services of
prancing hoofs” Santa Claus might never
reach a single, down-the-chimney, des-
tination.

With this ﬁgurative example of the
important place our four-footed friends
hold in the holiday program, let us cite
more realistic instances of such im-
portance.

Animals have ever been linked very
signiﬁcantly with the sacred setting of
that memorable Christmas Eve, centuries
ago, when—“As shepherds watched their
ﬂocks by night” —— was heralded from
heaven the most holy Birth-Announce-
ment the world has ever received.

In song, in story, and in art such a
setting has been given majestic treat-
ment, and animal life has been highly
exalted by being included in further
outpourings of the three arts, as they
(the arts) deal with the action of that
historic hour.

With the Holy Child “cradled where
the cattle fed,” the cattle necessarily ﬁt
into the sublime scene of the Nativity
and many quaint legends concerning the
keen perception of these animals have
come down to us; such as, “kneeling in
adoration,” before the Christ Child.
Again, in “The Legend of the Friendly
Beasts” (a carol-form that dates back to
the twelfth century), the donkey, the
cow and the sheep are given powers of
human expression, in order to voice
praise, as well as speak of their indi-
vidual deeds of service — the donkey
carrying the. Mother to Bethlehem; the

cow giving up its hay for a pillow for
the Child, and the sheep supplying the
wool for a blanket warm.

The faithful camels that brought the
star-led Wise Men to Bethlehem have
also been the subject of various legends,
none more beautiful than one of French
origin, which tells of a custom started
long ago, when children placed their
shoes, ﬁlled with grain, on the doorsteps
for these camels of the Magi, that the
untiring animals might eat on their
journey through the J udean country.

The Prince of Peace was born of the
royal‘house of David, and in Biblical
heraldry the device belonging to The
Christ is a lion —— He is the Lion of
Judah; and as we celebrate the birthday
of this great Creator of Christmas, whose
most glorious contribution to every liv-
ing creature was His boundless love, may
we, in turn, be generous in our human
contribution of kindness to our dumb
animal friends.

The First Tank

The “ancestor” of those scientiﬁc
marvels, the tanks, which both Allied
Nations and Axis Powers are using in
great numbers in the present war, was
the Hindu war elephant. The huge ani-
mal was used in similar capacity hun-
dreds of years ago. Its force was used
against infantry in exactly the same
manner as the modern tank—the idea
being to crush down footmen and afford
soldiers housed upon its back an oppor-
tunity to slay without being slain.

The Tartars in the wars against the
tribes of India ﬁrst met this astonishing
sight, and their terror was much like
that displayed by the German guards-
men when the tanks appeared at Cam-
brai. The ancient Tartar Emperor
Kublai Khan wrote that his infantry and
cavalry took fright when these elephants,
mounted by archers in boxes, attacked.

in our cities today than the cats that

have been shamelessly abandoned by
thoughtless owners. In order to sustain
mere existence they wander hopefully
and fearfully through alleys and back-
yards. Laws of sanitation make airtight
garbage cans imperative yet these waifs
have no other means of sustenance un-
less humane individuals volunteer a
handout, and they are comparatively
few. During the severe, cold winter
months when the bare streets are even
devoid of shelter, it is pitiful to see their
shadowy forms, stiff with cold, skulking
miserably here and there. A prolonged
period on the street and in byways makes
it difﬁcult to approach these frightened
creatures for their contact with human-
kind has not been such as to inspire
conﬁdence. Sometimes it takes inﬁnite
patience and time to make friendly over-
tures. These conditions are shameful in
a civilized community and particularly
in a country as rich and plentiful as our
own. It is our duty to accord these
neglected outcasts plain justice.

than any other pet when properly housed
and cared for, is the oldest domesticated
animal in existence. Moreover, it is
exceedingly smart and possesses excep-
tional psychic intelligence. None more
so than the common alley feline which
responds remarkably to kindness if it has
not been abused.

Tracing its lineage to the days of the
Egyptians by whom the cat was held in
high esteem because of its superior pow-
ers and aristocratic tendencies, it dwelt

T HERE is nothing more distressing

in those days in the lap of luxury and
contentment. It still retains that in-
herent love for comfort so commonly
known today.

At these times we are reminded of
Alexander Von Humboldt’s words when
he said, “cruelty to animals is one of the
most signiﬁcant vices of a low and ig-
noble people. Wherever one notices them,
they constitute a sure sign of ignorance
and brutality which cannot be painted
over, even by all the evidences of wealth
and luxury. Cruelty to animals cannot
exist together with true education and
true learning.”

It is believed that Italy was the ﬁrst
to transport our furry friends from
Egypt and in turn introduce them to
Britain, and eventually to other parts of
the world. Some years ago Rome turned
one of its huge parks into a “sanctuary”
for stray cats where they were cared for
under human guardianship. It would be
only decently human to adopt this plan
in all communities since there seems to
be no other legitimate solution to the
problem.

Before the war many European ports
maintained large armies of cats in order
to protect their grains. Well fed and
cared for by people employed for that
purpose alone, the authorities discovered
that cats are better “ratters” under the
most favorable conditions.

Although our Humane Societies take
care of proliﬁc numbers that trail our
thoroughfares summer and winter, many
do actually perish from starvation and
cruel neglect. This situation should have
the kindly thought of every individual.

Poor Puss
Cleo Sibley

Pnor Puss has a cold—she feels weary
and old!

She whistles and wheezes; she coughs
and she sneezes—

Puss has a cold.

Where did she get it?

Was it out in the grass where the dragonflies
pass—

Is that where she met it?

Or did a bug bite her, distress and excite her,

Or a plague-harried rat with a temperature
high

Cough in her face as he scurried by?

Is that what begat it? Oh, how we regret it.

For the sun will not shine on the garden
the same,

The flowering vine will lose its bright flame,

And the house will be haunted—her small
ghost will hover,

Lonesome and daunted, if Puss doesn't
recover.

So a hanky for'Puss to wipe her sore nose on,

A blanket for Puss and a pad to repose on.

To quiet her shiver, some hot broth to sup

And a little chopped liver to keep her
strength up

For Puss has a cold—she feels weary and old!

Lumber Camp Cats Fare Well

FERN BERRY

HE common house cat is a mighty

useful member of society if treated
right and kept in its place. And one of
the places where Tabby is most useful is
around the big lumber camps in the
North country. In Upper Michigan’s
forested areas, where the lumbering in-
dustry is now at its height, a number
of well-fed cats are considered necessary
to keep the rats and mice down. Rats
are attracted to the woods’ camp-s by the
quantities of grain kept for the horses
and by the garbage to which they can
gain easy access. Mice, likewise, ﬁnd
the camps a paradise and without the
cats would increase beyond all bounds.

So the cooks and camp managers look
upon the cats as almost a part of the
large crews necessary to keep the job
running smoothly.

Not pampered but well fed and housed
in the barns and shanties, the cats grow
sleek and fat and have thick coats of fur
against the severe weather of the North-
ern Michigan winters. Although located
in the depths of the forests, these cats
don’t do much prowling around and
catching birds and game, for they are
too well fed. A good lumberman will
never abandon his cats when the job is
ﬁnished, leaving them to hunt and be-
come wild cats, a menace to game and
birds. . .

No man is free while one for freedom
yearns. John Drinkwater

1. Question: I wish to purchase a
puppy for a Christmas present for a
friend. Where would I be able to buy a
healthy dog?

Answer: Extreme care should be used
in selecting a puppy from a pet shop or
from a roadside kennel These dogs are
Often infested with worms or sick with
distemper, and the new owner starts with
an ill animal in place of the desirable
healthy specimen. The American Kennel
Club, 221 Fourth Ave., New York City,
will furnish a list of approved kennels
in the vicinity selling registered dogs;
this would be the most satisfactory
method of choosing a dealer to assure a
dog which has the proper start and care
in life. The pet shop puppies Often ap-
peal to one’ s sentimental nature as they
seem so attractive as we watch them
through the store Windows. However,
the healthiest specimens are not found
in such displays.

2. Question: Recently we have ob-
served some small white worms crawling
away from our dog. He has considerable
irritation of the skin and often drags
himself along the ﬂoor, especially follow-
ing a bowel movement. In his bed I ﬁnd
some dry particles resembling seeds.
Would it be advisable to Obtain some
worm medicine and treat him myself?

Answer: Your dog is suffering from
tapeworms. The small white worms ob—
serve-d are merely segments of a very
long worm, and the seed-like particles
are dried segments. These worms Often
cause considerable irritation and inter-
fere with the utilization of food by the
dog. The worm medicines sold in the
stores are not reliable, and it would be
best to consult a veterinarian regarding
treatment.

3. Question: We have a spayed
cocker spaniel, ﬁve years old, which has
recently had difficulty in controlling her
urine. It will ﬂow from her involun-
tarily, and while she sleeps she often
wets her bed. She is in perfect health
otherwise, and we would like to know if
any treatment is possible, as it is be-
coming difﬁcult to have her in the house.

Answer: The difﬁculty you describe is
frequently seen in spayed dogs. It can
be treated by means of hormones — a
relatively new treatment which has
proved very satisfactory. It would be
necessary to consult your veterinarian,
have him examine the animal, and regu—
late the treatment tO the individual
needs.

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Try Nature’s Therapy

KENNETH D. MORRISON

ECAUSE modern life is a complex

of nerve-straining duties, increas-

ingly great numbers of Americans
are ﬁnding relaxation and peace out
under the open sky.

When war news and crime waves vie
for the headlines, it is a good time to
stroll along the seashore and lose your
troubled thoughts in the sometimes gay
and sometimes mufﬂed cadences of the
rolling surf.

If the sea is not handy, go into the
woods. Look up through the oaks or
pines or birches to the sky. Watch the
hawk as it spirals down heaven’s stair-
way. Or try to fathom the inscrutable

stare of an owl as it strives to be philo- ,

sophical about your intrusion into its
haunting grounds. It will not be long
’till the blues that infested your thoughts
have merged with the spacious realm of
blue that swallowed up the hawk.

But one need not walk with head up-
turned. The scolding of chipmunks and
the nasal 'bark of pheasants is enough to
divert the attention. Nature’s pageant
is a continuous performance. In the sky,
on land or water, the curtain never closes.
Although the show is free, not everyone
sees it. Only those with restive eyes and
a keen curiosity are privileged to View
the full spectacle. The unfortunates who
cannot call the actors by at least their
last names miss much of the thrill of the
scenes. There is intense satisfaction in
being certain that it is a cormorant head-
ing into the sunset rather than just a
bird.

Find a creek in the woods, if you can.
Just as men like to build their summer
homes near lakes or rivers, the birds and
animals are always more abundant near
water. Watch the kingﬁsher ply his pros-
perous minnow trade up one bank of the
stream and down the other. Nearby
there may be an osprey overlord, disdain-
ful of the prey that so completely satisﬁes
the kingﬁsher. Possibly your creek will
have beaver tenants or perhaps a porcu-
pine will come down to drink.

Surely you won’t be able to worry
about priorities and income taxes when
a song sparrow is serenading you from
his concert perch atop a thicket and the
black-masked little yellow-throat is frisk-
ing about in the underbrush. There is no
trickery in nature’s magic, no wax faces
or make-up. Sometimes there is tragedy,
sometimes gaiety. Do not stir your emo-
tlons to pass judgment on the actors . . .

Early spring is the best time to follow
the open road. The migrating birds seem
to lend strength to the resolve to see
nature in many settings. The pace is
quickened and the blood tingles. We be-
come vividly aware that life is pulsating
back into the earth below and the trees

above us. It is written in the creamy
beauty of the dogwood that rises from
the frosty ground to look Without a
blush upon the bare woodlands nearby.
A bluebird, whose back imitates the
glory of the heavens and whose breast
is the reﬂection of the1 good earth under-
foot, comes ﬂutteringV‘baﬂck from the
southland, so excited by the privilege of
being the harbinger of what is to come
that it [can only utter feeble snatches of
melody. But those shy notes are like a
symphony to ears that through a long
winter have wearied of the raucous
scream of the jays.

Yes, spring is the time to let nature
start her therapy. In summer the spirit
is willing but the inertia is great. When
the sun slowly starts unraveling winter’s
blanket of snow, it is especially satisfying
to leave the strident noises of the city
behind. Make a resolution that you will
not be merely a hiker but an amateur
ornithologist, entomologist or perhaps a
my-cologist. Nature reserves her most
effective therapy for those who seek to
know her well. Every sprig of foliage
is a “frontier” to him who pursues the
elusive warbler or who yearns to call the
trees by their ﬁrst names.

Befriend'ed
F. J . Wo r r all

Defected he came to my window-sill,
Timid and thin and old;

Every step cautious and consummate skill
Vied with hunger and cold.

Each day he grew bolder and stronger with
care -
And a little more trusting, I think —
His ration of food is always placed there
And plenty of warm milk to drink.

His fur is softer and thicker today
,And his eyes are no longer afraid —

He now has a friend and it’s needless to say
That friend feels amply repaid!

 

If we thought it would do any good,
many of us would run some such want ad
as this in tomorrow’s paper: Wanted—A
refreshed perspective, renewed energy
and a zest for work; a respite from
everyday problems and worries.

We would be astonished to get sugges-
tions from many enthusiastic men and
women who can truthfully say, “I have
foundvmy ‘second wind’ out under the
open sky, away from the turmoil of cities.
Nature offers the degree of Doctor of
Contentment to those who will pause
long enough to study her ways. Why
don’t you try Nature’s therapy?”

“HIS MAJESTY,” THE HORSE

 




 

Dec. 1942

The Real”, Teddy Bear
H. LEWfS CLARK

HE real Teddy Bear is a native of

the “Land Down Under”—Australia.
It is called the koala, and is a friendly,
lovable animal with ash-gray fur; a
quaint snulb nose and no tail. They are
shy and yet they are trusting little things
and if you should take one in your arms
it would cling to you.

At one time there were millions of
koalas in Australia; then “civilized” man
landed on the island and the natives were
driven out of their bush (that is what
the country settlements in Australia are
called), thousands of the majestic euca—
lyptus trees were cut down, hunting dogs
and guns were taken in and the defense—
less, cuddly little animals clinging des—
perately to their beloved trees were
doomed.

Thousands of them fell before the riﬂe
of the hunters. Then the fur trappers
heard of the beautiful fur of the koala
and they arrived on the island and went
to work, with the result that three mil-
lion koalas were killed in one state in
one year and the soft ash-gray fur skins
were sent to Paris, London and America
to be used in the manufacture of fur-
trimmed clothing.

In time it became evident that the little
native bears were doomed to extinction;
then a young man who was fond of ani-
mals in general and of koalas in particu—
lar was seized with the idea of trying to
save them. .

This young man did not have much
money but he secured a few acres of land
not far from Sydney which he converted
into a park, planting the variety of
eucalyptus trees best suited as food for
the animals and with four little bears
began his attempt to raise them.

He cared for them carefully, having
shelter for the winter, and in the course
of time their number increased and he
ﬁnally had the satisfaction of knowing
that he would be able to preserve to the
world one of its most interesting and
attractive of animals.

It took inﬁnite care and patience, for,
unlike most animals, they have very
delicate digestive organs and can digest
nothing except the leaves of only a few
of the many varieties of the eucalyptus
tree. They love chocolate, cake, tea and
milk but will not live long on such a diet.

Another strange thing is that they
never drink water; if it is given to them
they try to chew it, so they have to be
taught to swallow.

These little bears live in the trees and
caper from limb to limb, in case they
are moving from right to left or vice-
versa, but they will not jump either up
or down. They climb slowly and care-
fully.

Sometimes they descend to the ground
at night in search of roots, but, strange

as it may seem, they are afraid of the
ground and of the high winds which
sometimes blow them out of their trees.
They are afraid of falling and yet they
seldom do.

They are very unhappy on the ground,
this young man observed, and if they
encounter a stick or even a twig they
will lie down and wrap themselves around
it, perhaps with the hope that it will lift
them up in the trees again.

Thanks to the Prairie Dogs
BONNIE DEANE VAUGHN

URING the early settlement of

Western Kansas it was noticed that
the prairie dogs, cousins to the New
England woodchuck, in digging their
holes, were bringing up what appeared
to be parched corn.

Since these animals were not in the
habit of storing corn and certainly had
no means of parching it, the settlers
were greatly mystiﬁed. Accordingly,
they began digging into a low rounded
mound covered with buffalo grass and
before long realize-d that they were un-
covering some kind of ruins.

Later, when a geologist from the State
University had taken charge of the ex—
cavation, many interesting things came
to light. A pueblo of seven large rooms
was now revealed, entrance to which had
evidently 'been made through the roof by
ladders. Within the rooms was a consid-
erable amount of parched corn. Toma-
hawks too, were found, as well as ham-
mers, arrow points, sewing needles and
awls of bone, scrapers, grinders, and an
odd musical instrument like the ﬂute,
made from the wing bone of a large bird.
Pottery, coiled and smooth, was among
the relics. The food of the ancient in-
habitants was clearly indicated by the
bones of the buffalo, deer, antelope,
coyote, badger, and other animals.

This pueblo, it was later decided, had
been established by the Picurie Indians
from the Taos section of New Mexico
about 1650. These Christian Indians,
becoming dissatisﬁed with Spanish rule,
had set out to the northeast to establish
a new home. After traveling many long
miles, much of it across ﬂat sun-baked
prairie, they passed among rocky cliffs
and found this fertile little valley.

And very attractive it must have
seemed to the weary wanderers, with its
springs of good water and its creek
abounding in ﬁsh and beaver. The chalky
clay soil was well suited for making
pottery and adobe, while the willows and
coarse grasses growing nearby could be
woven into useful articles by nimble
ﬁngers. They built their pueblo and at
once set about constructing ditches to
irrigate their crops. Ditches which were
used by the white settlers for many years
afterward, some of which are still in use.

The Picuries were happy in their new
location, but later they were persuaded
to return to their former home. For a
time E1 Quartelejo, as this settlement
was called, was used as a Spanish for—
tress. Later, in 1727, it came into the
hands of the French.

Had it not been for the industrious
little prairie dogs this most important
historical location, the farthest east of
the pueblo dwellings and the scene of the
ﬁrst habitation of white men in Kansas,
might never have been revealed.

IN THE EDITOR’S LIBRARY

 

ANGEL IN TOP HAT, Zulma Steele.

At last a brilliant biography of Henry
Bergh, founder of the humane movement in
America, has been written. Miss Steele has
apparently had access to many of Bergh’s
records, as she is able to give the reader a
complete insight into the rather complex
Bergh personality, and she does it with
wit, charm and obvious sympathy.

Bergh’s early life, his travels in Europe
and his ofﬁcial duties as secretary to the
American Embassy in St. Petersburgh, re-
ﬂect the great vision to come. His struggles
in New York City, the founding of the
American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, his contact with George
Thorndike Angell, whose experiences in a
Chicago stockyard are splendidly described,
and the founding of the Illinois Humane
Society, bring the book to the climax of the
ﬁrst American Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals in action, with Bergh
as the crusading President, who also gives
spark to the ﬁrst Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children.

The book contains many delightful anec-
dotes on Bergh and his relationship with
such men as Greeley, Bennet, Barnum and
many others. It is a must for all who pro-
fess interest in animal welfare and for
everyone else, for that matter. It will
make an ideal Christmas present.

Eugene Field and Animals

In “Eugene Field and His Home” Ida
Comstock Below says that his love for
animals was always a striking character-
istic of his nature. When at school at
Columbia, Missouri, a little black-and-tan
dog called “Penny” was his almost con-
stant companion.

While in Italy he came near being ar-
rested for interfering with some Ital-
ians who were abusing a dog. An Ameri-
can lady driving along and seeing him
and his companion, apparently Ameri-
cans, in trouble, opened her carriage door
and bade them enter quickly, when she
drove rapidly away.

The Sea-Loving Albatross
WILBERT NATHAN SAVAGE

THE great wandering albatross of the

lonely southern seas is one of the few
birds who care nothing for land, living
their quiet lives in perfect contentment
over the rolling ocean waves, a true lover
of the sea—the sailor’s friend.

Actually, the albatross holds a strange
spell over the sailor. He believes this
bird, following a ship for days at a time
with seemingly motionless wings, pos-
sesses an unnatural power, and no sailor
is so bold as to harm one of them. About
this old superstition Coleridge con-

structed his well-known poem, “The An-
cient Mariner.”

OUR DUMB ANIMALS

Suﬂ'ering!
G . E .

The precious uncut diamond caught no rays,

Nor sent such forth in splendor radiant,

Until the artist sharply cleft its form,

Polished its facets, rubbed forth its glory!

Soon it caught the gleams of the burning sun,

Threw forth a million orbs in such a way,

A world amazed cried out, "What hath man
wrought!"

Swoyer

A human soul was one of many souls

Until The Artist polished it with pain,

Carved new facets to catch the Light of God,

And gave it depth and glow through
suffering!

Soon God was reflected in such a way

By that changed soul, rainbows burst through
Life’s storm,

And millions, helped, cried forth, "What hath
God wrought!"

 

The wandering albatross is the largest
of all water birds, and it has the greatest
wing expanse of the entire bird kingdom,
its wings often measuring 10 to 14 feet
from tip to tip. This tremendous wing-
spread seems a bit out of proportion, for
the body of the albatross seldom weighs
as much as 18 pounds, but when one con-
siders the fact that the albatross lives
entirely on the wing, the need for very
powerful wings can be seen. Only when
it comes to the surface of the sea long
enough to snatch a ﬁsh or a bit of refuse
from a ship does the albatross light
momentarily. When it wishes to rise
again it lifts its great wings and runs
along the top of the water for 70 or 80
yards before it can attain “take-off”
speed and again reach its natural home—
the sky.

Unlike most species of birds, both the
male and female albatross dress exactly
alike. They are dressed very warmly,
too, for Mother nature has given them an
excellent coat of ﬁne black and white
feathers.

During the nesting season these in-
teresting birds go to the barren Antarctic
islands, Where the mother lays her single
egg. When the baby bird is hatched, it is
attended with great affection by both
parents.

TO OUR FRIENDS

 

In making your will, kindly bear in mind that the corporate title of
our Society is “The Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals”; that it is the second incorporated (March,
1868) Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the coun-
try, and that it has no connection with any other similar Society.

Any bequest especially intended for the beneﬁt of the Angell
Memorial Animal Hospital, should, nevertheless, be made to the Massa-
chusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals “for the use
of the Angell Memorial Animal Hospital,” as the Hospital is not incor-
porated but is the property of that Society and is conducted by it.

FORM OF BEQUEST
I give to The Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty

to Animals (or to the American. Humane Education Society), the sum
of .......... dollars, (or, if other property, describe the property).
