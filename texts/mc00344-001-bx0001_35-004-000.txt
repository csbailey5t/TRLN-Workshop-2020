‘ Ban proposed on M!

By KAY MILLS
Mississippi Press
Washington Bureau

WASHINGTON —— The Food
and Drug Administration,
‘admitting its present rules are
ineffective, has proposed ban-
ning the sale and distribution of
.- small pet turtles because they
“etuentl carr salmonella

bacteria.

At present, FDA requires that
turtles shipped between states
be tested and certified by state
health officials as free of the sal-
monella and Arizona bacteria,
both of which can cause acute
gastrointestinal illness.

But in the proposal published
in the Federal Register, FDA

Commissione? Alexander M.
Schmidt repofed on a Public
Health Servic é Survey, which
found that 54 o, cent of turtles
retested after aiis certification
last year wfere still con-
taminated. i,

From thistapd other surveys,
Schmidt concluded that “the
present certificiitmn program is

not preventing contaminated
turtles from reaching the mar-
ket,” so other steps are neces-
sary.

‘If the ban becomes final, it
would represent a victory for
Consumers Union (CU), sup-
ported on the issue by the
Humane SoCiety of the United
States and the AnimaLﬂglfare

of pet turtles

Institme.

CU argued that certification
simply wasn’t keeping peop-
le—especially children-f’rom
handling diseased turtles.

I really didn’t expect all that
response! That’s what first
timers say—Dial Want Ads, 762-
1111.

FROM: THE“§ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

Enclosed is a press release and leaflet on the cruel
destruction of the elephants in Africa.

TRADE IN IVORY MUST STOP

After you have read the enclosures I hOpe you will act
promptly to inform your most active members. We will be glad
to send you copies of the enclosed leaflet in quantity.
Please let us know how many you can use effectively.

If there are ShOps in your area who are still selling ivory,
please urge them to follow the lead of Cost Plus,
Nordstrom's, and other major chains intaking ivory out of
their inventory. If they refuse, your leafletting outside
their premises will Show them the public sympathy for the
critical plight of the elephant.

ALL SALES OF IVORY MUST CEASE

AWI will be represented at the biannual meeting of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora in Lausanne, Switzerland October 9-20.
We will provide information to the delegates from the 102
CITES member nations and urge then to ban all international
trade in elephant ivory.

At home, we will be relying on humane societies throughout
the United States to end internal sales of ivory.

Thanks for all you can do. This is an important anti—cruelty
issue as well as an endangered species issue.

102 NATIONS VOTE ON AFRICAN ELEPHANT SURVIVAL

At the meeting of the 102 nations party to the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
Flora (CITES) October 9—20 in Lausanne, Switzerland, the fate
of the African elephant will be sealed.

Hong Kong, historically the hub of the trade in poached
tusks, is seeking a special exemption to sell off its
stockpiled ivory. Unmoved by Kenya's burning of tusks
confiscated from poachers, Hong Kong wants to continue

profiteering from the deaths of upward of a million
elephants.

Tanzania, first to formally prepose an international ban on
ivory trade by the CITES nations, estimates that 94% of ivory
currently on the market came from illegally killed elephants.

Japan, the world's largest consumer of ivory, banned
importation of Hong Kong ivory in June, but by September 20,
so much ivory had been brought in contrary to law that a
total ban had to be established. Yet Hong Kong is seeking a
special exemption to continue selling its ivory stockpiles.

South-Africa and Zimbabwe Oppose Endangered (Appendix I)
listing for the African elephant, but the enclosed news
release from the Environmental Investigation Agency gives a
vivid example of how the southern African countries are used
by the illegal ivory network. The Mail on Sunday shows how
illegal ivory has been made "legal".

The enclosed article by Allan Thornton and the illustrated
leaflet summarize the situation.

Laws threaten Only animal abusers

I am writing in response to the Dec.
18 Public Forum letter,“Puppy mills
issue has another side.” As a college
student at Wichita State University, I
was given an assignment to write a
term paper and I chose as my subject
animal cruelty in scientific experi-
mentation, and related topics. When I
began, I had no particular background
in this subject. I simply wished to find
out for myself what the situation real-
ly was. Those six weeks of research
, not only educated me on the topic,
they sickened, angered and shamed
me. I never actually got into the field
of experimentation; I got bogged down
in material on basic needs such as
food, water, shelter and veterinary
care, or rather, the lack of these life-
sustaining essentials.

I have a 31/2-inch stack of photoco-
pied articles left over from that re-
search, so choosing examples to cite is
1 difficult as there are so many horrify-
ing cases.

In November 1984, a dog dealer in
California was discovered to have in
his kennels “amid piles of feces
the rotting corpses 0f 18 dogs and 19
cats.” In these same kennels were 69
dogs and 18 cats, all starving and de-
hydrated, but still alive (barely).

As for. the medical research which
is considered so necesssry, many live
animal tests are already outdated and
have been replaced by tests which are
just as accurate (usually more easily
measureable) and don’t require live
animals. Those institutes that do still
. require live animals to save human
lives often have appalling records for
the care of these animals.

I can cite a case in point. Perhaps
one of the m0st famous research facil-
ities in this country was found to have
bought stolen pets for research pur-
poses. When the proper owners of

 

 

Research animals: ‘. . . Simply good business sense "to care for them

I

these pets traced their animals to this

facility, they found them to be
starved, dehydrated, beaten and in
some cases quite ill with no veterinary
care. The actual experimentation had
not yet even begun on these animals.

Please do not ask me to believe that
a starved, dehydrated and sick animal
can give good and accurate test re-
sults; I won’t buy it.

The point is this: Animals lack
man’s intelligence. They do not lack
his nerve endings and pain receptors.
If some animal lives are to be sacri-

ficed to save human (and sometimes

other animals’) lives while we search

for new methods that don’t require ’ je‘ct,

these sacrifices, couldn’t we at the
very least feed and water them occa-
sionally? And should we allow people
who refuse to provide basic necessi-
ties to animals to continue to raise and
sell them for profit?

Legislation to provide for animal
welfare does not bother honest animal
dealers as they already properly care
for those animals in their care. Be-
Sides which, who wants to buy sick
and neglected animals anyway? It is
simply good business sense to care for
them.

The only people threatened by legis-
lative control of animal welfare are
those who do not provide proper care,
and in my opinion those people do not
deserve the privilege of participating
in this business._ -_

EDITOR’S NOTE — Of-
ficials are drafting new regu-
lations to insure humane
treatment of . laboratory
animals, with researchers and
animal rights advocates look—

ing over their shoulders. It’s an

effort to stake out a middle
ground in an emotional issue.

WASHINGTON — After a
cease-fire prompted by
protests, Pentagon doctors are
again shooting at pigs and
goats to study how bullets and

shrapnel affect human tissue.

At another government
agency, scientists are inducing
a condition much like
Parkinson’s disease in
monkeys to try to learn more
about how people get the de-

’ bilil:ating illness and how to
treat it. ‘

In other laboratories, re— —
search animals are subjected to
; shocks, isolation, 'or drug de—
pendence to gain insight into
' human behavior.

Such diverse scientific ex—
periments and tests make up
.the broad spectrum of US.

animal research. On some of
the tests ride much of
mankind’s hope for progress
against suffering and disease.
Others hold the prospects for
billions of dollars worth of
current and future commercial
products.

‘Under fire’

But much of the animal
research is under fire, the
subject of vehement debate
over whether there is justifi-
cation for the suffering or

; deaths of the animals that

scientists contend hold the-
keys to knowledge.

Animal welfare advocates,
who have accused researchers
in some instances of running
“concentration camps for
animals,” are stepping up
pressure on the federal gov—
ernment to require humane
care for laboratory animals.

They say many researchers
have‘what Christine Stephens,
the grande dame of animal
welfare lobbyists, calls “a
peculiar philosophy” based on
the belief that animal suffering
is less, or at least less import—
ant, than that of people.

Scientists counter that hor-
ror stories about the treatment
of laboratory animals are the
exception rather than the rule.
They are concerned that
emerging federal rules will tie
their hands or price vital re—
search out of reach.

“We certainly recognize
there are some problems,” says
Melissa Brown of the Associa—
tion of American Medical Col-
leges. “We just differ over the
extent to which there are
problems out there...0ur feel-
ing is that the research is -
beneficial, and it’s helping
mankind AND animals. That’s
the price we haveto pay.”

New legislation

Both sides are closely watch-
ing developments in Washing-
ton,'as chials translate into
concrete‘i'egulations the
provisions of a new law. It’s
designedto strengthen the 20—
year—old Animal Welfare Act,
which governs the treatment
of laboratory animals: .

“It’s taken a terribly long ‘
time,” Stephens says of the
new provisions, which were
included in 1985 farm legis-
lation. “But I think the changes
will make a tremendous dif—
ference. This is a very import-
ant law.” A

The use of animals in labora-
tories is so diverse that no one
has precise figures on how
many creatures are sacrificed
each year in the name of
science.

Millions annually

Congress’ Of ﬁce of Tech—
nology Assessment estimates
that 17 million to 22 million
animals are used in US. scien-
tific experiments and testing
each year. Animal advocates ,
put the figure far higher, at 70
million or more. Because the
nation lacked a comprehensive
mechanism to regulate such
activities, the actual figure is
anyone’s guess.

I will give radical “ammal rights”
activists credit‘ for one thing: they
may not be completely nutty after all.

After analyzing the evidence objec-
tively, I’ll concede that some of their
complaints are valid, and there’s a

degree of progress we can make to..gf=_

reduce unnecessary animal cruelty

That’s quite a change far :fme, 9

because until recently I thought people
who “liberated” animals from
research labs or‘complained that live
stock was “tortured” were the
wackiest of the wacky.

How did they think medical progress
was made, I wondered? Aren’t the
successes against polio, influenza,
smallpox, etc. proof oi the value of
animal research 7 /

If experiments on animals allowed
one infant to live past childhood or
grow up on strong, healthy legs or see
the beauty of a sunset, I’d sacrifice a
million animals and never think twice.

As for cruelty to farm animals,
farmers reply quite rationally that a
healthy, satisfied cow or pig or
chicken will produce more milk or
beef or pork or eggs than an unhealthy
one. They, more than anyone, have a
real interest in giving their livestock
adequate food, shelter and space. _

Today, I 'still feel that medical

research on animals is completely f].

justified, and as far as I know, the
vast majority of farm animals are
well cared for.

But having said that, it should also
we admitted that there are some medi-
:.al experiments that appear to have
crossed the hazy border between nec-
essary and unneccessary, and for that
matter, some farmers could probably
change a few time-honored habits.

For example, in several Well~publi-
cized cases involving animal
experiments to learn more about head
injuries and paralysis, animal activ-
ists presented strong evidence that the
creatures were being abused more
than they had to be.

In one instance, a baboon was
repeatedly struck on the head with a
heavy, hammerlike object to study the
resulting brain damage; I think you’d
have to be a guard at Auschwitz not to
be revolted that specter.

The as

.al...w.eltars...laatltute has 2

also reported cases where the housing
of lab animals —— something which had
nothing to do with their experiments ——
was clearly inadequate. It discovered
rusty cages with sharp protusions,
insects in food, water dishes covered
with green scum and mounds of excre-
ment in tiny living spaces.

The allegations regarding farm ani-
mals appears to be weaker, but again,
there are some cases where certain
types of abuse or neglect just don’t
seem defensible.

Last Tuesday, a group calling itself
the Farm Freedom Fighters (FFF‘)
raided a henhouse in Delaware and
“liberated” 25 laying hens. Lab ani-
mals have been “rescued” before, but

‘ this was apparently the first such raid

on a U.S. farm operation.

The FFF charges that 95 percent of
the eggs sold in America are produced
by the “battery cage system.” in
which four or five hens are crammed
into a 12-by-18-‘inch wire cage.

You don’t have . to be a mushy-
headed sentimentalist to feel uncom-

fortable about that, just as you might

cringe about occasional reports of

‘ hogs or cattle confined to tiny, dark,

indoor pens their entire lives.

Even if these animals are raised for

slaughter, it seems they’d produce
more and better-grade meat if their

al activists make some sense

living space weren’t so limited. And
all things being equal, why not let the
critters feel sunshine occasionally and
have a little space to move around in?

I still think the animal rights move-
ment is top-heavy with extremists, but
we should remember that it wasn’t too
long ago that most people thought it
was perfectly acceptable to inflict all
manner of horrors on household pets.

Even today, an astonishing number
of cretins see no problem in tying a
dog to a fence for days at a time with
no food, water or Shelter, and cats are
still hated and feared by a small group
of peOple who find them too "mysteri-
ous” or “spooky.” L

I shall continue to enjoy steak for
the rest of my days and wear leather
shdes as long as we have sidewalks,
but I’ll also feed a stray now and then
and support the Humane Society.

~ Animals are inferior life forms and

there’s nothing wrong in usingthem to .

better our lives. There’s no reason,
however, we can’t do that With an
absolute minimum of cruelty and max-
imum of concern.

What is certain is that the
f avorities of researchers are
rats and mice; their annual use
in laboratories numbers in the
millions. Research rabbits,
guinea pigs and hamsters total
perhaps a half million each,
the congressional researchers
believe. Use of dogs and cats is
substantially lower, and the
number of primates is in the
tens of thousands.

Animals are used in three
basic ways: for research, rang-
ing from investigations of
cancer and AIDS to behavioral
studies of aggression and ad—
diction; for testing products
like drugs and cosmetics before
they are released for human
use; and, to a much lesser
extent, in education,
particularly of medical and
veterinary students.

Horror stories

Those who advocate strict
limits and standards use oc—
casional horror stories as am-
munition, like a 1981 incident
at Ohio State University.
There, kittens in a laboratory
were given identification tags
on chains around their necks.
As the kittens grew, the chains
became embedded in the
animals’ flesh. The university
settled the case in 1983 by
paying a $500 fine without
admitting guilt.

Much criticism also was
leveled at the University of
Pennsylvania, where tech-
nicians were shown on
videotapes casually bashing
primates’ heads to remove
helmets glued on for a study of
head injuries. The tapes had
been pirated by an under-
ground animal rights group,
the Animal Liberation Front,
and led last year to a $4,000
fine against the university.

 

. w up.

Many researchers may have What Christine
Stephens, the grande dame of animal welfare
lobbyists, calls “a peculiar philosophy” based on the
belief that animal suffering is less, or at least less

m (m:—

 




But those who use animals
say most researchers are cons-
cientious and don’t abuse their
charges.

Like a business

“I’d say it’s like any other
business,” says Jim Hansen, a
spokesman for the US. De-
partment of Agriculture’s
Animal and Plant Health Ini
spection Service, the agency
charged with enforcing the the
Animal Welfare Act. “The vast
mgjgrity of people do a good
JO . . '

In some cases, researchers
have found they can do
without animals.

For example, the cosmetics ,
industry, stung by public criti- ~
cism, learned that products
can be tested through test-
tube methods instead of using
the traditional procedure —
squirting substances in rab—

' bits’ eyes to see whether they
blister or blind the animals.

For most of its history, lab-
oratory animal use has gone
relatively unregulated in the
United States.

PriVate groups have their ‘
own standards, and govern- ‘ ‘
ment agencies like the National
Institutes of Health have ’

. policies governing research
done under federal contracts.

. But it was not until 1966 that
Congress gave such standards
the. force of law, designating
the USDA as the watchdog for
treatment of warm-blooded
animals in laboratories, breed—
ing facilities, pet shops and
zoos.

Animal Welfare Act

That law, the Animal Wel-

fare. Act, governs only the
hmispknpnind nf' ﬂmcp who mp

animals. It specifies cage sizes,
ventilation, sanitation and
feeding requirements, but

leaves decisions about whether
to use animals, or how to use
them, up to the scientists. As
currently administered, it ex-
cludes rats and mice from
protection.

“We're saying you can do
anything you can think of to an
animal in this country” so long
as it is fed and kept in a clean
cage, says Patricia Forkan of

, the Humane Society. Even
those standards, she says, are
: poorly enforced!

The act has been amended
three times. Animal advocates

‘ say last year’s changes are the

most significant yet because,
for the first time, they will
require animal users to setup

. care committees that include

one‘outside, “public” member
with no ties to the institution.

The revisions also include a
requirement that institutions
provide for “the psychological
well-being” of primates and
for regular exercise for caged
dogs -— both changes which

‘ worry researchers because of
‘ the expense of carrying them

out.

“There are no scientific data
wlu'ch say any minimum ex—
ercise per day, or per week, is
physiologically better,” says
Frankie Trull, director of the

2 National Association for
Biomedical Research. “You

} just sleep better at night be-
, cause you think if exercise is
= good for you, it must be good
- for the dog.”

. She says scientists agree in
principle with animal welfare
groups about the need for .
adequatecare. Mistreated
animals, those under abnormal
stress, make for bad research
and dubious results, Trull '
says. and that is one reason

research institutions have de-
veloped their own voluntary
care guidelines.

“But does every rat have the
right to its own house? What is
the trade-of f to the American
public? If we lose animal re—
search what’do we lose in the
process? It could put us 10
years farther away from an
answer to juvenile diabetes.”

Open houses held by some
labs to explain to local animal
activists the nature and value --
of their work have fallen on
deaf ears, says Brown, of the

‘ American Association of
Medical Colleges. At one W'est—

ern school, a scientist spent an

_ entire day with animal ad—

vocates. explaining potential
beneﬁts of research there.
“They were not willing to
listen, and finally he calledthe
meeting off in total frus-

. tration,” Brown says.

‘Species'éism’

Philosophy underlying the
issue covers a broad spectrum,
from those who have no.
qualms about wholesale
animal use to those who accuse -
the rest of society of “species-
ism” — an offense they insist
is akin to racism and sexism.

. Just how much the new law
will affect actual use may be
known as early as June, when
Agriculture Department of—
ﬁcials hope to have a first
draft of the new regulations. In
the meantime there will be
hearings and a public comment
period.

Other new features of the

' law require scientists to be

trained in animal care; for
animals to receive anesthetics,
tranquilizers and pain re-
lievers where possible; for a
new central information ser-
vice to record experimental

results and make them avail-

able to prevent needless dupli-

cation of animal experiments,

, and for annual inspections and

' stiffer fines fOr violators.

‘ Hansen of the USDA says the

changes represent a striking

conflue’nce ofopinions among

_modéfates on both sides of the

' issue but that the task of

, translating the law into regu—.3 .

lations remains half the battle.
“It’s a very emotional issue,

:_ too, ” he says. “I don’ t know

. who on this earth doesn’t feel

; for an animal that’s suffering.”

‘ Kennedy. He is writing a book.

A publisher has not been de-

1 cided on, however. “Well, it was
' going to be Harper and Row,”
- said Bobby, “but we had a fight

The author without a publish-
er is not the senator, but Bobby
Jr., age 13. A knowledgeable.
naturalist, Bobby is writing
about animals and is approach-
ing the subject with zeal.

He completed one 50-page
book on the subject, decided “it
wasn’t good enough” and began
a new one in February. 1

He has been interviewing
people — Secretary of the In-
terior Stewart Udall and Mrs.
Roger Stevens, wife of the spe-

' cial assistant to the President
and herself president of the Ani- .
mal Welfare Institute in New
York City.

HE S T O P P E D Secretary
Udall with: “What are the three
rarest animals in the United
States?” and “Why are alli—
gators in danger of extinction?”

Reptiles are Bobby’s special
interest. He is in charge of the
terrarium (a glass-enclosed, spe-
cially heated garden) in the
basement playroom at Hickory ,
Hill, where a collection of tur-
tles and lizards lives. Right
now, they’re low on lizards, he
explains, because there was a
failure in the terrarium’s heat
and light system last Septem-
ber and all the lizards froze to
death.

Bobby is keeping a file card

Alekai Marlaine ls Chosen
Over Miniature—English
Springer Leads Group

 

 

l By JOHN RENDEL

A jet-black Scottish Terrier
from England, E. H. Stuart‘s
Oh. Bardene Bingo, of Cama-
tion, Wash, was named best in
show at the 9lst Westmister

event at Madison Square Gar-
den last night.

An English Springer Spaniel,
Ch. Salilyn’s Aristocrat, belong-
ing to Mr. F. H. Gaslow of Troy,
Mich, was among the finalists.

Apoodle also became one of
the qualifiers for the final in
one of the country’s glamour
dog show but those who
thought it inevitable that it
would be of the miniature
variety were proved wrong.

The Scottie was the one who
arrived in this country with a .
formidable reputation and made .3 .
it stand up with best-in-show Ch. Merry Rover of Valley Run,
victories in tWO big California at Madison Square Garden. Bill
event5-—Bevel'ly Hills in. 1965 . __ ..,
and Santa Barbara last year — ‘
among others. But in his first
Westminster effort a year ago
he did not get out of the breed.
He was sent 3,000 miles across
country to avenge that; defeat
and did it; with a vengeance
under the handling of Bob Bar-
tos. He held English, Canadian
and American championships.

George M. Parham judged the
sporting dogs. He found Aris-
trocat to be “a free—moving,
very typy dog, a real springer,
not a cocker spaniel.

“I have shown some of the
finest springer spaniels and this
one is as good as any of them,"
the judge said.

In January the springer
gained the top award of the
American Spaniel Club to
launch 1967 on a high note. The
liver-and-white spaniel subse—
quently went on to five other
Ibests. three of them on the Flor-
ida circuit. His life—time bests
numbered 24. Dick Cooper was
the handler. -

Are Scientists Inhumane?

Lucy Eisenberg and the medical
researchers for whom she spoke
[“Scientists vs. Animal Lovers: The
Conﬂict that Never Ends,” Novem-
ber] have been remiss in their re-
search. They state categorically that
laboratory animals must suffer pain
to beneﬁt mankind. They owe it to
the animals, the public, and their
own professional aims to investigate
the extremely provocative ﬁndings
which reveal that the laboratory ani-
mal is no longer the best “research
tool.”

Substitutes for vertebrate ani-
mals, ranging from computers to
tissue culture, have been found by
scientists to save time and money,
avoid error, and yield more valid re-
sults. For example, Dr. Ross F.
N igrelli, director of the Laboratory
of Marine Biochemistry and Ecology
at the New York Aquarium, stated,
“In testing drugs we use sea urchin
eggs because the fertilization cycle
is well known and results are avail-
able within forty-eight hours. The
eggs may be stimulated to develop
without fertilization . . . or there may
be deviations in cell division. We could
have told them about thalidomide
very quickly, had we tested it on sea-
urchin eggs.”

We hope that the medical research-
ers will voluntarily don the mantle of
science and investigate their own
methods and these new techniques. A
summary on substitutes for verte-
brate animals in medical research
may be had by sending a stamped,
self-addressed envelope to Friends of
Animals, Inc., 17 West 60 Street, New
York, NY. 10023.

Lucy Eisenberg’s article is doubly
welcome to biomedical scientists;
she has cheered us with her under-
standing and she has supplied a voice
in the community of intellect to bal-
ance the shriller cries of some others.
. . . In 1952 the Institute of Labora-
tory Animal Resources (ILAR) of

Harper’s Magazine, January 1967

the National Academy of Sciences-
National Research Council was or-
ganized by scientists for scientists to
cope with the many problems of
laboratory animals, including care,
exacerbated by the rapid expansion
of biomedical research at the end of
World War II. By the standards
drafted by its committees, by sym-
posia and publications ILAR sought
to improve the quality and the tone of
laboratory animal experimentation.
But the mood of the 89th Congress
outran this silent and succeeding
evolution.

Now, for the ﬁrst time in U. S. his-
tory, we have a law. The law’s original
intent was to stop the stealing of pets.
With this no one quarrels. But the
momentum of the legislative process,
fueled by nonscientists, has carried
it through the laboratory door and
up to the laboratory bench. The bio-
medical scientist is grateful that
enough members of the Congressional
committees involved saw to it that it
stopped there. ILAR will redouble its
efforts so that scientists can learn to
live with the new law, and so that re-
search will not be impeded. Articles
like Mrs. Eisenberg’s should help the
citizen decide when or whether the
legislative engines in this area need
to be started up again.

HOWARD A. SCHNEIDER, Ph.D.
Chairman, ILAR

Washington, DC.

Cleveland Amory brought down a
copy of the November Harper’s for
me to read the “Scientists vs. Animal
Lovers” story. I was amazed and dis-
tressed that Harper’s would publish
such an untruthful article and one
which was so full of the well-worn
propaganda points used by the Na-
tional Society for Medical Research
and its allies for years in their at-
tempt to head off all legislation to give
any protection whatsoever to research
animals. That they made little im-
pression on the U. S. Senate was
demonstrated by the 85 to 0 vote for
the new law. . . .

It is irritating to read that I
drafted a bill which was, in fact,

drafted by Supreme Court Justice
Abe Fortas before he was appointed
to the Court, a well-known fact, since
he received the Schweitzer Medal for
this very thing last year, then to have
the bill which Senator Joseph Clark
introduced be incorrectly summar-
ized. The testimony my daughter
Christabel submitted in 1962 clearly
and accurately describes conditions
we saw at St. Vincent’s Hospital, but
it seems strange to use four-year-old
material that I didn’t say or write as
a quote from me when I am so readily
accessible to anyone who wants in-
formation. . . .
The new P. L. 89-544 is going to be
a tremendous force for good; and as I
see the situation at present, the chief
ﬁeld of battle is to keep the AMA et al
from undermining it. An attempt to
prevent any funds from being allowed
the U. S. Department of Agriculture
to carry it out was headed off just be-
fore Congress adjourned, though the
funds were greatly reduced as a result
of this assault. The hard core op-
ponents of decent treatment of ani-
mals are wonderfully active!
CHRISTINE STEVENS, Pres.
Animal Welfare Institute
New York, N. Y.

Lucy Eisenberg’s article contains
such gross factual inaccuracies, erro-
neous quotations, and irrational prej-
udice in interpretations that the real
issues are confused beyond recogni-
tion.

Contrary to the impression she
gives of disunity over legislation, the
two major national humane societies
(The Humane Society of the U. S.
and the American Humane Assn.)
are united behind one measure, the
Rogers-McIntyre bill of the 89th
Congress. . . .

To quote me as saying “The ‘Move-
ment’ was dying out until we discov-
ered that this [the antiresearch cam-
paign] was the angle to take” is a wild
distortion of my statement that some
ﬁfteen years ago Fred Myers founded
The Humane Society of the U. S., es—
tablished a new moral framework,
deﬁned new goals, and breathed new
vigor into the movement. The smear
of crassly materialistic motives in
operation of this Society is totally
unwarranted. . . .

Further, in labeling me personally
as a newcomer to the movement, Mrs.
Eisenberg strays far from fact. For

LETTERS

over twenty years I have been active
in humane work as a board member
and president of the Animal Protec-
tive Assn. of St. Louis County, Mis-
souri, and as a founding director and
then president of The Humane Soci-
ety of the U. S.

Mrs. Eisenberg is guilty of further
distortion in her description of pro-
posed legislation and in placing
the issues in the context of anti-
vivisectionists versus scientists. . . .
Not a single national antivivisection
society supports the regulatory leg-
islation endorsed by the humane s0-
cieties. (Mrs. Eisenberg’s “Anti-
Vivisection League” is nonexistent.)

Mrs. Eisenberg would have her
readers believe that the scientiﬁc
community is united against federal
legislation for the humane treatment
of research animals, with the humane
societies as the only proponents.
Again, nothing could be farther from
fact. The New York State Society for
Medical Research supports a regula—
tory bill introduced by Senator
Jacob Javits and Congressman Leo
O’Brien. Representatives of the Na-
tional Institutes of Health and of the
Department of Health, Education.
and Welfare recently testiﬁed before
Congress that there is a need for fed-
eral legislation for the humane treat-
ment of laboratory animals. . . . The
legislation endorsed by the humane
societies will do a great deal for ani-
mals and will not cripple scientiﬁc
research.

OLIVER EVANS, Pres.

The Humane Society of the U. S.

Washington. DC.

MRS. EISENBERG REPLIES:

The issue in question is not whether
there should be some federal legisla-
tion governing animal care (since the
new law setting standards for trans—
portation and handling is already in
effect), but whether there is a need
for additional legislation that would
regulate experimentation and the uses
to which animals can be put. No scien-
tist supports this kind of legislation.
as Mr. Evans well knows.

I apologize to Mrs. Stevens for say-
ing that she “drafted” a bill rather
than she “inspired” it; I further apol-
ogize to Mr. Evans for calling him a
newcomer to the Movement when I
meant merely that he was a newcomer
to animal legislation on the national
scene.

 




Lacy Eisenberg'
SCIENTISTS

vs. ANIMAL LOVERS

THE CONFLICT THAT NEVER ENDS

Real concern for the welfare of dogs and monkeys used in
laboratories has stirreol emotions—and may produce laws that
will hamstring research for the beneﬁt of human beings.

Anyone who reads the morning papers has
probably seen shocking advertisements about
cruelty to laboratory animals. One ad shows hun-
dreds of rabbits with their necks clamped into
wooden stocks. Another warns of terrible experi-
ments in which animals are burned, cut, and
ﬂayed. But, say the ads, there is a way to bring
these cruelties to an end. The remedy is a bill
before Congress, which will curb the inhumanity
of science. If we will only write to our Congress-
men, the humane societies promise that thousands
of animals will be spared unnecessary pain.

What are the facts about these so-called animal-
care bills? Are the humane societies’ claims really
true? Or is it true, as the scientists maintain, that
the real purpose of the bills is not to improve care
but to put limits on experimentation? As I looked
into these questions I made some disturbing dis-
coveries. I found that some laboratory animals do
not get adequate care. I also found that humane
organizations are not always mindful of the truth.
Finally, I found that their bills are riddled with
defects. They will do very little for animal welfare
but they could seriously cripple scientiﬁc re-
search.

Pet lovers encompass a broad spectrum of feel-
ing. Some sensitive ladies refuse to eat meat.
Others eat meat but won’t buy alligator bags. Still
others campaign against hunting. Vivisection is
only one of many cruelties that they oppose. In
recent months, however, it has become an obses-
sion with animal lovers all over the country.

The popularity of the animal-care bills with so
many pet lovers is itself a peculiar fact. Why are

so many people preoccupied with the alleged
cruelty of research? Why do they praise Dr.
Jonas Salk in one breath and condemn experi-
mentation in another? There is no simple answer
to this question. One doctor suggested to me that
this, like other outbreaks of antiscientiﬁc feeling,
is simply an expression of nostalgia—a wish for
the good old days when life was uncomplicated by
things like LSD and the hydrogen bomb. Psychia-
trists, unquestionably, have their own explana-
tions. Whatever the reason, there is no doubt that
sentiment against vivisection is stronger today
than at any other time in this century.

This revival of antivivisection sentiment, and
the agitation to control experimentation is due
largely to an organization called the Animal Wel-
fare Institute, and to its director, Mrs. Roger L.
Stevens. Mrs. Stevens is not the dumpy old lady
in tweeds that one pictures as a professional ani-
mal loverﬁ“ Instead, she is a member of New
York social circles; an elegant and superbly
dressed woman (as her pictures in Vogue attest).
She is married to Roger Stevens, a Democratic
party bigwig and Special Assistant to the Presi-
dent on the Arts, as well as Chairman of the John
F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. She
is intelligent; she has pull; and, though she is not
an antivivisectionist, she has very ﬁrm convictions
about the need for humane legislation. In her opin-
ion science is unnecessarily cruel, and the way to
eliminate this barbarism is to put the federal
government in control of animal research.

*See “That Mrs. Stevens, the Animals’ Best Friend,”
by Faubion Bowers (Harper’s, July 1962).

 




 

102 SCIENTISTS VS. ANIMAL LOVERS

In 1960 Mrs. Stevens drafted a bill and had it
introduced in Congress by Senator John Sherman
Cooper. (A similar bill was introduced in the 88th
Congress by Representative James C. Cleveland
and Senator Joseph S. Clark.) The purpose of both
bills is “To provide humane treatment for animals
used in experiments and tests.” Under their pro-
visions, every research scientist must procure a
license from the Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare. Before he performs any speciﬁc ex-
periment, the scientist must ﬁle a project plan with
the Secretary and receive permission to proceed.
In addition, he must ﬁle an annual report specify-
ing the number of animals he used, procedures
employed, and a copy of his research proposals.
The Secretary is empowered to turn down research
proposals, to revoke a scientist’s license, and to
stop his research altogether by terminating his
government grants.

This proposal created a sensation. Animal lovers
all over the country began to clamor for federal
legislation. Although the prestigious American
Humane Association put off taking a stand, the
National Catholic Society for Animal Welfare
began ﬁghting for a bill right away. The Humane
Society of the United States (HSUS) joined battle
too, with gratifying results as far as its member-
ship rolls were concerned. The Society now claims
close to a million members and its president, Oliver
Evans, attributes its growth to the antiresearch
campaign. “The ‘Movement’ was dying out,” he
says, “until we ﬁnally discovered that this was the
angle to take.”

Evans himself is a newcomer to the Movement,
and in some ways he seems out of place. He has a
sense of humor, for one thing, and he does not
take moral stands. In fact he readily admitted to
me that hunting causes much more pain than
science; but the Society does not campaign against
hunting because, as he put it, “If we tried to stamp
out hunting they’d just stamp us out instead.” He
has a pragmatic approach to the campaign for an
animal-care bill. When Mrs. Stevens’ bill ran into
trouble because of certain overstrict provisions,
he drafted an alternate piece of legislation.

Evans believed that his bill would pass Congress
this year. It did not, for a variety of reasons. One
was dissension in the Movement (the National
Catholic Society wanted something stronger; the

 

Lucy Eisenberg confesses interest in animal care

in the U. S. and in Britain, and she comes from a
large family of poodle lovers and owners. Mrs.
Eisenberg is now a resident of Pasadena, and her
husband is a chemist at Cal Tech.

ASPCA thought the bill too strict). Another rea-
son was the dognapping issue, which suddenly
came to a head. The HSUS diverted its efforts to
controlling animal dealers and outlawing the steal-
ing of pets.* The bill to control vivisection has
been put off for yet another year. There is no
question, however, that the ﬁght will continue,
and when the Ninetieth Congress convenes, more
stringent bills are sure to be reintroduced.

Pain with a Purpose

Is there a need for such legislation? Is science
really inhumane? I could not stiﬂe the feeling that
most animal lovers start off with afﬁrmative
answers and then go out to gather their facts. In
any case, a great many people are devoting their
time to exposing the cruelties of science. Some of
them work with Mrs. Stevens, others for the
HSUS and some for small organizations or on
their own. They tour laboratories all over the
country. They interview students who are disillu-
sioned with research. If deception is necessary,
they sneak into buildings after dark or take jobs
as animal handlersﬁi’x‘ In this way they have
gathered a good deal of evidence and built up a
case against research.

An example of what they ﬁnd is this quotation
from Mrs. Stevens. Testifying before Congress in
1962, she described the conditions in a “well-
known” New York City hospital (otherwise un-
named) : “The dogs,” she said, “were kept in small,
dirty mesh—bottom cages with no bedding. They
were in a dark, dirty, smelly little room that was
so infested that the animals, the ﬂoor, and the
walls were alive and crawling with vermin. These
vermin were breeding in a heap of excrement; they
were so thick on the ﬂoor that they were crawling
over my feet.” Later at that hearing an HSUS
inspector described a hospital in Cincinnati where
monkeys were kept in Wire-mesh cages with heavy

*In August, President Johnson signed this bill
(HR 13881) which also sets standards for animal
care. It does not, however, provide for federal regula-
tion of actual experimentation on animals.

‘1'“5‘For example, in 1959, HSUS brought a complaint
against Linda Loma University (formerly the Col-
lege of Medical Evangelists) in California. The case
was based on evidence gathered by Thomas O. Ham-
mond, an investigator for HSUS, who took a job as
an animal caretaker at the college. When the State
Department of Health looked into the case, it found?"
that the facts did not warrant disciplinary action}
HSUS challenged the Board in the courts, but both
the lower court and the appeal court upheld the Boa1 d i,

chains dangling from their necks. He too saw evi-
dence of ﬁlth but even worse, he said, were the
technicians who cleaned cages with hoses, turning
hot and cold water on animals too sick to rise.

Such conditions are indeed revolting. They cry
out for immediate reform. But dirty cages and
vermin have nothing to do with Vivisection as
such. Since the humane societies believe that ex-
perimentation itself should be restricted, they also
have to prove to Congress that scientists are un-
necessarily cruel. This they have tried to do by
reading through professional journals and clip-
ping reports of experiments that sound as if they
caused pain. The societies cite these experiments
in their publications and at Congressional hear-
ings. It is very doubtful to my mind, however,
whether any one of the hundreds they have quoted
is really an example of “unnecessary” or “avoid-
able” pain.

What, for instance, are we to make of testimony
from the late Fred Myers, the past president of
HSUS? At the 1962 hearing Mr. Myers described
an experiment at Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research which, he whispered with horror, “was
deliberately designed to cause pain.” The experi-
ment consisted of implanting wire electrodes in
the head of a monkey and then passing currents
through its brain. The pain was so intense, said
Mr. Myers, that the monkey screamed and grim-
aced and tried vainly to escape. He implies, of
course, that this is “unnecessary” pain. But what
he does not say is that the recent discovery that
there are “pain” and “pleasure” centers in the

brain is a milestone in neurological research.
(Nor does he say that there is no other way to
locate the pain center than by the procedure de—
scribed.) The experiment may have sounded un-
necessarily cruel, but someday neurosurgeons will
utilize that knowledge to treat thousands of people
who suffer from intractable pain.

There are two other types of experiments which
the animal lovers quote as examples of “unneces-
sary” pain. One is research on burns, and the other
is stress. “Stress,” in the technical sense, is an
important clinical syndrome; shock (which is re-
lated to stress) causes thousands of deaths every
year among burn Victims, women in childbirth,
and patients who have had “successful” operations
but die in the recovery room. Burns, too, claim
thousands of victims. Doctors are searching des—
perately for better ways to treat burns; for ways
to prevent infection and to halt the onset of shock.
Why then do the advocates of an animal-care law
continually emphasize the fact that animals are
“scalded” and “burned”? Do they want to stop
research in this ﬁeld altogether? Or are they
simply resorting to demagoguery and, by appeal-
ing to our emotions, helping to complicate an issue
which is already sufﬁciently complex?

My own feeling is that the testimony that em-
phasizes “burning” and “scalding” is simply and
deliberately misleading. This research will con—
tinue whether or not the animal—care law is passed.
Advocates of the bills claim they will not stop vital
research. But what they will surely do (as a simi-
lar law now does in Britain) is to smother research

“Coward!”

 




106 SCIENTISTS VS. ANIMAL LOVERS

in a mass of bureaucratic red tape. The dispenser
of this red tape, called the Coordinator of Animal
Welfare, will sit in his ofﬁce in Washington and
pass on proposals for research. He will not approve
experiments that have already been done. He may
suggest to the experimenter that he use fewer ani-
mals, or a different species from the one that he
wants. The coordinator could bring research to a
halt. What is far more likely, however, is that he
will prevent one or two scientists from being cruel
and, in the process, seriously hamper all the rest.

Every scientiﬁc society in the country has gone
on record against such a law, including the Ameri-
can Heart Association, the College of Physicians,
and the College of Surgeons. Animal lovers assume
that any scientist who opposes their bills enjoys
being cruel. But there are good reasons for the sci-
entists’ determined stand.

By way of an example, one scientist told me this
story. Two years ago, he said, the Humane Society
of the U.S. published an article in its Newsletter
about the laboratories at New York University
Medical Center. To illustrate how bad conditions
were, they included a picture, albeit a fuzzy one,
of a Dalmatian-type dog lying prostrate on the
floor of its cage. According to the article, the dog
had had severe abdominal surgery and had been
lying for eighteen hours without postoperative
care. In fact, said my informant (who was in
charge of the N YU laboratories at the time), the
dog was easy to identify because of its markings.
It turned out that this particular dog had had two
small stainless-steel valves implanted in its chest
twelve months before the picture was taken. On
the day of the humane inspector’s visit, the dog
had been X-rayed and doctors had sedated it to
make sure it would lie still on the machine. It had
not been operated on that day; it had never had
abdominal surgery, and it did not lie for eighteen
hours before an attendant checked it.

The dishonesty of some humane groups has dis-
gusted many scientists and led them to oppose
their political positions. The animal lovers are also
given to making accusations without naming the
laboratory in question or the journal in which an
experiment was reported. When the facts are
ﬁnally tracked down, it often turns out that the
report has been misquoted or an important fact
(e.g., that the animal was anesthetized) has been
completely overlooked. So many scientists have
found this to be true that they no longer listen to
anything the humane societies say.

Scientists also object to speciﬁc provisions of
the animal-care laws, particularly the requirement
that proposals be submitted to Washington. As
one scientist put it, “All the best things I’ve ever

done were done just on a hunch and usually in the
middle of the night."

The bills are supposed to prevent duplication
of work. It is well known to scientists, however,
that many important discoveries were made when
one skeptical scientist decided to try to duplicate
another man’s work. Finally, scientists object to
the idea that a “coordinator” inside the Depart-
ment of Health, Education, and Welfare is sup-
posed to redesign experiments and limit the num-
ber of animals used. This measure alone could
cripple research, as one scientist testiﬁed to Con-
gress. “It is a fantasy,” he said, “to suppose that
a Washington coordinator could appropriately
determine the number and species of animals to
be used. Tens of thousands of scientists try to
discover new knowledge, and this bill would make
the intellectual competence of these thousands
futile by imposing the judgment of a coordinator
upon them.”

Who Is “Qualiﬁed”?

The scientiﬁc societies are determined to ﬁght
these restrictions and so are scientists in govern-
ment research institutions (“Over my dead body,”
an ofﬁcial at the National Institutes of Health told
me). This does not mean, however, that doctors
and scientists don’t worry about laboratory ani-
mals. Many of them are revolted by reports of sub-
standard conditions and would like to see animal
care improved.

“Why don’t they provide better care then?” an
animal lover might ask. The answer is that the
scientists who carry out research often have noth-
ing to do with animal care. In fact, many of them
have never seen the inside of an animal room.
When a scientist needs two cats or ﬁfty rats for
an experiment, he calls up the animal “facility”
in his hospital and orders them over the phone.
When the experiment is ﬁnished, the animals go
back where they came from.

Then who is responsible for animal care? This
varies from one place to another. In some hospitals
and universities there is a central animal facility
and it is run by a professional veterinarian. In
others, there is an administrator in charge of
animals who has no medical training at all. In
still others there is a separate animal room for
each department (e.g., medicine, biochemistry,
microbiology). Often, responsibility for animal
care is badly deﬁned. Fortunately, however, the
trend in new research centers is to build a cen-
tralized facility and, if money is available, to hire
a professional veterinarian to run it.

 




This is a laudable idea, assuming that there are
veterinarians available and that they are qualiﬁed
to take charge of a lab. But both these assumptions
are false. The fact is that there are too few veteri-
narians in the country and even they do not know
how to treat monkeys and mice. They don’t know
how to give a rat an injection or cure a chimpanzee
of diarrhea. The administration of an animal lab-
oratory raises manifold problems that do not ap-
pear in textbooks or in any veterinary course.

Lack of training for laboratory directors is one
reason why animal care is not better. Another is
lack of training for animal technicians. The Ani-
mal Care Panel, which is a society of veterinar-
ians, laboratory directors, and commercial breed-
ers, has tried to tackle this problem by providing
courses in animal handling. (One humane group,
the ASPCA in New York City, also sponsors such
a course; so does the Ralston Purina Company.)
But these courses are expensive to run and they
don’t reach nearly enough people. The majority of
laboratory—animal technicians are still totally un-
trained. They may not even like animals. “They
just come in off the street,” as one professor at
Princeton University put it. When this is the case,
it is hardly surprising that animals do not get
proper care.

There is a third reason why animal care is in-
adequate, why cages are crowded and laboratories
badly understaffed. This, not surprisingly, is lack
of money. The animal lovers maintain that re-
search grants are generous enough. But what they
do not understand is that there are administrative
restrictions on these grants so they can’t be used
for improving animal facilities. Some institutions
get unrestricted grants, but these don’t get used
for animals either. As one administrator told me,
“It is a rare president or dean who will use money
for animal facilities when he could hire a Nobel
Prize winner or build a ﬂashy new lab” with the
funds.

Agouti on the East River

I t is ironic that money is the key problem; that
the Anti-Vivisection League spends half a million
dollars every year while hospitals don’t build
better kennels because they can’t raise private
funds to match government grants. But this does
not justify the implication in so many humane
publications that when animal care is inadequate,
the reason is deliberate neglect. Running a labora-
tory is a difficult job that requires specialized
knowledge, a competent staff, and adequate funds.

Given enough money and a well-trained director,

animal care can be good. I saw this on a tour of ,
the animal rooms at New York University Medical
Center. I chose N YU for my visit because the ani-
mals there are housed in a single central unit
(called the Berg Institute), and because Dr. L. R.
Christensen, the director, is an expert on animal
care.

The Institute rises six stories above the East
River, and as we waited for the elevator Dr.
Christensen sketched in some facts. He said that
more than 90 per cent of the animals used at N YU
are kept in the Institute. The rest include a few
monkeys who live out on Long Island, some mice
that are being inbred to produce a pure genetic
strain, and some other small rodents that are in-
fected with human pathogens and therefore kept
in isolation. How many animals are in the Insti-
tute now? About 5,000 mice, 1,250 rats, 1,100
guinea pigs, 700 rabbits, 130 dogs, 45 cats, and a
few other assorted mammals. Is this unusually
large for an animal unit? By no means. It is just
about average: smaller than some, larger than
others.

When we looked at the animals themselves, I
was amazed. I had expected to see overcrowding
and at least some dogs and cats who were mangy
and underfed. (Since hospitals buy unclaimed
dogs from city pounds, one would expect to ﬁnd
animals who still showed the effects of wandering
homeless through the streets.) But in the ﬁrst
room we visited I saw forty-ﬁve healthy-looking
dogs, which barked lustily when I came in,
thumped their tails against the sides of their cages
and happily licked at my hand. In the postopera-
tive room there were eight or nine animals, some
lying quietly in their cages, others up and walking
around. I saw no open wounds, and no signs of
distress—in fact, no signs at all that experiments
had been done except for cards on each of the cages
that noted what had taken place. (On each of these
cards there is also a number that corresponds to
a card in the office downstairs; except for the mice,
the office keeps individual records for every animal
including the date of its arrival, the place from
which it came, and the investigator who is using it.

After leaving the dog rooms, we saw rabbits
(regular and lop-eared), woodchucks, squirrels,
monkeys, guinea pigs, rats, and mice. We also saw
creatures called Agouti that look like the off-
spring of an unfortunate cross between a tapir
and a miniature poodle. I realized then the diffi-
culties that a laboratory director faces with large
numbers of animals, limited space, and new species
he has never seen before. The laboratory director
must be architect, veterinarian, and research di-
rector rolled into one; it is a difficult job.

 




110_ SCIENTISTS VS. ANIMAL LOVERS

When the tour was over, I asked Dr. Christen-
sen about conditions in the other laboratories he
has seen. How do they compare to NYU? His
answer was that some laboratories provide excel-
lent care but others, unfortunately, do not. There
are too many laboratories, he said, which are
understaffed, overcrowded, and badly designed.
There are even some places with shiny equipment
and new country kennels where the animals are
still in poor condition. But, he added, he has never
seen conditions as horrible as those the humane
inspectors describe. Nor, he said, is there anything
in this country as bad as the breeding farms he
saw in England, or laboratories elsewhere in.
Europe. Dr. Christensen attended an internaw
tional conference this spring on laboratory-animal
care, and in his opinion we are much further
along in this ﬁeld than most of the countries
in Europe.

A Matter of Money

The laboratories at New York University con-
vinced me of the need for “new” or “additional”
legislation to help improve animal care. If more
hospitals could afford such facilities, if there were
more courses for animal technicians and more
directors with Dr. Christensen’s training, then
care would be immeasurably improved. If Con-
gress would provide money for physical improve-
ments and grants to the veterinary schools, then
care would improve. Without money from federal

grants, there will still be overcrowded cages, ill-
equipped kennels, and undertrained staff.

I do not believe, however, that there is a need
for restrictions on research. I am not persuaded
that scientists are needlessly cruel. And I think it
is not feasible to license every scientist in this
country and make him write for permission before
he starts a new piece of work. (There is such a
law in Britain, but ours is a much larger country
and our research is on a much larger scale.)
Finally, I do not agree with the basic assumption
that legislation can make a scientist humane.
Could a government committee really have this
effect? Surely what a scientist does in his labora-
tory is determined partly by his technical com-
petence and partly by his reverence for life. If a
scientist is careless or inhumane, his colleagues
can restrain him far more effectively than can an
inspector in Washington who reads over the pro-
posals he submits.

It is comforting to think that a single piece of
legislation could save innocent animals from pain.
But the antivivisectionists live in an imagi-
nary world. They accept the beneﬁts of modern
medicine, as do we all, but they refuse to face
the consequence that animals have to suffer pain.
Modern medicine would not be possible without
animal research, and without inﬂicting some pain
on the animals involved. I do not like the idea of
painful experiments—on a monkey or even a
mouse. But I am not willing to restrict vivisection
and give up the beneﬁts that come from medical
research-

 

DROUGHT IN LONDON

by C. Garrett-Jones

Shouldn’t 1, writing, sitting, now she is gone,

Sow, if only a few,
Tears across my paper?

Twice she was sweet, twice sober.

They’d be the last tears shed

Before I shed the shells and moths of this house

And go, I too,

To sow some oats in good ground, oats for good horses.

But tears will not come in this house.

On the ﬁeld the weeds win,

And the blue cloud is dry with pity.
Where is the sweet, or the bitter water?

All the water is gone.

Dear Christine,

Thank you for your nice letter of November
22nd. I’m.glad that you're willing to have your
letter to me, slightly revised, printed in Harper's
and look forward to seeing it there. It‘s a good letter.

John Fischer tells me that he has not heard
anything from the Reader's Digest with regard to con-
densation of the animal piece.

As ever,

Mrs. Roger Stevens

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Thank you for your letter of No-
vember 17, which we have scheduled for publication
in our January issue. Because we received a con-
siderable volume of correSpondence about the
Eisenberg article, including a long letter from
Mr. Evans-which duplicates some of the points you
made, we have had to make a few minor cuts in your
letter -- without damage, I think, to your essen-
tial message, or without diminishing your blaze
of indignation.

I understand of course why you dis-
agree with the article, although I'm not at all
convinced that it is ”untruthful.”

Sincerely,

\

Dear Christine:

Thank you for your letter of October Bl which I showed to
John FiSCher, the Editor of the Magazine. He was impressed, as
I was, with the way you marshalled your arguments against the
Harper's Magazine piece by Lucy Eisenberg. In fact he would
like this letter and asked me to write you to this effect.
Accordingly I suggest that you send the letter to him, elimin-
ating two or three references that would not fit into a formal
communication to the Editor of a magazine.

I am truly sorry that the Eisenberg piece distressed you.
Actually I did not know of the existence of the article until
it had already been printed.

Please forgive me for not signing this letter personally
but I must leave the office before it can by typed.

As ever,
