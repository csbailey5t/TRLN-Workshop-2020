REPORT ; 1 924

 

Britisﬂ Vim’recz‘zbﬂ Crag/tier and our
Campaign for Aéo/z’tz’m

The Home Ofﬁce returns issued in July, I925, reveal the sad
fact that I77,8I5 experiments on living animals Were performed
in the laboratories of England, Scotland and Wales during the
year 1924.

Of this huge total, 168,653 experiments were performed Without
anaesthetics. These included inoculations to produce various
diseases, unnatural feeding and starvation experiments.

The victims of the vivisectors are outside the ordinary law of
the land relating to cruelty to animals. The Act of Parliament
protecting the vivisectors more than the helpless creatures
concerned.

The experiments upon horses, dogs, cats, rabbits and other
creatures involve varying degrees of misery and wretchedness,
and, in many cases, prolonged pain and suffering.

R.S.P.C.A. Inspectors and independent investigators are kept
out of the laboratories. (Special permits are occasionally granted,
but only at speciﬁed times, and not to all parts of the research
laboratories).

Endeavour: to Alix/cad z‘fze Pué/z'c

Attempts are constantly being made by vivisectors through
the medium of the Press, to assure the public that the Act protects
the animals by a clause which states: “That in the case of
severe suffering which is likely to endure after eXperiments, the
animal is to be killed.”

But it leaves the vivisector to be the judge of What is severe
pain, and to estimate the likelihood of its long endurance. Such
protection is hypocritical; Royal Commission inquiries reveal
the fact that vivisectors admit that they have little regard for
the suffering of animals.

The vivisector has his ﬁner moral feelings blunted, and is
unable to judge pain by common sense standards.

The Whole Act is full of subterfuge and evasions.

Branch Efforts to secure the Abolition of Vivisection.—-
We continue to make splendid progress in our campaign, even
though the Medical Research Council and large sections of the
Press do their utmost to oppose and crush our efforts, and to
conceal the truth.

Special Note.——Our letters showing the cruelty, folly, and
danger of vivisection and inoculation are refused insertion by
sections of the Press, who ignore. the best traditions of fair play.
Even our advertisements are carefully scrutinised and lines
deleted, whilst the fullest publicity is given to our opponents.
There is strong reason to believe that powerful pressure is brought
to bear upon editors of newspapers, by medical vivisectionists
and other interested parties, to inﬂuence them against publishing
our articles and letters. - -

Broadcasting—Will members kindly inform the Committee
of any references to vivisection, direct or indirect, by speakers
from the BBC. ?

Grateful Thanks are given to all our supporters for their
splendid help, so kindly given in many departments of our difficult
Campaign. To set forth in detail the many activities of the
Branch, week by week throughout the year, would require a
lengthy and costly report.

We desire to place on record our appreciation of the good work
of Mrs. J. Bently Capper, who, though absent from Manchester,
continues her splendid efforts for the defenceless. We are in
constant communication with Mrs. Capper. Her letters to the
Press are always helpful. A testimonial from this Branch was
presented during 1924.

New Members.—Ninety new members have been enrolled
during 1924. We appeal to all who stand for justice and humanity
to join with us in this great crusade against cruelty and impurity.
Please interest your friends. Men and women of all creeds and
parties are supporting us.- We oppose all cruelty to any creature.

Meetings,—Many successful gatherings have been held. We
are deeply grateful to speakers, chairmen, artistes, and all who
so generously give their services to the Cause.

Lectures, Debates, and Addresses.—-The Secretary has
opened debates, given lectures and addresses before many
societies, classes and institutions, upon the moral, religious,
scientiﬁc, social, and health aspects of the Movement.

Special addresses for children on animal ways and claims have
been given. Mrs. Middleton and Mr. F. E. Cox have also addressed
meetings.

Work for Other Branches and Societies.~—On behalf of
Headquarters and Northern Branches, Mr. Middleton has
organised and lectured in Liverpool, Southport, Bolton, Leigh,
Stockport, Oldham, Blackpool, Preston, Colwyn, WreXham,
Hull, Birkenhead, Wallasey, and various small towns and villages.

Special Campaigns.—Letters and literature have been sent to
Lancashire and Cheshire public representatives, and several
interviews have taken place. .

Resolutions from various meetings have been sent to Govern-
ment Departments and Public Authorities on all aspects of
Research Cruelties and Medical Coercion.

Church and Schools.——-A continuous Educational Campaign
is kept going amongst all denominations. Many clergymen and
teachers are now helping us.

Large numbers are still unaware of the far—reaching evils and
iniquity of vivisection. We owe much to the Rev. H. H. Johnson,
B.A., of Cross Street Chapel, for his vigorous indictment of
Vivisectz'on, Vaccines, and Serums.

Miss C. E. Andrews, of the Church of the New Age, has spoken
out against cruel research experiments.

General Election, l924.——During the election our Northern
Ofﬁce and workers were most. active, all candidates throughout
Lancashire, Cheshire, and the High Peak were questioned, and
electors were notiﬁed of their replies. Correspondence appeared
in the Press.

In Manchester and Salford special attention was given to
political educational work. All our workers are to be congratu—
lated upon their efforts.

Circulation of Literature and Letters.——Large quantities of
leaﬂets and booklets have been effectively circulated from our
Manchester Ofﬁce, and other Northern Centres, this being done
on a regular systematic scale, with personal letters on special
occasions. This involves a vast amount of time and labour, and
many voluntary workers kindly come in to help the Secretary at
these times of great pressure. Splendid service in this way has
been given by Miss H. Turner, Miss Hallowell, Mrs. Platt,
Miss Dorsett, Mrs. Middleton, Miss Jenkins, Mr. Wilson. Mrs.
Heron, Mrs. Cadman, Mrs. Owen, Miss Morris, Miss Powell and
other friends. .

The Event of the Year was the attack upon our revered
President, Dr. W. R. Hadwen, and the bitter persecution and
efforts to ruin and crush him, and, through him, to bring about
the downfall of the Anti-Vivisection Movement.

The Manchester, Salford and District Branch take this oppor-
tunity of expressing sincere appreciation of the splendid help so
generously given by Mr. James Newton, Mr. Edward Newton,
Mr. William Newton, Councillor E. Docker, and a host of friends.
During the Assize Court proceedings, Messrs. J. and E. Newton,
Mrs. Docker, and the Northern Secretary were present in court,
and were able to render service in various ways. The sum of
]£130 5s. was sent from Manchester and District.

Press Work—Letters from Mr. F. E. COX, Mr. V. Wilson,
Mrs. Capper, Miss Hewitt, Mr. Egerton, Miss Hallowell, Miss
Jenkins, the Secretary, and other friends, on various forms of
cruelty, have appeared in many newspapers. We owe special
thanks to the “Manchester City News.”

Co-operation with Various Societies—Many appeals for
help and service are constantly received from various humane
organisations. The British Union workers have responded well,
without in the least neglecting our own special and most difﬁcult
task.

Horse Butchery, Etc.——Your Secretary was requested by
many Manchester people to help in the Horse Butchery Cam—
paign so ably carried on by various agencies. A public meeting
was organised from the British Union Ofﬁce, under the auspices
of the Council for Protection of Animals, of which Miss Hewitt
and Mr. Middleton are Hon. Secretaries. Miss A. M. F. Cole came
specially to speak. She told of British horses being done to
death abroad and even used for vivisection. Mr. J. Cuming
Walters, M.A., presided, and Mr. Rawdon Briggs also spoke.
The meeting attracted much attention and led to good work
being done for the horses.

The Rev. H. H. Johnson, B.A., the well-known minister of
Cross Street Chapel and a Vice-President of the B.U.A.V., spoke
on vivisection at the Welfare Meetings in Manchester during May.
Principal Graham also spoke on vivisection cruelties. This
meeting was arranged by Miss Owen.

Mr. Middleton co—operated with the R.S.P.C.A. in their
Centenary work during 1924, and addressed several meetings in
various places.

Amalgamation,——-Important points have arisen concerning this
question. The Manchester Society, at the request of the British
Union, issued a circular to their members, asking for an expression
of opinion in order to guide the Committee. The result showed a
majority of ten in favour of amalgamation of the two Societies.
A large number of the older member.c are n favour of
amalgamation.

In View of the expressed feeling of the majority of their mem-
bers, supported by the report of their Sub-Committee, we sincerely
,hope that 1925 will witness the complete fusion of the A.V.
forces in Manchester, thus strengthening our Movement, and
leading to efﬁciency and economy.

Finance.——We are again indebted to Headquarters for payment
of ofﬁce rents and rates, and for the grant towards Northern
Branch work. We are desirous of having our own Shop and Van
Campaign, but this will involve a much larger income than at
present.

The generous gift of Miss M. E. Jackson, which was referred to
in our previous report, has been of great service to the Cause.

By means of this special gift we were enabled to do many things
urgently needed, amongst them being the designing and purchase
of British Union Badges. V

People from all parts of the country have written expressing
appreciation of the badge, its design, and price. The ﬁrst 1,000
have cost us £50, and if sold during 1925, will yield a proﬁt of
£20, and accomplish much good for the Movement.

A sum of £ 37 was raised by means of an oil painting, generously
given by Mr. Stamper, R.C.A., in aid of Branch funds. Many
members generously assisted in the sale and purchase of tickets.
Will they please accept our grateful appreciation?

Leaﬂets~,—-Several new leaﬂets have also been issued during
the year. The designing and drafting of the British Union
publications and articles involve much time, care, and thought.
Will members kindly make full use of literature and badges ?

Special N0tice.—Re Addition to Rnles.—%The following rule
was adopted at the Annual General Meeting, April 7th, 1925 :
“No member of less than twelve months’ standing shall be

entitled to vote on questions affecting the Constitution and
Rules of this Branch of the British Union.”

REPORT

Owing to great pressure of work upon our Manchester and
Stockport members, we have not been able to arrange meetings
during 1924. Steady, quiet work has, however, been going
forward.

Mr.~ Middleton has addressed several meetings in Stockport, and
reports have appeared in the Press.

Miss Turner and Mrs. Middleton continue their heavy task of
addressing and circulating the “Abolitionist” and “Animals’
Friend.” Over 400 postal packages are sent out each month for
Manchester and District.

Resolutions on various aspects of vivisection and other cruelties
have been sent to the Press and Parliament.

We desire to express our thanks to Miss F. Kilner and Mr.

Warren for their service in many ways, also to Mr. Wych and '

other friends.

HOW YOU MAY HELP

 

HE Fight against Cruelty can only be won by each one

of us doing our own share in the best and most practical
way. None are too busy to render help, even though it may
be little. The Secretary and Committee will be glad to
hear from friends who desire to assist.

1. Will each friend endeavour to bring in one new member each
year P

.N’

Will members kindly renew their Subscriptions in the early part
of the year, and so save expense of Postal Reminders. Also
notify the Secretary of Change of Address Within one month of
removal P

3. Send a contribution to our Humane Education Van and ShOp
Campaign.

4. Give humane leaﬂets and facts every publicity possible,
especially amongst those who lead, inﬂuence or control public
opinion.

5. Ask your friends to send Articles and Donations to the Children’s,
Horses’, Dogs’ and Cats’ Stalls in connection with our Animal
Lovers’ Fair, and Sale of Work.

6. Ask your Minister, Member of Parliament, Councillors, to speak
out against Cruelty, especially Worn-Out Horse Trafﬁc, Vivi-
section, and the turning adrift of dogs and cats, caging and
chaining of living creatures.

7. If possible, please make arrangements 'for our Speakers to
address Societies, Classes and Public Gatherings, Talks to
Children, etc. (or Group Meetings in friends’ houses).

 

"“The Cause which you are invited to support is a Cause which is twice
blessed. By working to relieve animals from cruel pain and horrible tor-
ture, you not only relieve them, but you elevate mankind. You do more,
you ennoble the great profession which devotes itself to the art of healing.”

——SIR ARTHUR ARNOLD.
