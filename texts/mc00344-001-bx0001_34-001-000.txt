Darwin and the -
Mysterious Mr. X:
New Light on the

EVolutionists

Loren Eiseley, Harcourt Brace Javano-
vich, 1981. Photographslndex. 2 78 pages.
Paper, $6.95. Bk. Service #9180.
With time, the vitality and tex—
ture of the intellectual life of
any era fade from view. Personal—
ities, arguments, and significant

features disappear, leaving only a

general picture. Thus from a dis-
tance of a hundred years, it is easy
to look at natural science in the last
century and see only Darwin and his
controversial theory of evolution.
The service Loren Eiseley renders
“in Darwin and the Mysterious Mr. X is
to give a dynamic overview of the
study of nature in England in the
nineteenth century, one which
makes clear its diversity.

Eiseley, who died in 1977, was
both a scientist and a talented writer.
His aCademic training was in an-
thropology, but his knowledge and
skills Were interdisciplinary. His
great gift, apparent in this book, was
his ability to interpret and com—
municate the world of science to a
wide audience. He gives science a
human dimension, showing evolu-
tionary theorists not only as scien—

 

tists, but also’as men whose involve—
ment with their work was born of a

passionate interest in nature. Their

study is made to seem personal
rather than abstract. _
Central to the book is the idea
that a scientific discovery is nOt the
work of a single person, that Dar—

win’s reputation makes us forget

the work of other men. Eiseley puts
Darwin in perspective, recognizing
both his genius and the fact that,
in. many ways, he was simply the
one to fit the last pieces into the

puzzle to which others had con—‘

tributed over the years. He had
managed to turn them around in the
right light and" fit them together.
Those responsible for the other
endless bits and chunks of discovery

and insight were eventually ob— 4

scured.
The book is a collection of essays,
engaging in their variety, compiled

/

after Eiseley’s death. Several are
devoted to scientists like Sir Charles
Lyell, whose contributions provided
a basis for Darwin’s ideas. Mr. X is
another such contemporary scien-
tist, and his'story is the book’s cen-
terpiece. The mystery man, Edward
Blyth, was even less well known
than Lyell, who, though forgotten
in our day, enjoyed popularity in
his own. Essays about these men
and their time are complemented by 7
selections written by Blyth himself.
These are of interest in light of the
role Eiseley theorizes Blyth played
in the development of Darwin’s
ideas. .

Taken together, the essays make
vivid and concrete an important
period in scientific thought. They
personalize the pursuit of natural
science, without reducing it to the

     

 

- merely anecdotal.

parrot on its perch or an exotic
songbird in its cage is a valued
conversation piece or status symbol.
Few persons know the long and
torturous trail by which exotic birds

get from their native habitats to

perch or cage. Those people who

trade in exotic birds often do so in-

ways that inflict suffering and death.
And, as Konrad LOrenz has noted,
”V’Nobody pities these pathetic crea—
tures in their bell—shaped cages of
martyrdom.’ ” This well-researched,
fully documented and illustrated
account tells what is happening in
the cagebird industry and why.

The Birds Business

A Study of the

Cage birds have become a multi-
million, possibly even a billion dollar

- business. Except for the canary and

budgerigar, most exotic birds sought
by dealers are captured in the wild
and shipped all over the world. The
numbers, it is estimated,‘are a mini-
mum of seven and one-half million

birds annually. The fact that a speCies
. has become rare is no protection for
its members. Instead, rarity makes a
> bird more desirable, and some cus-
tomers will pay fantastic prices fOr
it. Certain Amazon parrots from the

Caribbean, for instance, are now so .

scarce that collectors will pay
- $10,000 or more for one specimen.

The Bird Business traces, on the one
‘ hand, the legal transport of birds—

from their capture in native lands ‘

through way stations, export cities
and quarantine. stations to pet
stores. It also tells about birds that
are smuggled into countries like the
United States and Japan to avoid
inspection and quarantine for diseaSe
or conservation restrictions. And
herein lies tragedy. Birds are con-
cealed in spare tire walls, wrapped in
newspapers, and hidden in ice
'chests. Eighty percent or more of
those birds transported in this way
die from suffocation or heat pros-
tration. Losses simply lead to higher

The Animal Welfare Act at pres—

‘ ent ”does not include cage birds in

its regulations,” and the Lacey Act,
which covers birds arriving at
American ports of entry, is vague
and ineffective. ”Overcrowding, in-
adequate shipping containers, lack

of food or water, or other inhumane-

conditions” are commonplace.

The Bird Business, which first ap-
peared in 1977, is intended to lead to
action. New laws must be enacted,
present laws enforced, and aboVe
all, the public must be educated so
that it will no longer support the
infamous trade through buying
exotic birds or Wishing to see them
on display far from their forest

' homes.

This new version of Greta Nils-
son’s b00k is amply illustrated with
photographs in black and white and
in color. There are pictures ofexotic
birds as they live in the wild and as
captives—in all manner of con—
tainers and conditions. .

II he good observer of nature
holds his eye long and firmly
to the point, as ‘one does when
looking at apuzzle picture.” In this
, collection of thirteen essays, John
' Burroughs follows his own advice.
Originally published in the late
; nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, the essays feature the
Hudson River Naturalist’s meticu—
lous and occasionally poetic obser—
vations. ‘
In ”A Sharp Lookout,” Burroughs,
like Thoreau. before him, recOm-.

A mends that nature be viewed ”from

one’s own spot of earth.” He also
advises against dogmatism, noting
that nature offers ”whole truths,
half truths, and quarter truths.”

‘In two graphic'essays, “The Trag—
edies of the Nests” and ”Bird Ene-
mies,” Burroughs poignantly tells of
the dangers. that beset birds. [He is
particularly harsh in his criticism of
those who collect nests and eggs ”in
the name of science.”

”Winter, like poverty,” Burroughs
writes in ‘. ”Winter Neighbors,”
”makes us acquainted with strange
bedfellows.” This essay and ”Hard
Fare” remind one of the ”Winter
Animals” chapter of Thoreau’s
Walden, but among Burroughs’s
”bedfellows”_ are neighborly downy

    

woodpeckers.

After a difficult winter, comes ”A
Spring Relish,” in which Burroughs
searches in vain for the definitive
beginning to that season. Here he
proves his valuable point that
”Nature will not be cornered.” ‘

Naturalist and poet are fused in
”A Snow—Storm”and”A Salt Breeze.”
In the first, Burroughs (showing the
influence of his friend Walt Whit-
man) refers to ”the tender, sculp-
turesque, immaculate, warming,
fertilizing snow.” In the second, he

.. describes the sea as ”the great can—r

celer, leveler, distributer, neutral-
izer, and sponge of oblivion.” The
sights and sounds of another body
of water, his own Hudson River, are
carefully detailed in ”A River View.”

Sharply reminiscent of Thoreau’s

I The Maine Woods (and as tedious) is

”A Taste of Maine Birch.”In another
detailed essay, ”A Spray of Pine,”
Burroughs comparesthis ”tree of,
silenCe” with the deciduous trees.

An idyllic view of country life is
presented in ”Phases of Farm Life,”
with barn-raising and hay-gathering
among the nostalgic touches. Con— '
tinuing his praise of the simple life,
Burroughs recommends in ”Roof-
Tree” that we build our homes like
nests—”coarse, strong, negative in
tone externally, and snug and well-
feathered and modeled by the heart
within.” . ‘

These essays will provide the
general reader with a good insight
into Burroughs. Barbara Sarkesian

Dear Mrs Stevens

Thank you very much indeed for your most kind letter of the
let April, and for the copy of "The Bird Business".

Charles is a pretty popular name in this country at the moment,
so I'm not at all insultedf! However, if we do a similar
exercise in the future, it would be much appreciated if,

in some position in the book it could say, very small,

"colour section printed in London, England by Edward

Wright Ltd." This is in order to comply with our

laws on the subject.

One small criticism if I may, I think that the book, having
a colour insert, might also have had a colour cover to match,
for extra impact. I‘m a shade disappointed not to have been
asked to produce one.

I'm most pleased that New Delhi seems to have been such a
tremendous success, let us all hope that actions will speak
even louder than words. '

Yours very sincejfly

young ornithologists in the field or providing
delectable dinners in her home for colleagues
and friends.

The passing of Phyllis Barclay-Smith has
marked the end of an era in international bird
conservation which she herself did so much to
foster. We feel that an enduring memorial
should be created to her. We also feel that no
memorial would be more fitting, or give her
more pleasure, than the establishment of a new
headquarters for ICBP, which would be named
after her. The fact that the ICBP Secretariat has
recently moved to Cambridge, the home of her
youth and where she first became interested in
birds, makes this goal all the more appropriate.

To this end it is our aim to raise £50,000 and
we invite all who knew her, cared for her, or
simply want to show their personal appreciation,
to join us and contribute as generously as they
can to our campaign to make this ambitious and
fitting memorial a reality.

A MEMORIAL
APPEAL

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

The International Council for Bird Preservation
suffered a profound 1085 on 2nd January 1980,
with the death of Phyllis Barclay-Smith.

Phyllis had selﬂessly dedicated her life to the
preservation of birds and was universally
recognized as one of the leaders of international
conservation. '

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U

In 1924, early in her life, she became officially
associated with the conservation movement
when she took up work as an Assistant
Secretary to the Royal Society for the Protection
of Birds. In 1935 she became Hon. Secretary of
the British Section of ICBP, beginning the long
association that ran as follows:

1955 as I-Ion. Secretary to the British

Section, until

1936 as Assistant Secretary of ICBP, until

1946 as Hon. Secretary (succeeding Count

Lippens) until

1974 as Secretary General, until

1978 Retired as Vice—President.

In addition to the myriad responsibilities
she undertook for ICBP, Phyllis was active in
several other organisations. She was Vice—
President of The Pheasant Trust, Hon.
SeCretary and Treasurer and later Vice—President
of the-British Ornithologists’ Union, Vice-
President of The Avicultural Society and for
3 5 years editor of its journal, and Hon. Secretary
of the International Waterfowl Research Bureau,
an organisation she was instrumental in
creating.

Phyllis was also one of the first to perceive
the dangers of oil pollution. In 1952, together
with James Callaghan, future Prime Minister of
Great Britain, she created the Advisory
Committee on Oil Pollution of the Sea.

In her capacity as Hon. Secretary of the
Committee, she brought to realization the
International Convention for the Prevention of
Pollution of the Sea by Oil.

Among her many awards and decorations
were seven gold and six silver medals from
various countries. Perhaps she was proudest of
the fact that in 1958 she was singled out as the
first woman to be awarded the Member of the
Order of the British Empire (M.B.E.) for work
in conservation. She was promoted to
Commander of the Order (C.B.E.) in 1970.

In 1973 she was appointed a “Ridder of the
Most Excellent Order of the Golden Ark” by
PrinceBernhard of the Netherlands. I

Phyllis relished her nickname of ‘ ‘ The
Dragon,’ ’ earned by the formidable and
determined exterior that served her so well in
meetings and negotiations. There were,
however, few who knew her who did not warm
to her» generous nature, whether encouraging

Michael W. Fox. 1980. The Soul of the WOlf. (US $ 12.95) Little, Brown
& 00., Boston and Toronto. '

 

The author, Director of the Institute for the Study of Animal Problems,

a branch of the Humane Society of the US in Washington, D.C., is a leader
among the natural scientists who have lately given wolves a good name.
TIME magazine called this book "an illustrated valentine to Fox's four-
footed friends, and a moral message for another endangered Species, man".
Fox insists, man can learn about the mysterious intricacies of nature,
and, thus, be encouraged to cease depradations. In some ways, Fox aVers,
the world would be a better place to live in if pe0ple behaved more like
wolves. .

The flyleaf of the book explains Fox's llessons from the.wolf" as follows:
by discussing the behavioural traits shared by man and wolf, from eye
contact and touch as primary channels of communication to a similar use
of body language to reveal a social hierarchy, as witnessed in the leader
or 'alpha‘wolf and the executive personality, who di8play similarities

in carriage and eye contact. The book is profusely illustrated with de-
lightful photos.

Bernhard Grzimek. 1980. Einsatz fﬁr Afrika - Neue Erlebnisse mit Wild—

Fur das Jahr 2000 rechnet man mit 6'000 Millionen Menschen und fﬁr 2050
sogar mit 10‘000 Millionen. Am schnellsten wachst die Bevﬁlkerung Afri—
kas. Grzimek mochte nur eines erreichen: wenn schon die Menschen immer
~dichter zusammengedrangt leben mﬁssen, dann soll es neben ihnen ausser

in engen Kafigen eingesPerrten Hﬁhnern, Kalbern und Mastschweinen noch
andere Tiere auf unserer Erde geben. Deshalb sollen die Elefanten, Gi-
raffen, Lowen und Gorillas, die Zebraherden in Afrika, dem wildnis—reich—
sten Erdteil, geschﬁtzt werden, folgert Grzimek. In sechs Kapiteln wird
uns diese Tierwelt vor Augen gefﬁhrt, die wir nicht nur nicht vergessen,
sondern auch nie missen dﬁrften. Es braucht kaum hinzugefﬁgt zu werden,
dass das bunte Bildmaterial von aufregender Schﬁnheit ist. Ein wunderscho-

Beobachtung und Erforschung des Tierreichs und des Lebens der Tiere. So

Lemuren und anderen Nachtgeistern, von Drachen, Lindwﬁrmern, Basilisken,

Entdeckung des Quastenflossers Latimeria chalumnae, als wollte er sagen,
damit sei vermutlich das letzte Kapitel derErforschungsgeschichte des
Tierreichs geschrieben worden, soweit es die Wirbeltiere betrifft. Mit
dem Quastenflosser, dem Fisch mit den vier Beinen, wurde der Menschheit

ﬁGreta Nilsson. 1981. The Bird Business - A Study of the Commercial Cage
Bird Trade. (US $ 5.00) Animal Welfare Institute, P.0. Box 3650, Washing-
ton, D.C..‘

The publishers announce this as "the only book which covers the timely

and terrible story of the bird importation trade and the even more hOrrend—
ous smuggling which combine to destroy some of the most beautiful creatures
on earth". The accompanying press release states that at least 792 million
wild birds from trepical Latin America, Asia and Africa are trapped ead1
year for the cage bird market; 40% of these die at capture or on their
journey to export stations; up to 80%.of delicate species and very young
birds die soon after capture. Many of the wild bird survivors will end up
in U.S. pet stores contributing to an annual $ 100 million sales total.

"The Bird Business" traces the movement of wild birds from capture through
way-stations, export cities, quarantine stations to the pet store. It
documents the bird species teetering on the brink of extinction because

of the greed of some dealers and collectors who are willing to pay $ 10,000
or more for rare birds. The book also documents the urgent need to control
the trade in wild birds and confine imports to captive-bred birds. Photo-
graphs — some in colour — feature birds smuggled into the U.S. concealed
in Spare tire wells, wrapped in newspapers and hidden in ice chests, but
also gruesome capture methods. Tables, maps and graphs simplify the text.
There is a list of birds imported into the U.S., 1977-1980, b species as
well as a list of rare and endangered birds, and also excerpt from_guide-
lines for transport and preparation for shipment of live animals and
plants, as agreed upon by the parties to the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora at a conference in
Berne, Switzerland, in 1976.

Time-Life Books, Amsterdam (NL).

In Scandinavia, rock-carvings dating to 10,000 B.C. depict crude harpoons,
'skin boats and whales as well. Whaling had been a part of Basque life from
the late Stone Age. One of the words in their strange language, arpoi,
meaning to grasP or to hold, became the Spanish word arpon, from.which
came the English harpoon. But it were the Yankees of New England who turn-
ed-whaling into a major industry that involved hundreds of ships cruising
the world over. However, the assault on whales reached unbelievable in-
tensity with the employment of advanced technology, that is, with cannon-

“The Miracle of the Fig Treef

 

How To Increase All Your
Plant Growth Up To 91 %

Let's ask Mr. George Maddoc to tell us about “The Miracle of the Fig Tree":

“1 have been a plant food chemist for
over 30 years. Because of this I naturally
gave our little fig tree the very best of
care. After proper fertilizing, watering and
soil preparation the yield was always the
same —— between 50 and 60 figs per
harvest.

THEN I DISCOVERED MMPG

When I first discovered my formula I
sprayed it on the leaves and around the
base of that little tree. My family and I
then left on a five-day trip to the coast.
When we returned I was amazed to find
literally hundreds of little figs had popped
out all over it!

I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY EYES

The harvest from that tree was 544 of
the plumpest, sweetest figs we had ever
tasted! I had cared for that little tree year
after year, but nothing like that had ever
happened before. The branches were
actually bending with the weight of the big,
beautiful figs. It was a miracle!

I TESTED ALL KINDS OF PLANTS

As my excitement grew I couldn’t wait
to try this miracle discovery on everything
that grows. A good friend had a
greenhouse where he grew tomato plants.
When I told him about what had happened
to our fig tree he wanted to spray his
plants with MMPG. To get the most
accurate results possible, we sprayed only
half of his plants.

NOW HE COULDN’T BELIEVE HIS
OWN EYES

The same thing happened! Blooms just
covered the treated half of the plants. They
became weighted down with beautiful,
juicy, delicious tomatoes. At harvest time
the test plants produced 73% more
tomatoes! AND they were bigger, tastier,
and had better color. My friend and I could
hardly believe our own eyes!

THE MMPG FORMULA WORKED

EVERY SINGLE TIME

As I continued testing this “miracle
mist” I was amazed again and again. Not
only did all the plants produce more, but
the fruits and vegetables were bigger,
much tastier, and had more color. By now I
was testing this formula on anything that
was green and growing; both inside and
outside of our house.

OVER THE GARDEN FENCE

YOU PROBABLY WON’T BELIEVE
YOUR EYES EITHER

When you use MMPG you, too, are going
to be amazed. Your house plants are going
to be transformed within days. They will
have colors and vitality that you have
never seen before. Beautiful blossoms of
richness and perfume will adorn your
flowering plants. Your non-flowering
plants will be transformed in just 21 days.
They, also, will have a new look of vibrant
health.

REJUVENATES THE SOIL IN 21 DAYS
Upon contact with the soil this catalyst
activates 4 key cycles:

1. All available nutrients are absorbed
by your plants, precisely. when needed.

2. Your plants mix this rich, new diet
with an increased intake of carbon dioxide.
Plant sugar greatly increases.

3. Friendly bacteria are multiplied many
times over. This powerful army defends
your plants against disease and other
enemies.

4. As beneficial bacteria increase a very

important and unique thing happens: THE'

EARTHWORM POPULATION IN-
CREASES DRAMATICALLY. The soil
around your plants becomes not only
enriched, but areated at the same time.

HOME GROW YOUR OWN SALADS

Results are especially dramatic on
vegetable plants potted in containers ——
bell peppers, tomatoes, lettuce, zucini
squash, cucumbers, onions, green beans
and whatever your taste desires. In fact all
types of garden plants not only thrive in
your home, they help to beautify it. Small
patios can be used to grow an abundance of
healthful, tasty, and economic vegetables.
What a delight to pick fresh salads from
plants that you have grown. ,

THE WHOLE PROCESS IS
TRULY AMAZING

I call this formula exactly what it is:
Miracle Mist Plant Grow (MMPG). It
comes in super-concentrated form; 2
ounces makes 2 full gallons of mixture.

I am now making this miracle formula
available to the public. A 2 oz. bottle of
Super Concentrated MMPG can be shipped
directly to you for only $5. (I pay all
shipping charges). To protect your
purchase I give you the following:

90-DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE:

If you are not completely satisfied in
every way simply return the un-used
portion to me and I will refund your entire
$5 purchase price by return mail plus your
costs for returning it.

NEW TRAP COMBATS ZOONOSES

’ ..

Michael C. Ryan, president of Last-Perch, Inc. ,
Mitchellville, Iowa today announced production
of the company's patented new sparrow trap,
The Last-Perch, designed for use in sparrow-
control programs aimed at reducing zoonoses.

x~ Zoonoses are communicable diseases

 

passed from one animal to another, or passed
from animals to men, women, and children. These diseases include: TGE.
psuedorabies, encephalitis, listeriosis, paratyphoid, pox, tuberculosis,
parasites such as mites, and others.

Citing information received through contacts with authorities such as:
Walter J. Weber, author of the book HEALTH HAZARDS FROM PIGEONS,
STARLINGS, and ENGLISH SPARROWS; and Dr. John B. Herrick, prbfessor
at Iowa State University of Science and Technology; company president Ryan
stated that there are approximately 100 known zoonoses and in many cases,

birds have been shown to act as carriers, spreading diseases to animals and man.

In his book, Weber identified sparrows as being associated with the

(more)

 




 

 
 

LAST PERCH NEWS RELEASE 1 PAGE 2

transmission of over 25 diseases of humans and domestic animals, and nine
viruses isolated from, sparrows.

The common English Sparrow { Passer domesticns ) is not, by law,
protected under the Migratory Bird Act of the U. S. Federal Government. They
were introduced into the United States in 1852, in an attempt that failed to con~
trol the larvae of the linden moth. Due to prolific breeding tendencies, sparrows
now comprise over 70% of the total bird populations in some areas. English
Sparrows mate up to five times per year. Ryan stated that most states have
wildlife laws to protect birds, but they are not consistent or uniform as they
apply to the sparrow problems that plague farm owners and building managers.

In some cases state or local laws require licensing of bird traps, or may
prohibit their use unless authorized by State or local health officials. This has
not restricted sale of Last-Perch traps, however, with sales now quickly spread-
ing throughout rural and urban United States and Canada.

TCE, transmissibile gastroenteritis, which may be carried by sparrows,
is a menace to hog-farming operations in many areas. Cattle, sheep, and poultry
raisers also are affected by diseases, many of which may be spread by birds.

Other diseases, which may affect mankind, horses, dogs, cats, animals etc.
‘ includes, six kinds of encephalitis, acariasis, blastomycosis, cocdidiosis, pox,

BICYCLE LIGHTS

IVIost states require reflectors and lights for nighttime '

riding, and so it is doubly important that your bicycle
lights are seen before it’s too late. To be safe and legal
on a bicycle at night, you must choose lights which catch
the motorist’s attention. Here are my observations of the
good and bad in bicycle lights. The brand names I provide
here should be available in most bicycle shops.

Matex makes two models of “French Arm Light”worn on
the arm or leg. One costs quite a bit and is quite good;
the other doesn’t cost very much and its cost is more
than its worth. The inexpensive version runs on two
“C”cells arranged vertically. Its lenses (clear to the front
and red to the rear) are small and dim, and the on-off
switch is undependable and, after some miles, useless
because the bulb unscrews itself from the vibrations. The
more substantial Matex has a head that will not work
loose, larger lenses front and rear, and a more stable
design (batteries side by side). I like this one.

Soubitez is the best name in generator lights. They offer
several different models, one “block” type for the front
fork (headlight only) and a few sets with a seat stay
mounted generator with head and tail lights. Soubitez
lights are small, dependable, and very good looking. In a
price comparison with the other big manufacturer of gen-
erators, Union (a brand I have used and do not recom-
mend), I found the Soubitez to cost more, but you get
more! I strongly recommend the added expense for a light
you will be proud to put on your bike. It is important to
point out that generators are powered by the bike wheel,
and so the lights go out when the bicycle stops. However,
a positive advantage is that generators never need bat—
teries, making them environmentally superior. (NOTE:
No matter what brand of generator you buy, be sure to
get a rubber cover for the generator wheel so as to reduce
wear and increase bulb life.)

From an ongoing personal survey, I have found that se-
rious cyclists use Wonder Lights more than any others.
Except for the battery-life problem, Wonder Lights have
several advantages. They are easily attached to, or de-
tached from, the bicycle (on the handlebar and seatpost) ,
are lightweight, and have the largest lens of any light
currently available. The light is detachable from its
mounting clip and so is funtional off the bicycle too. Only
Matex is as good in this respect. Wonder has just intro-
duced extra long-life batteries, and rechargeable batteries
that may increase the short life of these lights.

OVER THE GARDEN FENCE (Vol. VIII, No. 2)

When selecting the lighting for your bicycle, consider
whether you want permanent or temporary fixtures, how
long the light must last (around the neighborhood or 40
miles), and what works best for you. Get what you like,
because if you don’t like it, you won’t use it, and someone
will catch you in the dark. I

FLOWERS-for the sheer
joy of it
by Frederick O.Maia
Regional Manager
Joseph Markovits, Inc.

From the earliest records of the culture of Man,
we learn that if people inhabited a place where
flowers were available, the flowers were used as
decorations and played a part in feasts, celebra-
tions and in religious holidays. It is that way
today. Centuries have had their toll on most
customs-but not on how we use flowers.

The floral art has been a recognized art form
for at least a thousand years. According to
Buddhist rites, monks were required to medi-

tate on the spiritual. As a pastime, they deco-

rated their temples with altar flowers honoring
Buddha. Japanese monks developed altar flow-
ers into an art. In the 15th century, the floral
art was formalized. Called Ikebana by the Jap—
anese, the flower arranging art was established

THE CATTLE EGRET-AVIAN PIONEER

by Steve Runnels

Curator of Ornithology

Dallas Museum of Natural History

@1980 OVER THE GARDEN FENCE

One of the most astounding avian success sto-
ries to the ornithologist, today, concerns the
Cattle Egret, Bubulcus ibis. This Old World
species has literally had a population explo—
sion . This is that beautiful white bird often
seen feeding alongside or under the feet of graz-
ing livestock, where it eagerly snaps up insects
during the spring and summer months.

The Cattle Egret is a bird immigrant, conquere
ing every continent (except the Artic, Green-
....... : land and Antarc-
- " tica) unaided by man.
_ Most birds of the world, to-
» da are either static or declin-
ing 1n numbers. However, the
Cattle Egret is greatly ex-
panding and is flourishing
in its range extension.
Since ' the Cattle
Egrets’ success story
is so recent, it pro-
vides an excep-
tional opportu-
nity for docu-
mentation and
study. The
bird also has
a great popu-
larity be-

cause of the close relationship it has established
with man, through its dependent association
with livestock. In fact, some scientists credit
the Cattle Egret’s appetite for horseflies (Ta-
banus sp.) with helping to control bovine ana-
plasmosis, a virulent cattle disease believed to
be spread by horseflies.

The Cattle Egret is an Old World species orig-
inating in Africa. The bird probably got to
South America via an Atlantic crossing of ap-
proximately 1800 miles. It was first observed in
the Western Hemisphere in Surinam, South
America sometime between the years 1877 and
1882. Then, in 1942 it reached the eastern
United States of America via Florida and was
observed to have nested at Lake Okeechobee in
1953. Since that first observed arrival, it has
now spread over most of the United States of
America andinto Canada. The birds were either
blown across in a storm or, possibly utilizing
the north-east trade winds, flew on their own,
stopping at several islands along the way.

In Texas, the first confirmed sighting was on
Mustang Island in 1954. The first breeding re-
cord was in 1958 at Galveston. Since that time
an amazing population explosion has
occurred throughout the State of
exas, and Cattle Egrets are now the
' ost abundant ardeids
(herons and
egrets) in Texas.
The population may
actually be approach-
ing one-half million in
the State of Texas
alone.

Many ornithologists are concerned with the na-
ture of the impact this recent colonizer will have
on the ecosystem. Apparently, it has not dis-
rupted the ecology or crowded out other heron
species, mainly because of its specialized feed-
ing on insects rather than aquatic material such
as fish! The Cattle Egret’s main diet consists of
grasshoppers, crickets, flies (roughly 80%) and,
to a lesser extent, frogs and crayfish (about
20%) . Cattle Egrets are continuing to increase
in numbers because they have no particular
competition in their new habitat, which is a pas-
ture or grassland inhabited by livestock.

These birds are also very successful at produc-
ing offspring. They nest with other herons and
egrets in what is known as a rookery (a nesting
colony of various species). Cattle Egrets have
a long nesting season from April through July.
They have an unusually high tolerance for dis-
turbances which is not true of most birds in
rookeries.

Egrets arrive from their winter quarters in late
March, and by early April courtship begins. It
is at this time that a dramatic plumage change
occurs. As hormones are set in motion, the beak
turns a bright scarlet with a golden tip. Even
the iris in the eye changes from yellow to a
bright red with an inner ring of yellow at the
pupillary opening. Legs also become bright scar-
let. All of these intense colors are set off by the
brownish tan feathers on the back and the beau-
tiful snow white feathers of the body! Both the
males and females undergo thesechanges and
they cannot be distinguished as to sex.

Mating takes place during the nest building,

which is usually a three to six day period. Plat-
form nests are made of stems, sticks, twigs and,
occasionally, reeds. Pilfering material from
other nests is common. Once the nests are com-
pleted and the first egg is laid, they lose their
striking scarlet color and return to their normal
hues. Incubation of the 3-4 eggs is shared by the
pair for a 24 day period; either the male or fe-
male remaining at the nest at all times to ensure
protection from predators. Since the eggs are
laid at two-day intervals, the first born chick
has an advantage over its siblings. Due to this
size difference, usually only two young are
raised when the food supply is adequate. From
a survival standpoint, it is better to raise one
or two healthy individuals rather than three or
four malnourished ones. This seemingly cruel
system is a natural selection process which is
common among most herons and egrets.

Both adults share in the feeding process and by
six weeks of age the young are walking around
limbs surrounding the nest and soon are able to
venture from their nest to secure food on their
own. In the northern habitats, the Cattle Egrets
will usually migrate to warmer climates during
winter.

The next time you are‘ driving down a highway
and see all those beautifulwhite birds feeding

right along withlivestock, remember that those
Cattle Egrets are supplying a previously unful-
filled need, and it is this important ecological
consideration that has provided the basis for,
the rapid spread of the species. The Cattle
_ Egret is definitely a beneficial addition to Amer-
ican avifauna. I

Dear Ms Stevens:
I introduced a Book Review Department in Over The Garden Fence, and I would be

glad to consider for review any books published by the Institute. Enclosed, are
some reviews which are representative of this Department.

°s I would definitely welcome in-depth articles concerning animals teetering on the

brink of extinction. The articles should be written by individuals who are involved
with that particular species and can supply, therefore, a perspective that comes
from an extended involvement with that particular problem.
High quality photographs are encouraged.
Thank you very much for your good letter and I look forward to hearing from you.

THE COMPLETE
BIRDS OF THE
WORLD

by Michael Walters

Birdwatching is now regarded as
one of the fastest growing outdoor
recreational activities in the United
States of America and a book which
lists all the world birds will be au-
tomatically popular.

To the birders who are curious about
the approximately 8700 bird species
in the world, this reviewer can say,
“this book is for you.” It attempts
to list every bird species known to
exist, or to have existed in recent
times. The first division is by family
and then by genus and species. After
each scientific name appears the
English name, if known. Additional
information with each bird includes,
distribution, habitat, food, nest site,
clutch size, incubation time and
fledgling time. This data on some of
the species is incomplete simply be-
cause in many instances it is un—
known!

Michael Walters’ book follows the
sequence of families employed by
J.L. Peters’ Check List of the Birds
of the World, which has been ap-
pearing in sequence since 1930. Re-
grettably, Walters completed his
manuscript before Volume 8 and the
revised edition of Volume 1 of Pe-
ters’ works were published. There is
some disagreement among ornithol—
ogists concerning the sequence of
families employed by Peters’ works,
especially among the passerine
(perching birds) group.

Though several books are currently
available that deal with species of
birds of the world, none contain as
much reference material on each in-
dividual bird as does Michael Wal-
ters’ The Complete Birds of the
World. It is a good reference book
without a lot of technical terms.

FIRST AID AND
CARE OF WILD
BIRDS

Edited by J.E. Cooper and
J.T. Eley

That there is a real and genuine
need for a written guide for the care
of birds such as this book, First Aid
And Care Of Wild Birds, is high-
lighted by the frequent calls I re-
ceive in the spring and summer
months concerning the care of baby
birds. It is surprising how little in-
formation is available concerning
care and treatment of birds, consid-
ering that ornithology is the most
popular of the natural sciences and
further, that more literature is pub-
lished on birds than any other sci-
entific discipline.

The chapter on Birds and Oil Pol-
lution is particularly applicable
since this type of pollution and its
devastating effect on birds is world-
wide. Bird lovers anxious to save
sick or wounded birds will find this
book a valuable reference source.

Veterinarians who may receive the
occasional patient will be interested
in this book. In the appendices are
listed recommended equipment and
medicines, drugs and dosages, prod-
uct list and health hazards to people
working with birds.

Some portions of the book are more
applicable to the United Kingdom,
and would not be pertinent here in
the United States of America. Some
examples include the United King-
dom post office regulations on mail-
ing pathological material, and the
laws issued by the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds In Europe.
However, this book is very helpful
and pertinent in such areas as di-
agnosis of disease, feeding birds,
wounds and injuries and parasites of
birds, to name a few.

This book sagely reminds the
reader,as this reviewer has himself
done many times, that anyone wish-
ing to care for a young bird should
remember that the feeding schedule
is every thirty minutes to an hour
from dawn to dusk for at least two
weeks! It is perhaps not inappro-
priate for this reviewer to mention
that the Federal Law here in the
United States of America states that
“it is unlawful for anyone to kill,
capture, collect, possess, buy, sell,
trade, ship, import or export any
migratory bird, including parts,
nests or eggs, unless the person first
obtains an appropriate Federal Per-

mit”. This does not cover resident
game birds, nor the English Sparrow
or Starling.

This is a book that will prove to be
a ready and helpful reference to
those interested in the subject of
wild birds and their care and treat-
ment.

The History Of The Rose

by Roy E. Shepherd

Roy Shepherd grew some 3,500 roses
in his own garden. One of the roses
which he developed has been
awarded the highest rating for a yel-
low rose of any variety by the Amer-
ican Rose Society. Shepherd initi-
ated a Rose Preservation Project,
collecting and growing many of the
great old roses no longer in com-
merce, and offering budwood'to any-
one wanting to propagate them.

Only in the last sentence of Roy
Shepherd’s Introduction is the ac-
tual scope of the book revealed. “It
is hoped that this compilation of ge-
nealogical and historical data will
add interest to rose growing and
arouse a fuller appreciation of the
efforts of those who, through several
centuries, have worked to create im-
proved roses.” In pOint of fact, this
book does no less than catalogue the
history of all known classes of roses
back to their known beginnings.
That this is actually achieved in Iu-
cid style, permitting easy identifi-
cation of unknown varieties, marks
Shepherd as a master of organiza—
tion, which, in fact, he is!

This book was first published in
1954 and was promptly sold out.
And it remained out of print until
now, when the Earl M. Coleman
Publishers reprinted it by arrange-
ment with The Macmillan Publish-
ing Company, the publishers of the
original edition. The Foreword to
this new edition was written by Lily
Shohan, current Chairman of the
Old Garden Rose Committee of the
American Rose Society, a founder of
the Heritage Rose Group and Ac-
credited American Rose Society
Judge.

And it is here, here in The History
Of The Rose, that this reviewer has
first read of one variety whose cul-
tivation has been encouraged by the
United States Soil Conservation
Service as a living fence to serve as
a buffer in the prevention of erosion
where contour farming is practiced.
The fence is described as “horse
high, bull strong and goat tight,”
providing an attractive and econom-
ical alternative to the institutional
appearing wire fencing. By the time
this book was first published, over
5.00 miles of this rose fencing had
been planted in the State of Ohio

OVER THE GARDEN FENCE (Vol. VIII, No. 1)

alone, Roy Shepherd’s home state.

In Chapter 5, THE FRENCH ROSE
AND ITS RELATIVES, this reviewer
found of special interest, Shepherd’s
observation that, “Due to their me-
dicinal qualities, roses were consid-
ered prizes of war, and herbalists,
who often accompanied invading
armies as physicians, were contin-
ually looking for roses that differed
from those known in their own coun-
tries.” Of course, this respect for the
rose by herbalists was thoroughly
justified, as Shepherd himself points '
out later, referring to the several
hundred tons of rose hips produced
annually, during World War II in
Great Britain, for their Vitamin C
content!

As if to provide a final punctuation
to this detailed and organizational
achievement, the reader is treated
to a Bar Chart which is breathtak-
ing in the beauty of its simplicity. It
is nothing less than a depiction of
the popularity of the various rose
groups over a 350 year span of time!!
The “bars” themselves widening
and narrowing to reflect their vary-
ing popularity over the years. In and
of itself, this chart will continue to
be a valuable reference source.

Roy Shepherd would have been. the
first to confirm that his book is‘but
one chronicle along the way in the
search for the ideal rose. As he tells
us in the very last paragraph of the
book, “This endeavor to describe
and record the history of all known
classes of roses back to their primi-
tive forbears is seemingly a futile
task, for-new types are constantly
being developed. In spite of prog-
ress...there remains an unlimited
field for the improvement of garden
roses.” It is, where Shepherd ac-
knowledges the beauty of nature yet
to be uncovered, as we see him
standing humbly before the task,
and handing on the torch to those
to follow, that we recognize the true 7
master of his craft. .

Dear John,

We are delighted to have the opportunity to stock THE BIRD BUSINESS
by Greta NilsSon. It does indeed present itself well and I hope it
will be well received here. This is in our system for reorder when
stock declines to two copies. I will make an effort to keep my eye
on it as well. The book will be stocked here on a top shelf in sec-
tion thirty together with our other offerings in the area of Bird
study. Our purchase order is enclosed. Please send four copies to
my attention but bill for five as we have already stocked the sam-
ple copy you kindly dropped off. We will accept these books on a
non-returnable basis. In the distant future, should we decide to
discontinue the book, we will simply make it down. This will be easier
for all of us.

It certainly is a pleasure to hear from you. I hope to see you be-
-fore too much more time passes.

Dear Mrs. Nilsson:

I am writing at the suggestion of Mr. Wade Ritchie, of the USDA staff
of Foreign Quarantine, if I could obtain a c0py of a book you have
recently completed, titled ”Bird Business." I understand that this
book has documented the numbers and types of birds imported into the
United States over the past several years.

I would like to get this reprint to help with our problem with diseases
in these birds after quarantine such as psittacosis. If there is a

charge, please let us know what it is.

Sincerely,'

Special to The Washington Star

Christmas 15
Special Here

Christmas in.Wash-
ington is Special -- all
who live here, long
enough realize. A
Washington
Christmasyhas an ins
ternational flavor.
Many families from
.all over the world ,
have brought with them their
Christmas customs that further enrich
our already rich heritage.

A Washington Christmas can have
a political aspect. While most 0f Con-
gress and the president sometimes go
home, many families stay behind, and
our own political hierarchy lives here.
Add to theseedescendants of families
who have been here for generations.
There are even local traditional
Christmas parties. '

Several held this week. and being
held today, tomorrow and the rest of
this week will illustrate our
uniqueness. _ '

The Raymond Postons and. their
four handsome children had open
house from 2 until 9 pm. yesterday
in their magnificently decorated El-
licott Street residence. Gretchen Pos-.

. ton, for four years as social secretary
to the White House, has been respon-
sible for state dinners and other func-
tions at the executive mansion. This
year the Christmas tree‘of silver lace
and angels was a Poston dream. She
said of her own efforts at home, “It‘s
Posion decorated. We do it for families;
everyone'brings‘ heir children, their
relatives. It’s Christmas.”

Bachelor lawyer Steve Martindale,
who never went back to his home in
Poca’tello, Idaho, (to live) rents the
handsome Dexter Street home of for-
mer Sen. and Mrs. Mike Mansfield.
The Mansfields are in Tokyo for
Christmas, where he is US. Ambassa-
dor: '

Martindale went all out for his
Christmas party Tuesday. Fir trees and
bushes on the corner lot. were bright
with strings of clear bulbs. Figures
of caroling. children lined the walks.
Inside there was a tree, poinsettias
and a creche.

The guests were representative of
a Washington Christmas: Former May-
or and Mrs. Walter Washington, Sen.
and Mrs. David Pryor (D-Ar‘k.), de-
feated Sen. Gaylord Nelson, Anne Wex-
ler (soon to be out of a job as assistant
to the president), Wexler’s husband,
Joseph Duffey (whose term as head
of the National Endowment for the
Humanities runs until next Novem-
-- Re. and Mrs. “Bill Frenzel of

Minnesota. Ruth Frenzel, when asked
what she was doing in town at this
time, answered, “Christmas is person-
al. I only want to stay home and cook.”
Adding an international flavor to
the Martindale party were Belgian Ani-
bassador and Mrs. Raoul Schoumaker,
Dominican Ambassador and Mrs. En-
riquillo del Rosario, Cyprus Ambassa-
dor and Mrs. Andrew Jacovides and

Malaysian Ambassador and Mrs. Az-g

raai Zain.

Sen. a

There were permanent Washington-
ians at Martindale’s, including Oatsie
Charles, the Martin Agronskys, ”the
Doug Kikers and Evangeline Bruce,
the Roger Stevens and the new pow-
erhouse, Sen.and Mrs. Strom Thur-
mond. . .

Nuevo Mundo, the ultra chic
Alexandria boutique that sells clothes
and jewelry and accessories, included
the Thurmonds in’a verse in their
Christmas cards, which read: “Fun
couples are now Strom and Nance, And

also John and Liz, With Nancy Reagan .

as the star, A Mrs, not a Ms. For Laxalt,
Deaver, Meese and Will, The hostesses
now clamor, The White House. is
emerging as The bastion of Glamour.

Nuevo Mundo in its heart will miss

our little Amy, And keep her in our
fondest thoughts along with Bird and
Mamie.” -

Animal lover and. ecologist
Christine Stevens’ Christmas card was
a plea for her beloved birds. “Please
do not cut down our tree-s. Please do
not steal our nestlings. Please do not
drug them, hide them, smuggle them.
Leave us alone."

Anne Mansfield Marris and her hus-
band, British economist Robin Marris,
will give a Christmas party tomorrow,
in their Cleveland Park home.

Boxing Day, a British public hol‘i- ‘
day, is also an extension of Christmas.
It began with the distriﬁp‘ution of

“Christmas boxes to. employees. ,

British Am‘bassador Sir Nicholas

,. Henderson and Lady Henderson are

also celebrating Boxing Day with a
party and reception at the embassy.

1,3 't t

Tonight in their Georgetown home,
the Henry Kissingers are giving what
a’ secretary described yesterday as
“their very priVate annual traditional
Christmas supper for 50 or more ,close
friends.” . .

At the Walter Ridders’ annual
Christmas party Tuesday many of their
guests left their cars a considerable
distance from the icy hill leading up
to the Ridders’ house overlooking the
Potomac. . ‘ ,

The Ridders’ sprawling Christmas
bedecked home was filled With family
friends and neighbors, including the
Elliot Richardsons and the Edward P.
Morgans. The Ridder party follows an
almost exact format —- a divine supper,

enthusiastic caroling, sedate adult

dancing and infinite rock and roll.

t ﬁ-t t

On Capitol Hill Monday,‘Lu Engle,
Widow of the late senator from Califor-
nia, gave her also very traditional
Christmas party. , -

Engle’s tall townhouse on Capitol
Hill takes her days to decorate with
tender loving care. Hours go into deco-
rating the tree, which touches the tall ‘
ceiling. Hours must also be spent on
a ladder to hang the ornaments from
the oversized chandeliers that center
the double drawing room.

Further hours are spent in prepar-
ing the bountiful Christmas feast,
which covers the long table in the
festooned dining room where
presidents including Jack Kennedy, -
Lyndon Johnson, Gerald Ford and
their wives have dined. Polly Logan,
the Tom Kellys, Ceci Moran, Mrs.
Douglas Hatch, the Robert Mont-‘
gomerys, the Leonard Marks, Hope
Miller and dozens more who are al-
ways at ’Engle’s‘ were back this year.
Coming and going everywhere, the
words “Merry Christmas” filled the air;

555) LIVER FLUKE DIAGNOSTIC TEST

 

The world's first diagnostic test for liver fluke in cattle has been
developed. The new test should make finding a cure for fluke easier by
quickly and reliably determining whether or not cattle are infested with
liver fluke.

Liver flukes, Fabcioﬂa hepatica, are parasitic flatworms that infest
and feed on bovine livers. There is no treatment currently available in
the United States for fluke, which costs the cattle industry millions of
dollars in livers condemned at the slaughterhouse, plus losses from
reduced milk production and calf growth each year.

Until the new diagnostic test, the only way to detect fluke infesta—
tions has been to place cattle feces in water and search for fluke eggs——
a time-consuming and inaccurate method.

SEA microbiologist David Shen and Carla Farrell, a scientist with
Washington State University, both at Pullman, Washington, developed the
new test, which, in addition to diagnosing for fluke, should also enable
researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed fluke treatments.

The basis of Shen's and Farrell's test is a protein-detection tech—
nique used in human and plant disease research called ELISA, which stands
for enzyme—linked immunosorbent assay (Agricultural Research, April 1978,
pg. 13). Using ELISA, a specimen of blood or serum is placed in a color-
less enzyme solution. If a suspect protein, such as a virus or an antibody,
is present in the specimen, the enzyme solution turns to a specific color.

Shen and Farrell are believed to be among the first to adapt ELISA
to animal disease research. Currently, they are working on developing
an ELISA diagnostic test for equine infectious anemia in horses and dis-
temper in dogs.

Drs. David Shen and Carla Farrell are located at the Veterinary Science
Building, Dept. of Vet. Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State
University, Pullman, Washington 99l64.--By Lynn Yarris, SEA, Oakland, CA.

556) THE VETERINARIAN AND REGULATIONS

 

The first question many ask is why do we have regulations, or if
they don't ask that question, they ask why there are so many and why are
they so strict. Both are good questions and this article will address
itself to them.

Regulations are necessary for orderly, coordinated disease control,
not only within your own state but also within the United States and
throughout the world.

Historically speaking, we have to only mention the disease of tuber—
culosis to show how coordinated efforts of state, federal, and local reg—
ulations and cooperation of veterinarians with these regulations have
almost eliminated this disease. On the other hand, brucellosis is-still
with us and will remain so until all government agencies agree to a
proper regulation and until an all—out effort is made with veterinarians
and livestock owners agreeing and abiding by such regulations to stamp
out this disease.

As the disease picture and movement of livestock changes, new
regulations must be put into effect and enforced to stop the spread of
new diseases and to eradicate this threat to the livestock industry and,
sometimes, to human health.

It is impossible to write and enforce a regulation that is fair to
absolutely everyone. It parallels writing a tax law; it just cannot be
100 percent fair to every segment. At least some portion will be more
stringent on one segment of the industry than it is on the other segment.

To find out the strengths and weaknesses of regulations, one must
first ascertain the industry's need and then put this need into the form
of a regulation. Promulgate this regulation and put it into effect and
then, after a reasonable period of time, reassess your action and make
the necessary change to make it more workable or more enforceable to
accomplish the goals of the regulation. This takes input from the indus—
try, veterinarians, and regulatory personnel.

If you, as a veterinarian, find problems with a given regulation, or
your clients seem to be having problems with either the content or intent
of a specific regulation, talk it over with other veterinarians or clients
that are affected by this regulation. Then, if you find you would like
to see specific changes made, contact either the state veterinarian
directly or any of the nine appointed persons that represent you on the
Board of Animal Health (in Indiana). This will be brought to the entire
board's attention. If justification for a change exists, then a majority
vote of the board can change a regulation.

It does no good to complain to other channels. Only a direct com—
plaint as outlined above will help you get a regulation changed or modified.

The proper frame of mind—-knowing that we must live with some degree
of control and that we can help control disease by cooperating with each
other—-will make everyone's load and work lighter. Purdue Vet. Notes,
No. 119, June 1980.

 

557) LIGHTNING DEATH DIAGNOSIS IN CATTLE

 

Diagnosis of lightning death: In addition to considering circum—
stantial evidence, recent storm, hair burns, and absence of struggle-—
check the trachea. Most cattle victims of lightning have a large, rope—
like blood clot within the trachea. This results from the violent con—
traction which ruptures large pulmonary vessels.—-B.N. Frank, D.V.M.,
Sterling, Colorado, as reported in Veterinary Medicine Newsletter, May 1980,
University of Florida.

 

558) GOAT MEDICINE: MINI-CAPSULES

 

. Goat's teeth need to be checked frequently and often will require floating.

. Lanolin applied to the legs of billy goats reduces urine scald.

. Demodectic mange and ringworm are common skin problems.‘

. Conformation is a major factor in the incidence of mastitis in goats.

. Dave Church's book is a good reference on nutrition of the goat.

. Descenting bucks imﬁairs reproduCtive performance.

. RompunR or Ketamine are best administered I.V. to achieve more consist—
ent induction and recovery periods.

. Pregnant nanny goats frequently manifest estrus periods.

. Breed every 12 hours while doe is in heat.

. Considerable success can be obtained if you use A.I. on good production—
tested does.

. Do not breed polled goats to polled goats. This mating will produce
about 35 percent pseudohermaphrodites.

. Estrus synchronization does work in goats. Running does with bucks
causes most to breed out of season.

. Dry off does 60 days before they are due to freshen; just stop milking
to dry off. You may reduce the feed intake, but do not withhold water.

. Use dry cow mastitis treatment on only those does that have udder trouble.

. Teat dipping is advised for the first few days after kidding.

. Chlamydial infection is the most common cause of abortion, pinkeye, and
polyarthritis.

This section of the FEDERAL REGlSTER
contains notices to the public of the
proposed issuance of rules and »
regulations. The purpose of these notices
is to give interested persons an
opportunity to participate in the rule
making prior to the adoption of the ﬁnal
rules. -.

 

 

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE _ :

Service

Importation of Animals ~

AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service, USDA.

ACTtort: Proposed rule.

 

SUMMARY} Thisdocume‘nt proposes to
provide additional grounds and’revise
the procedures for the withdrawal or
denial of approval ofa commercial bird
quarantine station. The intended effect
of this action would be to terminate the
Department’s approval or to refuse
approval of such facility when certain
persons that operate or are responsibly
connected with the business 0f the
facility are determined to be unfit to
engage in such business. This action is
being proposed because it is believed .
that the present procedures may not be
adequate to insure the proper operation
of quarantine facilities involved in the
importation of_certain birds. ‘

DATE: Comments on or before January
19. 1981. I

Aoanss; Written comments to Deputy
Administrator, USDA. APHIS, VS, Room

Federal Building, Room 815, Hyattsville,
MD curse, 301—435—8170. The Draft
Impact Analysis describing the options
Eonsidered in developing this proposed
rule and the impact of implementing
each option is available upon request
from Program Services Staff, Room 870,
FBderal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road,
Hyattsville. MD 20782, 301—436—8895.
SUPPLEMENTARY msoenanom This
Preposed action has been reviewed
Wider USDA procedures established in
_ Cretary's Memorandum 1955 to
1mPlement Executive Order 12044, and
33, been classified “not significant."

Notice is hereby given in accordance i
with the administrative procedure
provisions in 5‘U.S.C. 553, that, pursuant
to Section 2 of the Act of February 2,
1903. as amended; and sections 4 and 11
of the Act of July 2. 1962 [21 USS 111. ..
1340, and 134i), the Animal and Plant ’*
Health Inspection Service is considering ”
amending Part 92. Title 9, Code of ‘
Federal Regulations. . '

On Tuesday, October 30. 1973, there
was published in the Federal Register
(38 FR 29882729885) an amendment of
the regulations in 9 CFR Part 92 which
would allow the importation of
commercial birds under specified
conditions, including a requirement of '
quarantine in facilities approved by the
Deputy Administrator, Veterinary
Services, and a requirement that the

‘ birds be handled during quarantine in

accordance with pfocedures prescribed
by the Deputy Administrator, Veterinary
Services. '

Presently, § 92.11(ﬂ(6) of the .
regulations provides that before a
decision is made with respect to the
eligibility of any facility for initial
approval, a personal inspection of the
facility shall be made by a Veterinary _
Medical Officer of Veterinary Services,
to determinewhether it complies with
the standards outlined in this section.
Approval of any facility may be refused
and approval of any approved
quarantine facility may be withdrawn at
any time by the Deputy Administrator,
Veterinary Services, upon his,
determination that any requirement of
this section is not being met. Before such
action is taken, the operator of the
facility will be notified of the proposed
action and the reasons for it and upon
request, be afforded opportunity to be
heard thereon.

Recent events, including the misuse of ~
approved quarantine facilities to import
birds illegally into the United States by
some operators of such facilities, have
provided the Department with evidence
that the administrative prohedure of
§ 92.11(f){6) may not be adequate to
insure the proper operation of approved
commercial bird quarantine facilities.
This is particularly true when persons
connected with the conduct of the
business of the facility are convicted of
a crime under any law concerning the

' importation or quarantine of any animal,

including poultry or birds, or of any
crime involving fraud. bribery. extortion
or any other crime indicating a lack of

integrity needed for the conduct of
operations affecting the importatitm of .
commercial birds. research birds, or '
zoological birds. The integrity of the

individuals involved in the operation of

an approved quarantine facility is of
vital importance to insure the proper
handling of quarantined birds. Such

‘ birds represent a potential to introduce

communicable animal diseases into the i
United States if not properly handled.
Consequently. it appears that if the
operator. or a person responsibly
connected with the business of an
approved quarantine facility or a facility
for which approval is being sought,
commits or has committed the
aforementioned crimes, such person
demonstrates an unfitness to engage in
the importation of birds through an
approved quarantine facility. ‘

Due to the Department’s limited
ampunt of resources to service approved
quarantine facilities, it appears to the
Department that it should not allocate
services to a facility which has persons
associated with it who have been
determined to be unfit to engage in the
bird importation business because of
their conviction.

A person would be deﬁned to include
any individual, corporation, company,
association, firm, partnership, society or ‘ ‘
joint stock company.

An operator would be deﬁned as any
person operating a quarantine facility.

A person "responsibly connected”
would be defined as a partner, ofﬁcer,
director, or a holder of 10 per centum or
more of voting stock, or an employee in
a managerial or executive capacity of
such facility. Such a person would be in~
a position to exercise direct control over
the Operations of anapproved ’ /
quarantine facility, and, therefore, such .
person's integrity Would be critical to
the proper operations of the facility.

Before withdrawal of approval or,
refusal to approve a facility, the
Operator of the facility or the applicant
for approval would be notiﬁed of such‘
action and the reasons for sucli action.
The notification may be given orally or
in writing; however, if it is oral, it would
be confirmed in writing as soon as
circumstances allow. An opportunity to
answer the allegations and challenge
such action would be afforded to the
affected person, together with an
opportunity for a hearing, when .
requested, with respect to the merits or
validity of the action. Rules of pracilCe

Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 226 / Thursday, November 20, 1980 / Proposed Rules

 

would be adopted for the particular
proceeding. The withdrawal of approval
would be effective immediately pending
a ﬁnal decision in the aforementioned
proceeding when the Deputy,
Administrator determines that such
action is necessary to protect the public
health, interest or safety. The -
withdrawal would be effective
immediately upon oral or written ‘

, notification, whichever is earlier, to the

operator of the facility. In the event of
oral notification, written conﬁrmation
would be provided. The withdrawal of
approval would remain in effect for the
duration of any hearing and
administrative and judicial review of the
proceeding, unless otherwise ordered by
the Deputy Administrator. As noted
above, quarantined birds represent a
pot‘éntial to introduce communicable
animal disease into the United States if
not properly handled. Therefore,
immediate termination of approval may
be necessary if the risk is too signiﬁcant
to permit the birds‘to be entrusted to a

person convicted of the types of crimes ‘_

speciﬁed. Further, some crimes may
involve violent crimes, and the
Department does not believe its
employees should have to be exposed to
risks involved in working with persons
who have committed violent acts. These
procedures are believed adequate to
insure due process of the affected
persons. I -

The regulations would provide, _ .
however, that if a convicted person is . ’
"responsibly connected" with the
business of the facility and his,
relationship'with the facility is
terminated after issuance of a complaint
and receipt of notification, and the .
operator of the facility enters into and
complies with a consent agreement in
which it is agreed that the previously "
responsiblyconnected person is not and
will never be associated with the
approved quarantine facility, the
conviction of such responsibly
connected person would not by itself
. constitute grounds to withdraw approval
of the quarantine facility. Additionally,
violation of the consent agreement *3 ,
would constitute.independent'grounds
to withdraw approval of an approved
quarantine facility. These procedures
respecting responsibly connected
persons are proposed because it appears
that there may be situations in which
the operator of the facility is unaware ’of
or not involved in the wrong doing of the
, responsibly connected person, and
consequently, should be afforded an ,
opportunity to receive or continue to
receive services from the Department.
However. the continuation of services
would be contingent on the termination

 

of the responsibly connected person ’
with the quarantine facility. This
exception has not been proposed for a
cenvicted operator because the
regulations presently require that the
operator of the facility enter into a
cooperative agreement with the
Department and to the extent that the
operator changes, the new operator
would be required to enter into a
cooperative agreement and seek
approval if he/she wanted to operate an
approVed quarantine facility. As noted
above, the Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS) has a limited
number of resources, including
personnel, which may be allocated to
servicing approved quarantine facilities.
Consequently, it is believed
undersirable from a policy standpoint to
allocate services to such convicted
operators of a facility who have .
demonstrated by their conviction their
unﬁtness to engage in the’bird ,,
impurtation business. '

Accordingly, Part 92, Title 9, Code of
Federal Regulations, would be amended
in the following respects:

In § 92.1, new paragraphs (X) and (y)
would be added to read:

§ 92.1 Definitions.

2. In § 92.11(f)(6], the first sentence '

subparagraph (f)(5) of this section, and

paragraph (mo) would be amended to .. .

read: ‘

(6)(i) Approval of any facility may be
refused and approval of any approved

any time by the Deputy Administrator,

reasons provided in paragraph.(f)(6)(ii)
of this section. Before such action is ‘
taken’, the operator of the facility will be
informed of the reasons for the proposed
action and, upon request, shall be
afforded an opportunity for a hearing
with respect to the merits or validity of
such action, in accordance with rules of
practice which shall be adopted for the
proceeding. However, such withdrawal

circumstances permit. This withdrawal
shall continue in effect pending the
completion of the proceeding and any
judicial review thereof, unless otherwise
ordered by the Deputy Administrator.

(ii) Except as prowdedjn paragraph

DrV.S.S. Richeson, Deputy Administrator
USDA, APHIS, vs

Federal Building, Room 815

Hyattsville, Md. 20782

Dear Dr. Richeson,

The Society for Animal Protective Legislation endorses the
rule that the approval of a commercial bird quarantine facility
may be denied if any partner, officer, holder or owner of ten
per centum or more of the voting stock or any employee in a

‘managerial or executive capacity is or has been convicted of any

crime involving fraud, bribery or extortion or any other crime
involving a lack of integrity. However, we feel strongly that it
is vital that this stipulation be further extended to cover all
employees of a facility. If any staff member is convicted of a
crime or has a criminal record, he should not continue as an
employee or be hired in any capacity thereby giving him an op-
portunity to engineer or be party to any malfeasance. Standards
for employment must be of so high a caliber that the likelihood‘
for criminal action by any staff person be kept as low as pos—
Sible. The regulations should be changed to omit the qualifi-
Cation " in a managerial or executive capacity" and to make clear
that all employees and all persons financially connected with

the business must have a clean record.

I

Sincerely.

Dear Christine

Many thanks for your letter of 9th October. I am sorry that it has taken
me so long to reply to this but I have been very tied up in a European
bird protection conference in Malta.

This office at the RSPB would be delighted to hold stocks of Greta's
book for distribution to anyone who wrote to us, and we would give the

“Mpppk a rev1ew in our maga21ne I think, but I do not think we could enter

into a very active distribution since we are not really geared up for
this task. Since we, I think, with the exception of about 10 copies
which we might send free, would require persons who wish to have the
booklet to pay for it, I do not think there would be a huge demand and
probably 100 copies would be the outside maximum. We certainly would
not want to commit ourselves to a 100 initially but merely call—off
copies, perhaps 10 or 20 at a time.

I quite see that this possibly does not meet with what the Institute

would envisage for the distribution of this extremely valuable book

and if you wished to approach others who might be in a position to promote
the book more actively, please feel free to do so. I am not sure what

form the book would take, but if it was perhaps more saleable it would

be worth approaching a commercial publisher who has established outlets

in this country which we ourselves do not have.

Please do not hesitate to get in contact with me if you would like to
have any further information.

Yours sincerely
