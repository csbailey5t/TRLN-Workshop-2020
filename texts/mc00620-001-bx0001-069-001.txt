THE NEW ENGLgAND
Anti—Vivisection Society

was organized March 30, 1895, by physicians,
lawyers, clergymen, and prominent citizens
for the ultimate abolition of the practice of
Vivisection.

What is Vivisection?

Vivisection is the so-called “ scientiﬁc ” ex-
perimentation upon living animals. It in-
volves every species of torture, and is largely
done Without the use of anzesthetics.

0111' Object.

The immediate object of this Society is to
Expose and to Oppose. Its methods will be
by personal effort and inﬂuence, through the
press and from the platform, by the distribu-
tion of literature, and to eventually advocate
legislative prohibition of this cruel and useless
practice.

Why we oppose Vivisection.

First and principally, we oppose Vivisection
upon moral grounds. This practice strikes at
the ﬁrst principles of right and justice.

Although instances occur Where, in experi-
mentation, the demands of humanity are




observed, the system as a whole is one of
cruelty. It is the terrible possibilities of a
practice that should condemn it. Our proofs
are the acknowledgments of the experimentors
themselves and the testimony of reliable
witnesses.

We believe that the end does not justify the
means, and that if cruelty to a human being
is wrong, cruelty to 'a helpless animal is worse
because more cowardly.

We consider cruelty for the sake of scientiﬁc
gain as culpable as cruelty for the sake of.
mercenary gain; and ignorant brutality quite
as justiﬁable as scientiﬁc brutality.

Secondly, we oppose Vivisection because it
is impractical. This fact is proven by many
of the highest medical and other scientiﬁc
authorities, who testify that this practice is
not only useless but misleading.

All persons who recognize and appreciate
the necessity and importance of this humane
work, and who are in sympathy with the
above methods, are cordially invited to honor
the Society and aid the cause by identifying
themselves with the movement by becoming a
member, by contribution, or by co-operation.
