Dear Mrs. Moore:

Thank you for your letter expressing your opposition to any
legislation which would transfer to the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare the responsibility for insuring the
humane treatment of laboratory animals.

I share your interest in the humane care of laboratory animals,
and if the Rogers-Iavits bill should be considered again this
year, I will certainly study it carefully. I agree that we should
avoid any legislative action which might set a lower standard
than that provided in PL 89-544.
