SLAUGHTER OF HORSES

In expressing satisfaction with the recently pub'
lished Recommendations of the Committee of
Inquiry into the Slaughter of Horses (Chairman,
His Grace the Duke of Northumberland), the
RSPCA recalled that the terms of reference of
the Committee were:

‘to consider the law and the practice thereunder
relating to the slaughter of horses in slaughter;
houses and knackers’ yards and to recommend
whether any further safeguards should be
introduced to ensure the humane slaughtering
of horses in this country’.

The RSPCA went on to repeat its regret that
the terms of reference were not wider, so that the
Committee could have dealt effectively with the
matter of the import of horses from Eire and
Ulster. '

With this reservation the RSPCA welcomed
the. recommendations and is particularly pleased

with the recommendation that no live horse-

should be sent to a knacker’s yard.

~ The RSPCA will now make it its duty to urge
upon the Government that the recommendations
of the Committee be implemented without delay.

Recommendations

The following is a summary of the Committee’s
recommendations:——‘ ‘ '

(1) That the Food and Drugs Act and other
relevant legislation dealing with the licensing of
slaughterhouses be amended to provide that the
grant or renewal of a licence to use premises as a
horse slaughterhouse should be subject to the
premises complying with minimum standards pre—
scribed in regulations and that the Slaughter of
Animals Acts be amended to afford the Minister
of Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland
powers to make regulations prescribing minimum
standards of construction and equipment for
slaughterhouses and lairages (para. 112).

(2) That section 57 of the Food and Drugs
Act, 1938, and the corresponding legislation
pertaining to London and to Scotland be amended
to provide for the licensing of premises for the
slaughter of horses for hUman consumption to
make illegal the slaughter of horses for human
consumption at premises not so licensed (para.
113).

(3) That the law relating to the licensing of
slaughterhouses be amended to provide for the

OIL POLLUTION

Guillemots, razor bills and one lone seagull
were among the 108 oiled sea birds rescued
recently by Inspector Ambrose and his helpers
from the North Devon Coast.

The exact number Of birds who suffered as a
result Of this Oil pollution will never be known
(reports the Inspector) for some Of the birds
possibly drifted far away and others found dead
were buried by local people and holiday makers.

Of the 108 birds rescued by the RSPCA and
its helpers 38 died and 29 were beyond all help
and had to be given a humane end.

RSPCA Inspectors had the satisfaction of
saving the lives Of no less than forty—one birds.
These. responded to cleaning and ﬁrst—aid
treatment and were released on Oil free
beaches.

The ﬁrst news. Of this extensive Oil pollution
reached Inspector Ambrose whilst he was on

duty at Stibb Cross Grading Centre one Monday
morning. An AA Patrol Scout told him that a
holiday maker on the beach at PutsborO had seen
guillemots covered in Oil washed ashore. The
Inspector at once motored tO Croyde and found
the holiday maker doing all he could tO alleviate
the suffering Of the birds.

The Inspector took the birds who were still
alive tO his home at Barnstaple and there set
about giving first aid and cleaning them. By this
time he began to receive reports Of guillemots
found helpless on the sands at WOOlecombe,
Croyde and Westward HO, so he set out again
from beach tO beach collecting the birds and
taking them home. He had already set up emerr
gency measures at his home, but needed more
help and telephoned Headquarters who drafted
Inspector Pickett Of Exeter intO the district.
Together the two Inspectors visited every beach
from Ilfracombe tO Bucks Mills—thirty tO forty
miles Of coast line.

I collect pets and deliver them to a man at
Stepney.’

Upstairs were found two boxes containing
eight cats.

Counsel added that a quarter of an hour before
midnight on the previous day a man was looking
out of his bedroom window and saw the defen—
dant standing at the corner of the street. With
him were two women.

The witness saw one of the women bend down
and offer to cats in the road what appeared to be
a bit of ﬁsh. He then saw her pick up one of the
cats. Thinking it was his own he shouted. The
cat was dropped and ran away.

‘Sold for Research’

Asked whether he could say the destiny of the
cats, the Police Sergeant, who was a witness in
the case, replied that he understood the defen—
dant was going to sell them to a dealer.

‘I visited the dealer,’ he continued. ‘This dealer
advertises for cats and in a yard at the rear of his
house he had sixty cats and 100 rabbits. He told
me that he sells them to research centres.’ '

The deputy chairman told the defendant:
‘Acute distress must have been caused not only
to children, but to men and women. I am told
that you hoped to dispose of the cats as pets.
Were it not for your hitherto good character
I most certainly would have passed a sentence of
imprisonment.’

(As well as helping the Police to bring the
defendant in this case to justice, the RSPCA looked
after the cats whilst the case was pending and was
able to have the cats identiﬁed. This was important
to the Police as it helped to make prosecution for
stealing possible.)

HEROES’ CORNER

GOAT RESCUED

Once again members of the Upper Wharfedale
Rescue Association have come to the help of an
animal in distress. This time it is a goat who was
on a ledge sixty feet down at Loop Scar, Burnsall,
Yorks. The crag was sheer and below rushed the
River Wharfe in full spate made treacherous by
rocks and Whirlpools. Mr R. W. Goodwin volun—
teered to descend. When he had reached the
animal he was hauled up by his colleagues holding
her in his arms for part of the way and when a
wider ledge was reached the rope was passed
round the goat who was hauled alone to safety.
The man followed using the same method.

The owner of the goat said that a second goat
was missing and Mr Goodwin, despite the failing
light, descended again though his search was
unavailing. For his gallantry he has received a bar
to the RSPCA Bronze Medal he already holds.

AND A DOG

Mr W. Joint and Mr Gainswin have each re«
ceived the RSPCA Bronze Medal for their gallanv
try in rescuing a dog from a mine shaft at Owlav
combe, near Ashburton, South Devon. The'two
men entered an adit on a lifeline which they Sub?
sequently discarded. By dint of wriggling on their
stomaches they ultimately reached the bottom of
the shaft where they found the dog. Unfortunv
ately the dog had died as a result of the severe
injuries received when falling down the shaft.

 

THIS DOG HAD DIFFICULTY IN STANDING ON HIS
BACK LEGS

 

Senior Inspector Waite, giving evidence against a
man and woman brought by the RSPCA before
the magistrates at Watlington, said that when he
approached, the dog barked and staggered.» ‘The
whole of its skeleton,’ he said, ‘Could be seen
through the skin. . . .’

To a plea from the male defendant that he had
not the money to buy food for the dog, nor the
heart to have it put down, the Chairman of the
Bench said: ‘You had the heart to see it starveto
death at the end of a chain!’ ’ ‘ ‘

Both defendants (who were charged with
causing the dog unnecessary suffering by neglect).
were sent to prison—the man for threemonths
and the woman for twenty—eight days. The man
was ordered to pay £8 83. costs. Both were dis,—
qualiﬁed for life from owning a dog or holding a

dog licence. (A6736)

QUESTIONS IN PARLIAMENT

Rabbit Traps

MR WOOD asked the Minister of Agriculture
whether he will make a further statement on the
experiments on the working of the humane rabbit
trap.

SIR T. DUGDALE: Five thousand ‘Imbra’ humane
rabbit. traps were sent to county agricultural
executive committees in March and April. The trap
shows that it will catch and kill rabbits humanely.
The manufacturers have made a further improve,
ment to the design and supplies of the modiﬁed
trap will be sent to county agricultural. executive
committees. I shall receive reports from them
when full—scale trapping is in progress following
the harvest. The Agricultural Departments have
examined a number of other rabbit traps which
are claimed to be humane. One of these, in
particular, has shown possibilities on test in
Scotland, but the tests are not yet complete.

MR WOOD: When does my right hon and
gallant Friend expect that a ﬁnal decision on this
trap and its efﬁciency will be reached?

SIR T. DUGDALE: I do not anticipate that it will
be before the beginning of next year. Owing to
technical difficulties, the traps were not available
before the spring of this year, which was the end
of the last trapping season. The new trapping.
season will not start until after the harvest, and
then I want a full report from. all over the country
as to whether the trap is effective for its purpose.
I shall expect to get it soon after Christmas.

Squirrel Destruction Pamphlet

MR R. ROBINSON asked the Minister of Agriv
culture whether his attention has been. called to a
pamphlet recently circulated by the Forestry
Commission containing. hints on the control of
grey squirrels, in which one of the recommended
methods. of disposing, of squirrels is to coax them
into a sack and then kill them by a sharp blow on
the head with a stick; and whether, in View of the
cruelty which can be involved in attempting to
aim a lethal blow at the head of a squirrel when
hidden in a sack, he will take steps to have this
pamphlet withdrawn and amended at an early
Opportunity.

SIR T. DUGDALE: The method suggested for
killing trapped squirrels is based on practical
experience, but I will certainly consider whether
these instructions should be amended.

‘Imbra’ Rabbit Trap
MR SUMMERS asked the Minister of Agriculture
how long the test of the ‘Imbra’ trap under prac—
tical conditions is to last; on what scale it is
eing tried out, and when the results will be-
nown.
SIR T. DUGDALE: The test is expected to show

how the trap stands up to every day use and
whether it will catch and kill rabbits in all types
of location. It will continue until reliable results
on these points have been obtained. About
15,000 traps will be used for this purpose by
county agricultural executive committees through
out England and Wales. I hope to have useful
results by the beginning of next year.

Oil Pollution

SIR H. ROPER asked the Minister of Transport
whether he has now received a report from the
committee appointed by him to consider what
steps can be taken to prevent pollution of the coast
by oil; and whether he will make a statement.
MR R. ROBINSON asked the Minister of
Transport when he expects to receive the report
of his committee on the prevention of pollution
of the sea by oil. I
THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE MINIS—
TRY OF TRANSPORT (MR GURNEY BRAITHWAITE):
My right hon Friend expects to receive the comv
mittee’s report by the end of this week. He is
arranging that it shall be printed and hopes that
copies will be available before the House rise-s
for the summer recess. .

CATTLE LOADERS’ RESPECT FOR
BIRD’S NEST
Senior Inspector Bielby was on duty at the rail,
way docks at Kirbymoorside when he saw that
some of the men could not get on with loading
although a certain waggon was not in use. He in—
quired and learnt from the District Commercial
Superintendent that that particular waggon was
not to be used as there was a bird’s nest in it. The
Senior Inspector went towards the waggon and
saw a spotted ﬂycatcher leave the nest in whiCh
there were three young. The District Commercial
Superintendent explained that the cattle loaders
decided themselves that the waggon should be

put out of action so that the bird and her young
should be undisturbed.

deaths: Miss Monica Bradford, former hon
secretary for Banbury Rural auxiliary; Major

THANKS IN KIND

Recently a pigeon who
had her leg brOken, appar—
ently in a road accident,
was taken to the Chelten—
ham clinic by some chil«
dren and handed to the
care of Inspector R.
Butﬁeld. The identiﬁca—
tion ring had been
smashed beyond recog-
nition. A veterinary sur—
geon set the leg in splints
made of matchsticks,
and the pigeon spent two
weeks’ ‘convalescence’
in a cage, then being
taken outside to the avi—
ary. The leg mended, and
‘Hoppy’ (as she was im—
mediately dubbed) ﬂew
off for some much-
needed exercise, always
returning at night. As if
in gratitude for the way
she had been treated, she
presented the clinic with
two eggs, which she
proceeded to hatch out.

SALES OF FOREST AND MOORLAND
PONIES

(From the Report. of the Committee of Inquiry into
the Slaughter of Horses, H.M. Stationery Ofﬁce,
price 13. 9d. net)

Certain of the animal welfare societies referred to
the sales of ponies bred in the New Forest and
on Dartmoor and Exmoor and alleged that at
sales held last year many foals had been sold, the
majority being bought by recognized horse
slaughterers. It was said that many of these foals
were unweaned and they were deprived of proper
food from the time they were separated from
their dams until they were slaughtered and that
they suffered injuries as a result of being penned
with larger ponies and from rough handling by
dealers. It was also said that many foals were
transported considerable distances to the place
of slaughter and that it was not unusual for some
of them to be taken from one sale to another.

The societies suggested that the sale of foals
under .four months should be prohibited and
that it should be made illegal to transport una
weaned foals long distances.

We discussed these allegations with repre’
sentatives of the Society responsible for organ—
izing the sales of New Forest ponies and were told
that the Society made adequate arrangements for
the prevention of cruelty; a veterinary surgeon
was present at each sale as well as ofﬁcials of the
RSPCA and the police; the Society did not accept
foals under four months at the sales; the foals
were penned separately from older ponies and
handled by local men who had lifelong experience
of unbroken ponies and sticks were not allowed.

The Society’s representatives said they thought
the complaints about last year’s sale were due to
the fact that the ﬁrst sale had had to be held in
July instead of at the beginning of August as was
usual which meant that the foals were that much
younger. The Society did not agree with the alle—
gations which had been made but nevertheless
they were anxious to avoid any future criticism
and they had introduced a new rule that in future
no foal would be accepted at the ﬁrst sale unless
it was with its dam.

The Chief Constables of the areas where sales
of wild ponies are held told us that they were
satisﬁed that all reasonable steps were taken to
prevent cruelty and to ensure proper feeding and
watering of the animals. The police assisted by
ofﬁcials of the RSPCA supervised the unloading,
handling and loading of the animals at the sales
and although isolated complaints of cruelty had
been made they had not been substantiated on
investigation.

KITTENS IN A CRATE

Mr C. R. Beaumont, Bedlington and Cambois
Auxiliary Hon Secretary (of Newcastleauponv
Tyne Branch) has a cat named Dinkie who is
fostering two kittens , from Southampton. The
kittens were found in a supposedly empty wooden
crate which was received by a Gateshead ﬁrm from
Southampton. Altogether there were four kittens
but two died. Investigations on how the kittens
got into the crate and who put them there are
still going on.
