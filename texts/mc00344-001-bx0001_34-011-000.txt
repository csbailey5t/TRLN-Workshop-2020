ANIMAL TESTING

 

A Guide to Resources

In response to many requests for information resources on
animal welfare and the use of animals in product safety testing
and research, the [ohns Hopkins Center for Alternatives to Ani-
mal Testing (CAAT) is pleased to issue this edition of its news—
letter. It is primarily the result of a meeting sponsored by CAAT
and the Animal Welfare Information Center (AWIC), part of the
USDA’s National Agricultural Library. Individuals from sev-
eral organizations involved in animal welfare and alternatives to
animal testing shared their goals and described the types of
resource information available.

At a time when public concern over animal use in testing is
increasing, there also is an expanding level of concern about the
safety of commercial products and drugs. As a result, there is a

pressing need for scientifically sound and accurate information
on in vitro techniques that must be disseminated to a diverse
audience.

What follows are brief descriptions of available publications
from the: Animal Welfare Information Center; Animal Welfare
Institute; Applied Research Ethics National Association;
Canadian Council on Animal Care; Center for Animals in Public
Policy at Tufts University; Hastings Center; Institute for Labo-
ratory Animal Resources; IT. Morgan Foundation; National
Library of Medicine; Public Responsibility in Medicine and
Research; Scientists Center for Animal Welfare; and Center for
Alternatives to Animal Testing.

Mission Statement

The mission of the Center for Alternatives to Ani-
mal Testing is to:

- Develop, to the extent consistent with the public’s
health and safety, in vitro alternatives to the use of
whole animals in evaluating commercial and thera-
peutic products. Alternatives are new tests that reﬁne
existing ones or reduce or replace whole animal tests.

- Validate alternative methods and encourage
their use.

- Disseminate scientifically correct information
about alternatives and their use.

It should be recognized that in vitro methods act in
concert with whole animal and clinical studies to:

- Advance science

° Develop new products and drugs and

- Treat, cure and prevent disease.

the Animal Welfare Act. The primary mission is to pro-
vide informational materials on alternatives to animal use
in testing, research and education, the proper care and
use of laboratory animals, training materials for labora-
tory animal personnel, new research methodologies,
animal careand use committees, legislation and regula-
tion, and bioethics.

Publications include bibliographies such as Animal
Welfare Legislation and Regulation; Welfare of Experimental
Animals; Animal Models of Disease; and Proceedings of a 1989
Conference on Animal Care and Use in Behavioral Research:
Regulations, Issues and Applications. Reference briefs are
available, such as Animal-Related Computer Simulation Pro—
grams for Use in Education and Research; Reference Materials
for Non-Affiliated Members of Animal Care and Use Commit-
tees; Animal Care and Use Committees; The LD50 (Medial
Lethal Dose) lbxicity Test; The Draize Eye—Irritancy Test, 1979-
1988, and others. There is also a videotape, Resources To-
day for the Research of "Ibmorrow (about the Animal Welfare
Information Center and its services), and AWIC expects
to publish the first edition of its quarterly newsletter this

ear.
y NAL has an informational database called AGRICOLA
and has access to more than 500 other informational data-
bases such as MEDLINE, TOXLINE, EMBASE, 310515,
and LIFE SCIENCES. AWIC staff also produce special-
ized bibliographies, reference briefs and listings on topics
which are timely and pertinent to current issues affecting
the laboratory animal research community. Simulation
software and audiovisuals also are available in the NAL.

The Animal Welfare Institute is a non-profit charitable
organization founded in 1951 to reduce the sum total of
pain and fear inﬂicted on animals by man. A specific goal
of the Institute is to see the full implementation of alter-
natives (refinement, reduction and replacement of ani-
mals) in research and testing. The Institute was
instrumental in the publishing and distribution of Russell
and Burch’s The Principles of Humane Experimental Tech-
nique, and has continued to publish and distribute infor-
mation on all three R’s. There is strong interest in
working cooperatively with the biomedical industry to
change conditions for animals being used and to explore
replacement methodologies to the use of animals. A list of
the Institute’s publications and more information about
the Institute are available.

(ARENA), is a national membership organization for re-
searchers, other professionals interested in bioethics,
administrators, and members of IRBs, IACUCs, hospital
ethics committees and patient advocacy groups.
ARENA’s function is to promote networking, to develop
educational activities and to resolve and/or ameliorate
mutual problems among its members. ARENA also pro-
vides assistance with the development of regional net-
works and prepares commentary on, and response to,
relevant federal legislation and/or administrative initia-
tives. ARENA sponsors two annual programs in conjunc-
tion with two Public Responsibility in Medicine and

Contact: Alan Goldberg, Ph.D., director

The goal of the Center for Alternatives to Animal Test-
ing (CAAT) is to develop innovative non-whole-animal
methods to fully evaluate commercial and/or therapeutic
products to ensure the health and safety of the public.
This goal is accomplished by funding research which will
lead to the refinement, replacement and reduction of
animals in toxicity testing and by disseminating scientific
information about these methods and their applications.

In vitro methods are integral to good science and it is
recognized by the Center that invitro methods act in con-
cert with whole animal and clinical studies to advance our
knowledge base, develop new products and drugs and
treat, cure and prevent disease.

CAAT publishes its newsletter three times a year and
has begun to issue Technical Reports on specific scientific
issues involved in in vitro toxicity testing.

The National Library of Medicine (NLM) has under-
taken a number of projects related to alternatives and
animal welfare. Many special bibliographies and on-line
services are available.

N LM provides the subject heading “Animal Testing Al-
ternatives” for articles from journals indexed in INDEX
MEDICUS beginning in 1985. The heading includes “pro-
cedures, such as tissue culture, mathematical models,
etc., when used or advocated for use in place of the use
of animals in research or diagnostic laboratories.” This
subject heading can also be used for on-line searching.

As a result of a collaborative effort with CAAT early in
1984, NLM developed annotated bibliographies on Ani-
mal Testing Alternatives, which were published periodi-
cally. This project evolved into a collaboration with the
National Research Council’s Institute of Laboratory Ani-
mal Resources (ILAR) to produce and publish quarterly
and annual bibliographies on Animal Alternatives.

NLM’s MEDLARS System and its bibliographic data-
bases, particularly MEDLINE and TOXLINE, provide
valuable services to those interested in the care and use
of animals in research. They provide easy access to the
current published literature. The Computer Retrieval of
Information on Scientific Projects (CRISP) subfile of TOX-
LIN E also provides descriptions of research in progress.
The Directory of Information Resources On-line (DIR-
LINE) is an on-line directory of resource centers which
provides information and other services related to health,
including animal welfare.

Contact: Joan Rachlin, executive director

Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research
(PRIM&R) was founded in 1974 by a group of clinicians
and researchers from the major teaching hospitals in
Massachusetts who were interested in the ethical, legal
and regulatory issues increasingly affecting their work.

 

At the same time, they wanted to promote greater trust in
research by changing the public perception that science
often proceeds without regard to ethics and patient/
subject needs.

Now a national non-profit organization, PRIM&R is
dedicated to providing a multidisciplinary forum for
addressing biomedical and bioethical issues. It accom-
plishes these goals through educational programs and
publications geared to the medical and legal professions,
pharmaceutical and biotechnological industry and the
public. Meetings focus on the ethical, legal and policy di-
mensions of appropriate and ethical research and clinical
practice. »

PRIM&R hosts four conferences each year. Topics ex-
plored at these meetings have included: the operation of
IRBs and IACUCs, problems surrounding AIDS care and
treatment, relationships between academia and industry,
access to (and cost of) health care, and ethical and policy
issues of new biotechnologies.

QNIMQL NELFQRE INSTITUTE MQTERIQLS STOLEN QT QMERICQN QSSDCIQTIUN
FDR LQBDRQTDRY QNIMRL SCIENCE’S QNNUQL MEETING

HQSHINGTDN, Nov. 1 /PRNewswire/ ~— Books and materials which
detailed recommendations for the humane treatment of animals in
laboratories were stolen from the ﬁnimal Welfare lnsitute’s booth
at the annual meeting of the Rmerican ﬁssociation for Laboratory
Rnimal Science (QQLQS) in Little Rock, QrH.

In their place the vandals left anti~animal rights literature.
The meeting which ends Nov. 3, is being attended by over 3,@@@
members of the biomedical industry. The Qnimal Welfare Insitute is
the only animal protection group attending the meeting.

ﬁn ﬁnimal welfare Institute staff member, William Cotreau, had
left the booth to attend a scientific session. ”When I came back,
everything was taken.“ It was a ”flagrant attempt to prevent
communication which would benefit the welfare of animals in labs,“
he said. Only authorized persons wearing QQLQS badges were
permitted to enter the display area.

QQLQS meets every year to exchange information on the use and
care of laboratory animals and to provide animal dealers,
manufacturers of cages, equipment and food with marketing
opportunities. -The Hnimal Welfare lnstut‘ute5 founded in 1951, has
distributed material to QQLQS since its inception, over 3% years
ago. RNl has worHed to improve the treatment of animals in
laboratories by distributing such books as Comfortable Quarters for
Laboratory ﬁnimals free of charge to research facilities.

Amml welfare goals, tactics

send fur flying within groups

By Larry Hackett
New York Dally News

It’s a dog-eat-dog world out there among animal
lovers.

With winter on the way, the offensive against the fur
industry is gathering unprecedented momentum “Cru-
elty-free” cosmetics and clothing are enjoying increas-
ing popularity. But despite the gains, relations are not
soft and cuddly among all the organizations dedicated to
animal protection.

More than a dozen board members and staffers at
Bide-A- Wee Home, a Manhattan animal care organiza-
tion, were axed or quit In June, over what they say was a
power play engineered by board treasurer Vivian
Blount. The departed claim Blount opposed their in-
creasing involvement against fur, laboratory testing and
other animal rights issues.

Blount won’t comment, though an attorney says the
dismissals were ordered for “economy reasons.” Ob-
servers say a similar struggle is taking place at the To-
ronto Humane Society, where animal rights supporters
took over in 1985. They have since fended off what
partisans say were two attempted coups.

“I don’t think it’s rare at all,” Merritt Clifton, an
editor with Animals’ Agenda magazine, says of the
power plays. “It’s a common and natural phenome-
non. ”

But is it more than ego-wrestling? After all, the
squabbles are pitting those who think it’s okay to kill
animals against those who don’t.

Older and more established societies like the Ania.»
mal Welfare Institute and the Humane Society of the

 

- ’ umans should protect animals
and minimize pain. But they do not oppose meat-eating
or animal testing, convinced society is unable to aban-
don animal use immediately.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Trans
Species Unlimited and the Fund for Animals, on the
other hand, uniformly are outraged by the use of ani-
mals for testing, food, clothing or anything that involves
holding animals against their will. Supporters are urged
to reprimand fur wearers in the street. A few extremists,
like the Animal Liberation Front, resort to break-ins at
labs to expose cruel conditions, a tactic that dismays
most animal welfare groups.

Moderate welfare groups are more at home talking

to lawmakers than berating people in a building lobby. -.

“Sometimes half a loaf is better than none,” says Hu-
mane Society spokeswoman Helen Mitternight. “If you
go in with an inflexible absolutist attitude, sometimes
you come away with nothing.”

Seeing this philosophical gulf, animal users — med-
ical researchers, fur manufacturers, university labora-
tories — want to exploit it in hopes of dividing their
adversaries.

An American Medical Association document spell-
ing out its offensive against animal rights listed among
its arsenal an effort to “isolate the hard-core activists
from the general public and shrink the size of sympa-
thizers. . .. This can be done by exploiting the differ-
ences that already exist over goals and tactics.” To
succeed, the AMA must portray activists as “responsible
for violent and illegal acts” and against medical
progress. .

But bad manners seem to be working for the animal
rights movement. Revlon and Avon have abandoned an-
imal testing, as have toymakers Mattel and Hasbro. The
besieged fur industry has hired Burson-Marsteller, the
world’s largest public relations firm, to battle back.

Christine Stevens, president of the Animal Welfare
Institute and one of the grand dames of the movement,
tips her hat to animal rights’ guerrilla strategy. She testi-
fied repeatedly before Congress urging an end to the
Draize Test (inserting cosmetics into cats’ eyes to test
for toxicity), but it was only after activists paraded in
front of cosmetics companies that the testing stopped.

“I’m happy to give the credit to the animal rights
groups,” Stevens says. “But without the laws we’ve got-
ten passed, the animal rights people would be at sea in
many cases.”

Leaders on both sides insist, at least publicly,
there’s plenty of room for both approaches. “We all have
the same goals, just different means,” says Mitternight..
Adds PETA’s Carol Burnett: “We don’t worry about
credit. We don’t have time to worry about that.” The
Humane Society and groups like PETA and Trans Spe-
cies Unlimited have been allies, but have never share
the same trench. Rallies and concerts are never co-
sponsored, for example, which some say squanders the
movement’s energy.

“If the animal rights and welfare communities
could get together on one issue,” says Kathy Sanbom of
the National Alliance on Animal Legislation, “we could
really make a difference.”

ANIMAL WELFARE BOYCOTT LIST

Whom should you boycott this week? Anyone with
idle time, looking for a project, can find a list of
all the current boycotts, along with the group calling
it, in a newsletter published in Seattle, Washington.
Also listed are the product or name, the address of
the ﬁrm boycotted, the "boycotter" organization and
address, and a synopsis of the cause for the boycott.

With the list in hand, you can plan which stores to
skip, products or services for which to seek
substitutes, and even countries to eliminate from your
travel plans.

Some of the boycotts listed are:

Gi 1 let te: Ronald J. Rossi, President, Gillette
Canada. Boycott called by: ARK 11, Toronto, Ontario.
Reason for Boycott: An animal caretaker, with 1 1/2
years Gillette employment in a laboratory, left her
job. She stated that the company subjected animals to
inhumane and unnecessary tests and allowed abuse and
suffering of animals. She further claimed they also
put into effect a policy of lies and deception through
the company’s public statements about its use of
animals.

Icelandic Fish Products: Embassy of Iceland.
Boycott called by: The Humane Society of the United
’- States, mm _ ' , e Sea Shepherd

ConservationJ’Societyanfot Erin'groups. Reason for
Boycott: Iceland agreed to the 1986 cessation of
"commercial whaling" imposed by the International
Whaling Commission, but the country continues to kill
whales, stating it is "research whaling." Allegedly,

the country intends to make "millions" selling the
'meat, and is, according to this source, encouraging
other whaling nations continue the whaling.

Danish Products: Prime Minister Atli P. Dam.
Boycott called by: Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.
Reason for Boycott: A campaign to end the annual
slaughter of thousands of pilot whales in the Danish
dependency of the Faroe Islands. Allegedly, the hunt
is actually performed as a sport as well as tradition.
The boycotters feel it is completely unnecessary,
extremely cruel and brutal.

R.H. Macy & Co.; Sears Roebuck & Co.;Al l ied "
Stores Corp.; Federated Department Stores;

Batus, Inc.: Boycott called by: Trans-Species
Unlimited. Reason for Boycott: To get these stores
and their subsidiaries to drop furs from their lines
because of the suffering and death of animals which
TSU feels is not justiﬁed by the call for furs.

Japanese, Norwegian and Soviet Fish Products:
Sponsored by: The Humane Society of the United
States. Reason for Boycott: Japan, Norway and the

   

 

Soviet Union continue whaling in violation of the
International Whaling Commission ban on all commer '
whaling which went into effect on January 1, 1986.

Milk-fed veal: Sponsored by: The Humane Socic
of the United States and Humane Farming Associatio,
Reason for Boycott: The practice of raising calves in
narrow wooden crates to produce "milk-fed" veal for
market is not justiﬁed and is the worst of all the
livestock confinement methods.

Rabbit products: Boycott called by: Humans
Against Rabbit Exploitation. Reason for Boycott: To
nip in the bud the potential growth of the
rabbit-raising industry. The boycotters feel rabbits
will be intensively farmed just like chickens, pigs,
and veal calves, and thus treated only as organisms to
produce meat, while suffering severe stress and
depression.

Boycott called by: Boycott for the Whales. Reason
for Boycott: A coalition of environmental and
animal-welfare organizations wanting to boycott the
airlines until the Japanese government, JAL’s major
shareholder (with close to 40% of the airline’s
shares) agrees to abide by the International Whaling
Commission ban on all commercial whaling. The
Japanese government has indicated it will not follow
this ban.

Cosmetic and toiletry ccnpanies which test

on animals: Sponsored by: People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals (PETA). Reason for Boycott:
Alleged cruel and unnecessary testing on animals.

The Coca-Cola (Inpany: Donald R. Keough,
president, Coca-Cola USA. Boycott called by:
International Society or Animal Rights, Inc. 7 Reason

of rodeos, which the sponsors allege might lead to
serious injuries, as well as often having the animds
"worked over" with kicking, electric prodding, and
physical abuse.

(Editor) On some of these I can agree on the
purpose, butam doubtful thatjhetarget is really the
. cause of fhe problem. Others lead me to to‘go out of
my way to support theiﬁrms in question. For example;
I like grapes and every time Cesar Chavez calls for a
boycott on table grapes I buy more. Perhaps some of
the damage done can be offset if enough people make
it known when they don’t agree with efforts to "blackm.‘ ‘
companies based on obscure reasoning.

The impact of activists on the general public can
be a serious problem for firms that depend on mass

 

marketing. Young people are particularly vulnerable to

; ANIMAL TES'nNG: The Cambridge, MA city council approved (5/18) the country's first ban on commercial
laboratory testing of animals. Several labs there use dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, cats, mice, monkeys and
hamsters to test cosmetics, tobacco products, chemicals, pesticides and engine exhaust. Any testing on
animals locally? Is there a similar move to ban in your area? Is the testing common knowledge? Do colleges
do these tests? What animals used? For what purposes? How often? Are there animal activists in your
community? The Animal Welfare Institute (202/337-2332), Beauty Without CrUelty (212/989-8073) and the
Humane Society of the US (202/452-1100) can add information."

We hava been absolutely swamped with orders, and
one little-boy wrota and said, “A frienﬂ of mine has

from a mongoose and a bald eagle"!

Perhaps we shouad think of offering information on
other subjects. too.

“Direct mail and donations
from individuals.”

That’s the answer you’re likely to get
when you ask an animal organization
about fund raising. And with only a few
exceptions, they’ll tell you that mem-
berships and donations are on the
upswing.

The Washington (D.C.) Humane
Society has seen its membership more
than double in the past five years.
“We’ve grown in spite of the economy,”
says President Jean Goldenberg.
“We’ve embarked on a campaign to
educate the community about what we
do. Prior to that we always went about
our business quietly.”

Goldenberg says the Society has
used a combination of direct mail and
public service announcements to edu-
cate the public. They’ve built a reputa-_
tion for their programs, which include
anticruelty investigation, animal control,
rescue, adoption, education, training
and spay/neuter services. “We do a lot
of direct mail, and we’re aggressively
fund raising. But we back that up with
excellent programs,” Goldenberg says.

In the Washington metropolitan
area, there may be as many as 30 ani-
mal groups—all competing for a part of
the localdonors’ dollar. Goldenberg
says humane groups avoid fighting
among themselves for dollars by provid-
ing different services.

“That way we can all work in this
field and take care of business, without
stepping on each other’s toes,”
she says.

The Washington Animal Rescue
League is an example of a local animal
group with a well-defined niche. The
League specializes in animal adoption
and uses PSAs and print ads to publi-

 

cize its services. President Elizabeth
Kiernan reports that print ads are ef-
fective. “We get phone calls immediate-
ly. We get a rise in mail immediately,”
she says.

Anticruelty is a niche that Cleveland
Amory’s Fund for Animals fills. Glenn
Chase of their Washington office says:
“It’s visibility in the news media that’s
gotten us all the new members.”
Amory’s group is well known for rescuing
the goats on San Clemente Island, the
burros in the Grand Canyon and harp
seals in Newfoundland. Chase says
the Fund doesn’t use direct mail solicita-
tions regularly. Instead, they rely on
memberships and donations to support
their work.

The Animal Welfare Institute also
relies on memberships and individual
contributions. They also do some mer-
chandizing (Save the Whales T shirts,
etc.). John Gleiber, staff assistant, ,
says the Institute was established be-
cause there was no middle ground.
None of the animal groups took the posi-
tion that it is necessary to use animals
in scientific research, but they must be
treated humanely. “We’re not antivivi-
sectionists,” Gleiber says.

The Institute has used celebrity
PSAs to publicize its educational mes-
sages. Gleiber says spots with Greg-
ory Peck, Jack Lord, Jason Robards and
Katherine Hepburn were arranged
through personal contacts. (Institute
President Christine Stevens’ husband
Roger is head of the Kennedy Center in
Washington.)

People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals (PETA) has found yet another

 

Bﬂs

niche to fill—animal rights. ”There are

 

 

 

two distinctly different animal move-
ments—animal welfare and animal
rights,” says PETA cofounder Ingrid
Newkirk. “Animal welfare groups say if
you use animals you must treat them
kindly. Animal rights groups say we
have no right to use these animals at all,”
Newkirk explains. “Some people
won’t work with us because we’re too
radical. Others will only support
groups like ours.”

PETA has tried direct mail and has
hired a consultant to handle fund-raising

efforts. But its current strategy, publi-
cizing its efforts through the news media,
and distributing a pair of award-win-
ning public service announcements, has
been effective.

“If I can talk to one person on the
street, that’s fine,” Newkirk says. “If I can
talk ata gathering of 200, that’s good.
But if I can get into the Washington Post,
that’s a lot better.

“When we do our fund raising, we
mention the story. The fact that it’s been
in the news provided more recognition
to the issue,” Newkirk says. “People
say, ‘Oh, yes, I remember that. l sup-
port that. lt’s worthwhile.’ But if they’ve
never heard of us before, it’s harder.”

PETA’s public service announce-
ments are another success story. The
two spots, “Hot Dog” and “Chilly Dog”
won the bronze medal at the 26th Annual
International Film and Television Fes-
tival in New York. Judged third best PSA
in the world, behind the first place
“Mormon Church” and second place
“United Way,” the two spots cost
PETA less than $2,000 to produce and
distribute. (PETA donated the spots to
local humane societies and to the Ameri-
can Humane Association. The spots
were distributed via satellite from Wash-
ington to local stations in January
1984)

The key to PETA’s PSA success is
Mike Handley, a local broadcast narrator
who donated his time, enthusiasm and
talent. Handley came up with the idea for
the two spots which point out the dan-
gers of leaving a dog in a car during hot
weather and leaving a dog outside in
the winter. PETA held some fund rais-

 

 

 

   

 

 

ers, ralsmg about $1 ,200. Handley got
several Washington broadcasters to
donate their time and equipment.

On the wildlife side, Greenpeace,
the international environmental organi-
zation, employs a strategy similar to
PETA’s. They have professional broad-
casters volunteer to produce their
PSAs. They work at keeping a high pro-
file in the news media. And they use
direct mail.

Greenpeace National Media Coor-
dinator Peter Dykstra says James Watt
and Ann Gorsuch-Burford motivated

people to respond to direct mail solicita-
tions. “Watt was recognized as the
second most prolific fund raiser for the
Republican party, behind the presi-
dent himself,” Dykstra says. “At the
same time he’s been recognized as

the polarizing factor that motivated a lot
of people to become supportive of the
environmental movement.”

With Watt and Gorsuch-Burford
gone, wildlife and environmental organi-
zations, who get donations largely
through direct mail, are working new
strategies.

It’s ironic that environmental groups
use direct mail, which consumes a lot of
trees. Dykstra admits it can be waste-
ful and inefficient because a “good” re-
sponse is only about three to five per-
cent. But he says, “In a sense it’s ex-
tremely efficient because it frees our
staff to work on issues.”

The World Wildlife Fund—U.S. gets
most of its funds from direct mail. Press
Officer Neill Heath asks, “What’s the
alternative to direct mail? It’s justified
because we’re mainly concerned
about tropical forests, and we don’t use
tropical forests trees to make paper.”

Heath says the Fund has additional
income from a commercial license on
their panda logo, as well as some
foundation and corporate support. But
most of their funding comes from di-
rect mail, with appeals to the upscale
small donor genuinely interested in in-
ternational conservation.

Just up the street from the World
Wildlife Fund, another animal group,
Friends of the National Zoo (FONZ)
supports international conservation re-

 

   

 

 

_ The Washington
‘Animal Rescue
League

search and education carried out by
200 scientists. FONZ President Sabin
Robbins says profile studies show

their members above average in educa-
tion and income and belonging to oth-
er wildlife organizations. They support
FONZ because they believe the zoo is
playing a significant role in wildlife
conservation.

FONZ has produced radio, televi-
sion and print PSAs, with disappointing
results. Robbins says: "You can’t cal-
culate the overall image-making we’ve
created. We may be softening them up

 

 

 

4o

 

 




 

 

 

 

so that when they get a direct response
vehicle, like direct mail, they’re more
likely to respond favorably.”

Robbins reports that FONZ gets the
bulk of its new members through direct
mail. He’s tried all sorts of pitches,
even a sweepstakes. In the beginning he
got a three or four percent return. Now,
he says, it’s running from one to one and
a half percent. “We’re having a harder
and harder time getting good lists,” Rob-
bins explains.

Defenders of Wildlife, an national
animal group based in Washington, also
gets most of its revenue from direct
mail. But that may change this year. Ac-
cording to Public Relations Director
Dan Smith, “We’re going out actively this
year to get foundation funding.” De-
fenders focuses its efforts on endan-
gered species, the National Wildlife
Refuges and wildlife management on
public lands. Smith says they had
some small success with foundations
last year. But he says, “Ours isn’t any-
thing like the Wilderness Society’s suc-
cess of some $750,000 from the Mel-
lon Foundation for their economics
program.”

There are hundreds of nonprofit
groups working to better the world for
animals, domestic and wild, all fishing
for donations from essentially the same
pool. Who are the fish? Each group
has a theory about why people donate to
animal causes:

“A lot of people concur with the AI-
bert Schweitzer theory that a society will
be judged on how well it treats ani-
mals. The abuse of any helpless crea-
ture is intolerable, whether it be old

 

 

 

 

 

  

people or children or animals,” says
Jean Goldenberg.

“People who really care about ani-
mals have the humanitarian spirit.
They’re the ones who care about peo-
ple and do things for people. They’re not
blind to suffering wherever they see
it,” says Elizabeth Kiernan.

John Gleiber believes, “They’re the
ones with a tremendous awareness of
the importance of the world around us,
not just the animals, but the total
environment.”

According to Ingrid Newkirk: “Any-

 

 

 

body and everybody.”

“People who care about internation-
al conservation. People who believe that
what goes on outside our borders is
very important,” says Neill Heath.

“People who want the environment
and all its components, including wild-
life, to be preserved so they can enjoy
it,” says Dan Smith.

“There’s a growing and ovenNhelm-
ing conscience about the humane treat-
ment of animals, that they’re not here
simply to be exploited,” says Peter
Dykstra.

The successful fund raisers seem to
have three things in common: They rec-
ognize the importance of media strate-
gy and planning and keep a high media
profile through public service spots
and effective news publiCity. They pick
their issues, taking a lead with some,
and stepping back in others. And they
look to their membership for volunteer
assistance.

Service to America (VISTA), the New

B D York Landmarks Preservation Com-
mission and countless musical groups.

Perhaps the most celebrated public
service project he has conceived is the “I
V New York” campaign. Sighted as
far afield as the Great Wall of China, the
ubiquitous logo has spawned clones
the world over. Glaser also executes
most of the posters in the campaign,
highlighting a different regional New
York festival every season. Celebrat-
ing events like spring wildflowers and fall
foliage, the posters are quickly be-
coming collectors’ items. According to
Bern Rotman, director of communica-
tions for the New York State Department
of Commerce, sponsor of the project:

“Long after the festivals are over, they
A P R OF I LE OF survive as art.” But for Glaser, the acid

MIL TON G LA SE R test is not attracting imitators or becom-

Dear Ms. Eisnitz:

This is to acknowledge that we have reviewed your proposed article and the
background materials pertaining to the abduction, sale, and subsequent usage
of family pets as experimental subjects for scientific research.

This issue is of concern to us at GAP although it does not fall within our
traditional purview. I personally commend you for the excellent research
you have submitted to us. We feel thatit;is a high quality effort and was
pursued in a professional manner.

I suggest that you not submit the proposed article to any publication for the
next two weeks. Unless you object, it seems to me that "60 Minutes" should
have a chance to review the material. Obviously, I have no control whatsoever
over.that program, but nevertheless, its producers are continually on the
look-out for the type of research material that you have pulled together.

Please do not get your hopes up, but when I see the work and concern that
obviously went into your article, I would like to do what I can to see that
the material gets some attention.

Yours truly,

“There is no conflict between science
and humanity to animals. Humane sci-
ence is the best science. Humane science
is the best science as science.” So say
Russell and Burch in The Principles of
Humane Experimental Technique, first
published in 1959 under auspices of the
Universities Federation for Animal
Welfare, a British humane organiza-
tion. Throughout the book the zoolo-
gist authors present evidence to support
their claim that the longstanding, often
bitter controversy over the role of ani-
mals and of humane treatment of ani-
mals in biological research rests on mis-
understanding. They point out, for
example, that distress creates a dis-
torted situation and therefore distorted
data, and that ignoring the particular
needs of the animal model leads to

, badly interpreted results. They recom-
mend study of the psychosomatics of
laboratory animals and propose crea-
tion of an integrative specialty devoted
to study of research design and humane
experimental technique.

The authors categorize their princi-
ples as replacement, reduction and re-
finement, the “3 Rs” of humane ex-
perimental technique. Replacement
means the substitution of non-animal
techniques for live animals. Reduction
uses fewer animals. Refinement, in
those situations where live animals are
still needed, ‘means finding and using
elegant, humane methods.

Some examples of replacement are
the use of tissue culture in virology and
toxicology, and the use of microorga-
nism assays in nutritional research. Key
concepts in replacement are “discrimi-
nation” and “fidelity.” Discrimination
refers to the key properties in which the
researcher is interested, whereas fidelity
refers to overall inter-species similarity.
The “high fidelity fallacy” leads people
to prefer mammals as experimental

looksHEtr

models because they share more fea-
tures with the human, but these fea-
tures may not include the best discrim-
inating and correlating ones. The
authOrs admit that if we know practi-
cally nothing of the sub-system we are
studying (say, the effects of a com-
pletely new substance) it seems to make
sense to test the substance on an orga-
nism close to the human. But they ob-
ject that “completely new” is likely to
be an exaggeration and that we may
overestimate the fidelity of mammals as
models for humans. In vitro human tis-
sue culture may after all, for some pur-
poses, be a model of higher fidelity to
the whole human organism than an in-

, tact nonhuman mammal. The authors

suggest development of a general theory
of replacement, analogous to equiva-
lence in machines.

(An illustration of discrimination in
this section serves as a beautiful ex-
ample of the authors’ unifying think-
ing: The herring gull chick, presented
with a thin rod banded in a highly dis-
criminating fashion — as determined in
other experiments —— reacts more to the
rod than it does to a model of a parent
gull’s head or even to the actual head
of a real parent gull.)

How will reduction be accomplished?
—- By improving research strategies and
reducing variance. Inbreeding will re-
duce variance. So will the study of lab-
oratory animal behavior, since it will
help determine sources of variance.

In illustrating refinement, the authors
attack what looks like the most difficult
problem: how to study pain and fear
under controlled conditions without
creating pain and fear in the animal.
They suggest a number of ways —- for
example, training rats to lift their tails
away from a painful stimulus; studying
variations in the flight component of
courtship in the stickleback. Their
methods, where painful at all, are in-
comparably less so than many current
methods and are, besides, more inter—
esting.

The book concludes with a discussion
of the factors affecting progress toward
humane techniques. Delay in commu-
nication of information is seen as of
prime importance. Specialist isolation,
an important factor in such delay, can
be helped by methodologic study and
by broad education for researchers -—
for instance, comparative physiology
for pharmacologists. The impact of

' regulatory agencies is very significant;

 

the authors recommend that agency rul-
ings be reviewed frequently to foster
rational testing; the high-fidelity fal-
lacy, they feel, may be more prevalent
at the legislative than at the laboratory
level.

The 3 Rs categories have been widely
accepted and are part of everyday use
wherever these issues are discussed, and
networks of information have been cre-
ated. However, psychosomatics of lab-
oratory animals have been studied only
to a very limited degree so far, with lit-
tle application to' reduction or refine-
ment. Scientific specialization in devel-
opment of humane techniques has

. hardly begun. This‘book remains ahead

of its time as the most lucid, unified,
and comprehensive approach yet of-
fered to the theory and practice of hu-
mane experimental technique.

The Use of Alternatives in Drug Re—
search, edited by Rowan and Strat-
mann, is a quite different kind of book.
It is a collection of talks by scientists
from different disciplines at a historic
first conference about alternatives in
1980. Dr. Rowan, the senior editor and
an Oxford-trained biochemist, was for-
merly scientific director of the Fund for
the Replacement of Animals in Medical
Experiments, the sponsoring organiza-
tion.

Several articles introduce the uses
and problems of tissue culture: Two,
for example focus on ‘in vitro cell
models for studying mechanisms of
toxicity and resistance, and a third
summarizes the rapidly developing use
of short-term microbial assays for as-
sessing carcinogenic risk. A‘timely
“Alternative to the Draize Test” paper
presents the preliminary —- but favor-
able — results of. shampoo testing using
an established line of mouse embryo
cells, and another paper presents an in
vitro battery for teratogen assay. A
study of the use of structure-activity
relationships in drug design is pre-
sented.

Though the discussions are of neces-
sity mostly preliminary, the volume is

_ an interesting introduction to the cur-

rent state of alternatives research. One
of the participants, Professor Nardone,
expresses particularly well what was the
primary affirmation of the conference:
“This is a unique moment in history
from the point of view of our oppor-
tunity to exploit in vitro systems. This
stems from a convergence of important
opportunities, some of which are re-
lated to basic cell biology research,
some to startling advances in tissue cul-
ture technology, and others to environ-
mental concerns.”

The effectiveness of the conference
report would have been enhanced by a
transcription of the discussion among
the participants; it is hoped that this
will be done in future volumes. The re-
striction to in vitro alternatives in drug
research disappoints by omitting refine—
ment possibilities such as the humane
psychiatric drug assays proposed by
Russell and Burch. Some of the presen—
tations are marred by excessive at-
tempts to predict what is and is not
possible with in Vitro methods: These
presenters might have noted that, as
Rowan said in his introduction, “In

View of the success of the carcinogen
screens it is interesting to note that as
recently as 1969 it was stated that ‘the
investigation of possible carcinogenic

. effect . . . can only be studied in
animals.’ ”

Both of these books will be of inter-
est to any student of biology: ”Both pro-
vide much information, a sense of in-
tellectual adventure, and stimulating
exercises in methodology. The reader
who wants a general grasp of the field
of alternatives would do well to read
both volumes as well as such an inter-
mediate as Alternatives to Animal Ex-

broth, Academic Press, NY, 1979, 435
pages, $52.50.

 

Research using laboratory animals
has been performed in this country
since the mid-18005. In contrast, re—
search on the laboratory animals them-
selVes is of relatively recent origin.
None of the current journals concerned
primarily with the use of laboratory
animals as research substrates were in
print 30 years ago.

Recognizing the need for a com-
pilation of the voluminous literature
on the biology and diseases of labora-
tory animal species, the American Col-
lege of Laboratory Animal Medicine
(ACLAM) has sponsored a series of
texts to address this need. The Labora-
tory Rat, Volume 1, is the fourth in
the series. It has achieved the goal set
by the editors of being an authoritative
reference work. Each of the 15 chap-
ters in this volume attests to the au-
thors’ mastery of the subject matter.
The chapters are well referenced and
sufficiently illustrated. (Due to the
large amount of material to be in-
cluded, the Laboratory Rat was di-
vided into two volumes: Volume 1 de-
tails biology and diseases and Volume
2 will be devoted to research appli—
cations.)

Prior reference works sponsored by
ACLAM include The Biology of the
Laboratory Rabbit (1974); The Biology
of the Guinea Pig (1976) and Spon-
taneous Animal Models of Human
Disease, in two volumes (1979).
preparation is The Laboratory Mouse,
most voluminous of the series thus far.

I highly recommend this text as a
necessary reference book for students,
investigators, commercial producers
and libraries within the biomedical re-

requested are on the way. -

Actually, as you'll note, we offer just one free book
to members in a single year. However, rather than wttting
' you back to inquire which one, we thought you woulﬂ prefer to

Re: Animal Welfare Institute

 

Dear Mr. Kudysh:

In the early summer of 1983, Christine Stevens,
President of the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI), in the
course of a meeting with Nat Barnes of Print Litho, Inc.,
suggested that it would be a good idea to produce a
rabies poster for distribution in the D.C. schools.
Barnes responded that Print Litho, Inc. would be willing
to print such a poster for no charge, as a contribution
to the cause, and to arrange for distribution to the
schools. Barnes indicated that the paper for the posters
'would be donated by a third party. Stevens and Barnes
then called the President of the Washington Humane Society
(WHS) to discuss the project further. The poster was
Adesigned through the joint efforts of AWI, WHS and Print
Litho, Inc. After the poster was printed, a number of
copies were given to WHS, and Barnes indicated he would
have other copies delivered to the D.C. schools.

In September, AWI received a bill from Print Litho,
Inc. for the poster in the amount of $1,900. Stevens
called Barnes to express surprise at receiving the bill.
Barnes indicated that the matter could be disposed of if
AWI would pay Print Litho, Inc. $700. He indicated that
he would pay Print Litho, Inc. another $700, and that he
could then obtain a letter from PLI stating that the matter
was taken care of.

Dear Sir/Madam:

Family Circle readers love getting free things in the mail. The success

‘of our "free things for kids to send for" features are proof ~— on average,
25,000 to 40,000 of our readers sent for the booklets, coloring books, iron-
ons and products highlighted in our past articles. Once again, Family Circle
is planning to run a "Free Stocking Stuffers to Send For" article in our
October 25, 1983 issue. It goes on sale October 4th. We're looking for any
freebies (a snall postage and handling fee is allowed) that would be appro-
priate for filling children's stockings on Christmas morning.

I am very interested in seeing any free booklets , pictures , posters , decals ,
ironwons , plant seeds or any other products you may want to make available
to the public for this exciting "'stocking stuffers" feature. The require—
ments are as follows:

1. All offers. must be free. We do allow you to requrest a small fee (25¢
to $1.00, tops) for postage and handling, as long as the item is worth
more than the fee and can be considered a bargain for our readers .

g 2. The participating company or organization must be in a posit ion to han-
dle the mailing and keep a record of how many Family Circle responses are
received.

3. Since the average response can reach 25, 000, the company must confirm
in writing that it can handle a minimum of 25,000 requests. We will, of
course, note that the offer is limited to six months from date of publica-
tion.

4. I must see the offer and its packaging before using it in this feature.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me direct at 212—593-
7790, Thank you for your cooperation and interest . I would appreéiate
hearing from you as soon as possible since I must begin selecting products
and writing the article.

IF NONE OF THE CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT OF THE
United States is keeping you up at night with visions of American renewal,
there is a good reason why. The interminable, exorbitant, and media-saturated
presidential selection process reduces the ﬁeld of contenders to a tiny group of
mushy, manipulable, pop-heroes before serious political debate even gets a
chance. " '

When it comes to presidential races, as the 1980 joke had it, everyone is
Gerald Ford.

The American political system jettisons courageous candidates for cautious
ones, visionary activists for toothy technocrats, and thoughtful statesmen for
sloganeering actors. Time and again we elevate style oversubstance and daSh
for pink-lemonade politicos. .

Here we are in 1983 and already the serious candidates for president next
year could fit—physically and ideologically—into one king-sized bed. Perhaps
the most intriguing prospect, Arkansas Senator Dale Bumpers, dropped out of

the race before he even got in. Bumpers lacked the organization, money, and
visibility to go the distance. The best of the pack now, California Senator Alan
Cranston, confronts the vexing problem of looking like ET. on TV in DC.
The 1984 lineup could very well feature Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp
against John Glenn and Bill Bradley: an ex-actor and an ex-football player
against an ex-astronaut and an ex-basketball player. This face-off would speak
well fOr the rise of popular culture, but wouldynot say much for the seriousness
of American politics. _

To splash some cold water in the face of the sleepy American voter, we
would like to present the names of ten Americans who ought to be president
but do not ﬁt the prevailing bill of shiny teeth and room-temperature IQ.
These ten individuals, drawn from all walks of life, were chosen for their
political vision, their imagination, their courage, and their commitment to
making a just and productive society. They were also chosen here because they
will not likely be chosen out there; these horses are very dark indeed. 7 >

IN THE SPRING OF 1981, ALEX PACHECO,
an undergraduate at George Washington Universi-
ty, went looking for a summer job. Pacheco was not
trying to pick up some spending money, help pay
for his education or even add work experience to his
resume. He was out to help animals.

Pacheco, who the summer before had founded the
organization, People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals (PETA), was undaunted when told there
were no paying jobs available at the Silver Spring
laboratory of Dr. Edward Taub, especially when he
learned the scientist used the same kind of monkey
in his research that Pacheco had once had as a pet.
Pacheco offered to volunteer and Taub accepted, a
decision which he—and possibly the whole animal-

using scientific community— will “regret forever,”
faccolrding to Ingrid Newkirk, another PETA of-
1c1a .

The Silver Spring monkey trial—the outcome of
Pacheco’s four-month stint at Taub’s lab—burst
upon the local media in the fall of 1981. The news
photographs of miserable-looking monkeys with
chewed-off ﬁngers, the c0urtroom accusations of in-
adequate veterinary care and the eventual convic-
tion of Taub on a charge of animal cruelty—the first
such conviction, in anyone’s memory, of a scientist
—drew widespread attention to the use and possible
misuse of animals in the laboratory. (Taub, who
denies maltreating the monkeys, is in the midst of
his second appeal. He has accused PETA of wrong-
doing in gathering its evidence.) 12>

I ODAY, the trial remains the most-
celebrated event in the drive for
animal rights.

The tens of millions of mice, rats, cats, dogs,
monkeys and other animals used in American
laboratories each year-oﬁen painfully and, ac-
cording to the rights advocates, largely un-
necessarily—are one of the two main targets of
the animal rights movement. The other is

animal agriculture: 'the billions of chickens,
pigs, cattle and other animals raised each year
for food on modern “factory farms. ” The new
animal activists care about wildlife and pets,
too, and work on their behalf. But these areas
are already covered by older, richer organiza-
tions, and, say the rights activists, no matter
how widespread and terrible the problem of
unwanted dogs and cats or how serious the
threat to endangered species, the plight of
both pale in comparison to the amount of suf-

fering endured by a much larger number of x

animals on the farms and in the labs.

Like other rights movements, animal rights
was preceded and spurred by an important
book, Animal Liberation: A New Ethics For
Our Treatment of Animals, written by Peter
Singer and published in 1975. Singer uses
precise utilitarian logic to argue that the. in-
terests of animals deserve equal consideration
with those of man, and to deny this considera-
tion is “speciesism,” no more defensible than
racism or sexism. Animal Liberation makes a
convincing case to doubters that animals can
suffer, and describes in detail some of the suf-
fering caused by animal experimentation and
intensive farming. Pacheco says he “read one
chapter (and) was off ﬁghting.” Singer’s book
is the movement’s Bible.

The movement now includes dozens of
groups, from those concerned primarily with
lab animals (PETA and others) to farm animal
rights advocates (the Farm Animal Reform
Movement) to the Animal Liberation Front,
which breaks into labs and steals animals, and
to the Student Action Corps for Animals,
which is trying to stop the dissection of frogs
in high school biology classes. What all these
organizations have in common are strong new
opinions on what therelationship of man with
the other creatures of the earth ought to be.

What’s different about these animal rights
activists? “They put philosophy In a more im-
portant sphere than we do,” answers Christine

"Stevens, president of the Animal Welfare In-
stitute (AWI), one of the leading humane ‘

groups. .“We’ve never deﬁned that goal in the
distance,” she says, because there is so much
to do for animals right now.

The animal rights movement does indeed
have a vision, a clearly-defined notion of what
would be best and right. “Animals were not
put here to be hamburgers or handbags,”
asserts Ingrid Newkirk. “They have their own

’ lives to lead, things to do. They feel the same

breeze we feel.” '
Humane groups want to improve the condi-
tion of animals within the existing framework

‘of human domination. Animal rights groups

want to dismantle that framework; they want

to change not only the lives of animals, but
human lives as well. ’

The AWI, for instance, is studying alterna-'
tives to modern animal agriculture that would,
according to Stevens, “still make money for
the producers,” but reduce the stress and suf-
fering of the animals. The leaders of the ani-
mal rights movement do not believe man has
the. right to use animals for food. Just about
all, if not all of the movement’s leaders are ve-
getarians, they would prefer it if everyone else
were, too.

Brenda Kelley, treasurer of the Washington
chapter of Attorneys for Animal Rights, con-
cedes that, “carried to its logical extreme,
what we say is very disturbing to people.” The
president of the chapter, Roger Galvin, says
what is required to achieve his goal of a
“world where no animal is exploite ”is noth-
ing less than a complete change in the “whole
rapacious Western attitude that everything is a
resource (to be used).”

Several members of the new movement trace
its origins to the peace, civil rights, women’s
rights, and environmental movements of the

‘ ’60s and ’70s. Newkirk wrote an essay for the
movement, entitled “Animal Rights and the
Feminist Connection,” (in which she charged
that opponents of male supremacy “uphold
the same supremacist ideas about anima .”
(Unlike the predominantly female animal hu-
mane groups, the new animal rights move-
ment suffers no gender gap, according to activ-
ists. They explain the movement’s all-white
membership by the observation that . minori-
ties still have their own rights to worry abOut.)

Not surprisingly, conflicts have emerged be-
tween the old animal humane groups and the '
new activists. Alex Hershaﬁ, president of the
Farm Animal Reform Movement (FARM),
says some humane leaders have been “very un-_
supportive.” From the other side, Stevens
warns that “a very aggressive approach can be
counterproductive.” Pacheco says humane or-
ganizations are “used to just going after’ the
crumbs; (we’re) fed up with it.” Stevens
counters: “We work for moderate improve-
ment because that’s what we think we can
get.”

Last year, United Action for Animals
(UAA), an irascible loner which considers
itself neither a traditional nor animal rights
group, accused the humane movement of col-
lusibn with the research community in the
Congressional defeat of a UAA-drafted bill
that would have ensured a massive federal 111-.
vestment in the search for methods of research
that do not involve animals. ‘

Still, ofﬁcials on both sides say the differ-
ences are fading. Galvin, like other activists, .
thinks the humane organizations are “hustling

-c to catch up” on the new rights issue, .nowthat _
they see grbwing public interest in it. ,He also
cites Mobilization for Animals, a coalition of
several hundred animal welfare groups from
“all along the spectrum” that held demonstra-
tions in several cities last April, as a “relatively
miraculous” show of unity for any movement.

The animal rights organizations—and, in-
creasingly, the humane organizations—are so "
upset that most people are unaware of the
problems they are combatting. If the general
populace were informed, most activists be-
lieve, change would come much more quickly.

Asfor lab animals, advocates would first like
the public to knew that not all animals used in
research and testing are an integral part of the
war on cancer. Many are used for much less
serious purposes like Draize test, which in-
volves the testing of suspected irritants, such
as cosmetics and shampoo, by applying rela-
tively large quantities to rabbits’ eyes. Rabbits
are used because they cannot produce enough
tears to wash the chemicals away. (The protest
against this test led the cosmetics industry to
establish a center to find alternatives ,to
Draize. Meanwhile, the test, which the gov-
ernment endorses but does not require for the .
testing of cosmetics, is still being conducted.)

Those interested in lab animal welfare will
also point to archaic and inexact procedures
carried along, they say, by the forces of tradi-
tion and the salesmanship of animal breeders.
The LDSO test, for instance, determines how
' much of a substance is required to kill half the
animals in a testing group. Although the appli-
cability of LDSO to human health is now-open-
ly questioned by the research and testing com-'
munities, there is still no law against feeding
60 dogs a daily dese of some new substance to
see how much it takes to kill 30.’

Draize and LDSO are both testing proce-
dures. Research methods, especially psycholo-
gical research methods, can be more harmful,
#activists say. Singer describes in Animal
Liberation examples of thirsty rats being elec- .
trically shocked when they tried to drink, dogs "
being forced to jump onto electriﬁed grids,
and baby monkeys being pushed into deep
depression by being taken from their mothers
and isolated In stainless steel containers.

These experiments point up two other eb-
jections voiced by opponents of animal experi-
mentation: one, much of what 13 observed and
“discovered” at the cost of millions of animal
lives and immeasurable animal suffering is,
they say, either commonsense knowledge or
unrelated to any possible improvement in
human health; and two, identical or nearly

 

 




the necessary experience if one is an educator,
scientist, or writer. The main thing is that one
has to deal with disagreement without losing.
your temper or sense of direction and without

-- condemning those you disagree with. Some
businessmen might qualify but they may be
too used to orderingpeople around.” '

Mansﬁeld emphasizes tolerance and courage
as the most crucial personality traits. “As
president, you have to make your way by
handling people with positions equal, or near-
ly equal, to yours, people who passionately
disagree with you. It’s tough,” Mansﬁeld said,
“Also, one should not despise courage either.
John Glenn’s experience in space is helpful
and not to be despised. Conversely, pure
academic intelligence should not be overrated.
Ronald Reagan would not make a very good
student, but he has a very effective in-
telligence.”

Mansﬁeld’s choices for president combine
modesty born of tolerance with energy born of
courage. His ﬁve with the right stuff are: Ohio
Senator John Glenn, Governor James Hunt of
North Carolina, Governor Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts, Governor James Thompson of
Illinois—and President Ronald Reagan.

Mansﬁeld’s views contrast strikingly with
those of Professor Henry Steele Commager of
Amherst. Commager, a highly regarded
American historian who is known to be buddy-
buddy with potentially-perennial candidate
John Anderson, thinks we ought to look in ‘

 

 

other directions to choose our presidents.
“On the whole, the professional political
field is not very impressive,” Commager

. remarked, “Madison and Jefferson could not

be elected today...I am afraid to say we'must

turn to other spheres for real leadership. I >
have most conﬁdence in educators and scien- ‘

tists on the whole. The people who worked on
the Manhattan Project strike me as the right
type to make good presidents.”

Dramatizing his faith in academics, Com-
mager’s ﬁve personal choices for president
have a little ivy peeking out behind the ears. “I
would favor President Derek Bok of Harvard,
President Frank Rhodes at Cornell, Carl
Sagan at Cornell, Dr. Linus Pauling, although
he’s 75 or 80, and J. Robert Oppenheimer,
although he is dead, of course.”

Unlike both Mansﬁeld and Commager, who
stress either political experience or ex-
trapolitical experience, Austin Ranney, Direc-
tor of the American Enterprise Institute,
thinks that shrewd manipulation of images
and symbols is the chief ingredient of a suc-
cessful presidency. He thinks public relations
is the key.

“There are a number of things which count,” .

r Ranney said, “and the ﬁrst and foremost is.

what I call Ranney’s Law. No one is going to
be president who does not look and ' sound
good on television. You have to appear well on
television.”

“Secondly, to be an effective president you

have to have the knowledge and- ability to
work with the many different parts of our
fragmented government: a fractious Congress,
a bureaucracy which is extraordinarily resis-
tant to change, a Supreme Court which has no
clear set of ﬁxed principles, and increasingly
intransigent interest groups, such as blacks,
women, gays, and business. You have to
cooperate and deal with them.”

“Finally,” Ranney said, “as president, you
have to be- good at dealing with the media all
the time.‘ The media sees itself in an adver-
sarial position, and there’s no use inveighing
against it or complaining about it. You have to
deal with the media without damaging
yourself. After all, the only way to deal with
the people is through the media.”

Ranney says he is unimpressed with the
declared contenders for the 1984 title. “I’m
not wildly enthusiastic about any of them, to
tell you the truth. I just don’t think they’re
distinguishing themselves.”

His own choices, then? “I have one Can-
didate for president who I am constantly
pushing. His name is Tom Foley, the majority
whip of the House (a Democrat from
Washington), although he has no presidential
ambition and no active support from anyone
except me. So, at least for now, it’s kind of a
joke between the two of us.’

Like Ranney, presidential experts, political
kibbitzers, and ordinary citizens all tend to
harbor one or two favorite presidential can-

'Schlafﬂy, and Barney Frank.

 

didates in- the back 'of their minds. Other
names which were mentioned one or more
times during the writing of this article were:
Father Robert Drinan, Eleanor Smeal, Ed
Asner, Susan Sontag, Mario Cuomo, Phyliss

Another public citizen whose name kept
popping up was Ralph Nader, who particular-
ly compels the imagination as a candidate for
president and who has Often been in a very
good position to actually run. “We need a
president who will spend time ﬁnding ways to
empower people and their communities t9 m
their own government,” Nader told us. But

 

we also need Ralph Nader, the hardest work-
ing man in public life today, to make sure the
introduction of citizen participation into all
aspects of our society actually happens. So,
tempting as it was, Nader did not make our
list; we need him too much on the outside.
In the ﬁnal analysis, then, one can only hope
that the tremendous (but quiet) longing for
presidential alternatives will fOrce a reex-
amination of the ritualistic, mind-boggling
way we elect our presidents. America needs
new leaders bold enough to confront injustice
at home, corrupt governments which im-
plicate us in repression and cruelty abroad,
and the threat of nuclear annihilation
everywhere. Or, as President Lyndon Baines
Johnson once put it, “We know the difference
between chicken shit and chicken salad.”

identical experiments are conducted over and
over, year after year, with no scientist appar-
ently aware of his predecessor’s work or re-
sults. ‘ ’

What about farm animals? Probably the big-
gest change in animal agriculture brought
about by the growth of the factory and corpo-
rate farm is conﬁnement. Millions and

millions cf animals used in agriculture today ‘

never see the light of day. Nearly all chickens
nowadays are raised in long, windowless
sheds, some living on the ground, most in
cages. Either way, their standing space stead-
ily shrinks as they grow. Four or five laying
hens are usually stuffed into a cage with slight-
ly more ﬂoor space than a single page of a
newspaper. Sometimes their claws take root in
the cage bottom. Pigs, too (70 percent of them,
according to Hershaft of FARM), are increas-
ingly confined in small stalls with con-
crete floors that advocates say damage the
pigs’ feet and legs. The pigs, which even
farmers admit are naturally intelligent and
sociable animals, react to the discomfort and
boredom of continual confinement by biting
each other’s tails off. They also fall easy victim
to stress-related illness and death.

Cattle, more and more, are readied for mar-

ket in corral-like feedlots—far from the range—
where advocates say they are inadequately pro-
tected from the elements.

The cruelest and most unnecessary tech-
nique of modern animal farming, in the eyes of
advocates, is the production of milk-fed veal.
This involves tethering calves in wooden stalls
to keep them from turning around, and giving
them a diet calculated to produce anemia so
that their meat will be the desired pale tone.

The rights activists do offer some alterna-
tives. Lab animal advocates promote the use of
research and testing methods that do not in-
volve. animals. These alternative methods in-
clude substituting cell and tissue cultures and
mathematical and computer models.

The other side has answers to all this agita-
tion. Scientists say they would like to use
fewer animals—if for no other reason than al-

ternatives are cheaper—but unfortunately the ,

techniques are not available yet to replace the
great majority of them. Stopping all animal re-
search would, in effect, stop all research,
asserts William Samuels of the National Soci-
lety for Medical Research, because “only a
small part of it can be done (with alterna-
tives.)” (The reason researchers have opposed
'spending federal money to find alternatives,
Samuels says, is because they fear these funds
would come out of already “scarce,” existing

' government appropriations for research, in- ,

stead of new appropriations.)

Scientists Pth to the human (andanimal)
diseases that have been eradicated or success-
fully treated through the. use of animals, such
as polio and diabetes. The researchers main-
tain that duplication is necessary to achieve
creditable scientific results, and that the vast
majority of lab animals are humanely treated.

Scientists have recently taken the offensive,
accusing the animal rights advocates of basing
their charges of cruelty on isolated instances
and clairning‘for the scientific community the
banner of humanism in its simplest sense. An
op-ed article in the June 14 New York Times
by‘Lynn Morrison and Gerald S. Levey, mem-
bers of the Association of Professors of- Medi-
cine, wondered at the “opposition to using
animals—even rats and mice” in the effort to
cure diseases “which strike thousands of chil-
dren each year.” Samuels says, “I have trouble
placing an animal above a human.”

Animal rights activists claim human health
would actually be improved by the use of tech-
niques mare exact and reliable than animal
testing. The “chronic, degenerative diseases”
of today are not going to be cured by animal
experimentation as diseases caused by infec-
tions of the body were in the past, they say.

But animal advocates also talk about “chang-
ing. expectations.” “Too much research goes
on,” says Aaron Medlock of the New England
Anti-Vivisection Society. It is important to tell
people “‘you’re not going to live forever,”’
Medlock says. Michael Fox of the Humane
Society of the United States, claims “we have
to come to terms with our life and death anxie-
. ties” and stop expecting—or wanting—the
"medical-scientifie-priesthood" to eliminate
all suffering and dying from the world.

Farmers defend intensive animal agriculture

on the grounds that the animals are safer,

healthier and happier indoors in a tempera-
ture-controlled environment with automati-

cally-dispensed food and water and no fear of

predators. Moreoever, as Stuart Proctor of the
American Farm Bureau Federation says, “A
hog today, a chicken today, is not the same
animal that roamed the farm 30 years ago.”
Sedentary behavior has been bred in, he says.

An issue unrelated to research or farming,
but one that Hershaft calls “very hot” in the
movement today, is whether man has the right
to kill other animals even “for their own
good,” referring to some 15 million dogs and
cats that are killed each year in America’s
pounds and shelters. “Our concern for the
sanctity of life is unlimited,” says Hershaft of
himself and the others opposed to putting ani-
mals to sleep.

Newkirk, who in her job with the DC. gov-

 

;chance of at least seeing the light of day at a

_ cate to some extent” the legal standings of ani-

7 rights for animals, a field of law that has gained

 

ernment oversees the city’s shelter and who.
has taught animal euthanasia, says she finds

the task “very difficult” but-necessary. “I’d ‘

rather not have clean hands (and prevent unne-
cessary suffering) "than be ethically pure,” she
declares. Euthanasia’s defenders stress they
are working to eliminate the need far the prac-

tice through campaigns to control pet popula- _

tions.

The animal rights issue is already prominent
enough to have found its way into the political
and legislative arenas. In Europe, where the
movement is older, the Labor Party promises
Britons an end to fox hunting and other blood
sports, and the Swiss will vote later this year in
a nationwide referendum on an anti-vivisec-
tion measure. Over here, citizens of Massachu-
setts will decide this fall on a referendum to
bar labs from securing their research subjects
from pounds, and the Washington State De-
mocratic Convention recently approved an un-
precedented animal welfare resolution.

Most domestic animals are protected from
wanton cruelty by the laws of all 50 states, and
from less blatant forms of persecutiOn by the
laws in many of them. (Taub was convicted
under Maryland law.) On the federal level, the
principal piece of animal legislation is the Ani-
mal Welfare Act, which regulates many of the
businesses that handle animals but does not
cover farm animals or research animals during
experimentation. In the last few years there
have been a spate of measures introduced in
Congress intended to ﬂirther improve the con-
dition of lab animals, one of which is due for a
vote in the House this week. This amendment
to a bill authorizing funding for the National
Institute of Health contains “guidelines” (re-
searchers were able to exchange’this more pli-
ant word for the original “regulations”) that
call for better monitoring of animal care. But-
of more importance to the movement is the
historic inclusion in the bill of $20 million
over three years to search for alternative re-
search methods and to reduce the suffering of
animals used in the lab.

On the farm animal front, a bill was recently
introduced in the House to study the effects of
intensive farming, primarily its effects on man
and only incidentally the effects on the animals
themselves. The bill was referred to a_ health
subcommittee instead of the House Agricul-
ture Committee, giving it a- much better

hearing.

Harnessing the potential political power of .
- animal advocates and animal lovers for even

greater gain is the aim of two groups recently
organized by a former Congressional Fellow in
philosophy. Connie Kagan formed the Animal
Political Action Committee (AN PAC) last T
year, and the National Alliance for Animal Le-
gislation emerged from a Kagan-organized
conference on lobbying held last May. Kagan
says a direct-mail solicitation by a group in
California similar to ANPAC brought in
$10,000. '

Though AN PAC will stick to congressional
races next year, others within the movement
would like to pressure the presidential candi-
dates into formulating policy positions on ani-
mals, and get animal rights planks written into
the platforms of the political parties, as they
already are in Britain.

In addition to Taub’s second appeal of his
criminal conviction, there is a civil case involv-
ing the Silver Springs monkeys. A favorable de-
cision for PETA in this case, which was initi-
ated by the rights groups at the same time the
criminal procedings began, would in effect de-
clare the monkeys abused creatures and pro-
hibit their return to Taub, just as abused chil-
dren are protected from their parents. PETA
claims such a ruling would establish a land-
mark for animal rights; Attorneys for Animal
Rights chapter president Roger Galvin, who is
also an assistant state’s attorney for Montgom-
ery County, carefully concedes it “would indi-

mals. This “standing question,” whether or
not animals'can be represented in court, is the
key element in the struggle to establish legal

growing attention in recent years. _

What with all the philosophy, legislation
and litigation, it is sometimes hard to tell if '
animal rights advocates really like animals,
especially since Newkirk calls “animal lover”
a “denigrating and revolting term,” and Her-

shaft considers pet ownership a “mild form of '

oppression.” (Both opinions are widely shared
in the movement.) _

Perhaps the best way to tell if animal rights
advocates like animals is if animals like them.
Smokey is a gray cat “who sort of wandered in
and stayed around,” and who last month was
curled contentedly on a couch in Hershaft’s
house. She only runs away when Hershaf’t
tries to convert her to vegetarianism.

Bea, a black and brown Labrador-German
shepherd mixture, is one of the “animal refu- ‘
gees” in the Newkirk household. Newkirk
calls for greater respect on the part of humans
toward their animal companions, but she her-
self reports Bea’s last name as “quiet,” and

must sometimes prevent Bea from sharing her- ‘

rubber duck with visitors. Despite these re-
strictions, Bea seems high-spirited and very

Endangered animals studied

HARRlMAN — Second-g
grade students at Central
Elementary here have
been studying threatened
and endangered animals.

The students have seen
movies and filmstrips,
read books and articles,
and made their own books
with pictures to take home.

They have made posters
and wall murals and col~
lected money to donate to
the Greenpiece Organiza-
tion which works to protect
whales and seals.

The students visited the
Students’ Museum in Knox-
ville to see the display,

“Extinction Is Forever.”
They wrote letters to en-
courage friends and family
to help in some way.
During their study, the
students learned that there
are 20,000 to 25,000 plants
and close to 1,000 kinds of
animals that are threaten-
ed or endangered. Some
causes are continued hun-
ting or collecting and loss

of natural habitat due to.

the progress of civilization.

Room 200-1600 Avenue L
Brooklyn, New York 11230

Dear Mr. Resnick,

Dr. Orlans has forwarded your letter of April 10, 1982,
requesting 75 c0pies of several of our publications for
teachers. Under separate cover, we are sending you copies of
' the Publications and Films list, First Aid and Care of Small
Animals, but we cannot send such a supply of Humane Biology
Projects.

We are revising the latter publication and expanding
its theme. The new bodk is entitled, The Endangered Species
Handbook, and its text highlights the many problems faced by
animals being pushed to extinction. We also enlist the efforts
of the coming generation in the struggle to reverse this trend
with a section of projects for the classroom. The bodk is
now in press, and with luck will be available in July. I have
put your letter in our pending file, and when the bodk is
_ ready for distribution, you will be contacted.

Thank you for your interest in our work.
Sincerely,

Fran Lipscomb.

Nancy Davidson December 10 -]anuary 9, 1983
In the past year, the work of Nancy Davidson, Associate
Professor of Art at Williams College, has undergone a
distinct transformation. Abandoning the abstract style of her
preceding painting, Ms. Davidson’s work has assumed a clear
figurative orientation. This small exhibition, comprised of
works on paper and painting, will focus on the current
development of her work.

A reception for the artist will be held December 10,
from 6—7 pm. ,

Edward Koren: Prints and Drawings
December IO-Ianuary 9, 1983

Edward Koren has long been known for his pictorial parodies
of contemporary society which have been regularly
published in The New Yorker. This exhibition, which examines
his output from 1959-1981, is the first such in—depth
presentation of his work. Organized by The University Art
Gallery, SUNY/ Albany, this exhibition will make a two year
tour of eastern and west coast museums.

Next to Nature: landscape Paintings from the National Academy
ofDesign [anuary 16—March 13, 1983

Pittsfield Art league Annual Exhibition
December I 0- Ianaary 2

This year’s Pittsfield Art League Exhibition will culminate in
a juried exhibit from December 10-January 2. The works for
this show were chosen by a panel of jurors from the two
previous shows, an exhibit of watercolors and works on
paper from November 5-15, and an exhibit of oils/acrylics
and wood engravings from November 19—28. Sculpture was
also submitted for the first exhibit, and will remain on
exhibit through January 2.

On Friday, December 10, from 7-9 p.m., an Awards
Presentation and Gala Reception will be held.

Man's (Mis)Useof/lnimals:an exhibit
Ianaary 15 -Febraary Z 7
Advances in modern technology have given mankind the
option to either live ON or WITH his fellow creatures of
earth. In this exhibit, rarely displayed artifacts, decorative art
objects, posters and prints trace the evolution of our
dependance upon animals from necessity to frivolity.

Man’s earliest use of animals was for survival: food, clothing,
shelter, tools, weapons. Later, animal products provided
material for everyday objects, which then as now, could have
been made from non-animal sources or synthetics. At
present, entire species are nearing extinction to satisfy the
dictates of the fashion industry, the pet trade, and for
pseudo-medicinals, fertilizers and lubricating oils, among
others. .

We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of The Animal“,
Welfa.rg,1ﬂ§ti£gt§,.RARE, Inc., and Alpine Graphics for their
advice and for supplying us with the prints and posters
displayed.

WinterSpring Concert Series

D'Anna Fortanato December 6, 8 pm.
Praised by the New York Times for her ”striking vocal

. presence, musical intelligence and sheer tonal beauty of

sound,” Miss Fortunato is equally acclaimed for her
unusually broad repertory of orchestral, operatic oratorio
and chamber works. She has sung leading operatic roles with
a variety of major orchestras such as The Boston Symphony
Orchestra, the Detroit Symphony, and the Minnesota
Orchestra, as well as with the Opera Company of Boston.
Her major festival appearances include Marlboro,
Tanglewood, and the Bach Festival of Rome, Italy.

The New Yorker Magazine noted that her singing
encompasses ”delicate phrasing, dignity, expressiveness and
accuracy.” It is this controlled yet deeply emotional quality
that has made Miss Fortunato one of the most highly
respected soloists in the music world today.

The Williams Trio February 7, 8 pm.

The Williams Trio, comprised of cellist Douglas Moore,
violinist Jules Hegyi, and pianist Paula Ennis—Dwyer—
members of the Williams College Music Department
faculty— was founded by the college in 1970. Well known for
its musical precision and finesse, the ensemble not only
performs the complete range of standard repertory, but
actively commissions contemporary compositions as well.

This February, the group will present a program which
includes Mendelssohn’s Trio in D Minor, an ensemble work
by Tcherepnin, and a piece which the trio has recently
commissioned by contemporary composer, Christopher
Yavelow.

The Washington Post summed up the talents of these three
accomplished musicians succinctly: ”The concert was a
singular triumph for the Williams Trio. Not only did it
demonstrate the rich musical background that enables them
to bring such imagination to program content, but it
displayed to wonderful advantage their maturity, subtle
musicianship and technical brilliance.”

Single concert admission will be $55.50*.

WinterSpring Concerts are presented in cOoperation with
the Lichtenstein Foundation for Music and Art.

 




 

Children '5 Programs
Music and Motion and Makebelieve

A series of performing arts events for children, ”Music and
Motion and Makebelieve” is presented jointly by the
Museum and the Lichtenstein Foundation for Music and Art.
A limited number of single event tickets will be available at
the door for the remaining two performances.

Stromhergand Cooper
What’s more fun than a barrel of monkeys? The
comedy/mime team of Stromberg and Cooper” Two of the
most successful variety performers in New England today,
Bob Stromberg and Michael Cooper are a delightful blend of
music, mime, comedy and storytelling at its best—”personal—
style" theatre focusing on all facets of pantomime, dialogue,
monologue, original music and, of course, the art of having
fun! After their most recent appearance, TV’s P.M.
Magazine said ”Stromberg and Cooper’s talents as inventive
mimes are rare and a joy to the senses.” Without a doubt it is
this duo’s special brand of warmth on stage—along with
their non—stop shenanigans— that makes an afternoon with
Stromberg and Cooper just plain magic.

The series will conclude with a performance by The Danny
Sloan Dance Company on March 13 at 3:30 pm.

Music and Motion and Makebelieve programs are funded in
part by the New England Foundation for the Arts and are
presented in cooperation with the Lichtenstein Foundation
for Music and Art.

Admission for single performance will be $2.00*.

Curiosities in Mathematics

”Curiosities in mathematics,” an enrichment program for 7
and 8—year olds, will be held on Saturday mornings in
January from 10-11 a.m.

The workshop will expose children to the creative and
fascinating side of math as they explore our numerical
system in a new way.

The instructor for this program is Ms. Barbara Kenny of
Lenox. Dates are January 8, 15, 22 and 29.

The admission for these four workshops will be $20. '
Enrollment is limited to eight children.

February 6, 3 pm.

Holiday Art Workshops for Children

The Art Education Department will provide three Christmas
workshops for children to enrich their holiday season—
Monday, December 20; Tuesday, December 21; and
Wednesday, December 22 from 3:30-5 pm. at the Museum.
On Monday, Thelma Margulies, will help children make
Christmas ornaments from paper and foil; on Tuesday,
David Giannini will work with children to create poetry
about the winter season; and on Wednesday, Ms. Margulies
will direct children in designing Christmas cards appropriate
to the poetry and the season.

Children from ages 7-11 may enroll in all three workshops
for $10.00, or participate in separate workshOps for $3.50
each. Workshops will be limited to 15 children.

American Folk Caltare Enrichment Workshop

Begins February 7th, 3:30 p.m.

The Art Education Department will offer four workshops
for children ages 7-11, on American folk music, call dances,
and traditional American story—telling, from 3:30— 5:00 pm.
on four Mondays—February 7, 14, 28, and March 7.

These workshops, which will be led by Tim Van Egmond,
folk singer, story-teller, dance-caller, and instrument—
maker, are motivated by the special exhibit of 19th Century
American landscapes, ”Next to Nature: Landscape Painting
from the National Academy of Design,” which will be shown
at the Museum from January 15 through March 13.
Workshops will be held in the galleries of this exhibit to
illustrate similarities between American art, music, dance
and literature.

Admission to the four workshops is $20.00, and is limited to
twenty children.

Animal Hoar

Animal Hour, a nature study for first, second, and third-
graders will resume its Friday afternoon informal programs

Native American lecture Series

American Indian Art in German Museums
December 8, 7:30 p.m.

With his wife, Dr. Jill Leslie Furst, Dr. Peter Furst has
recently authored a book titled, ”North American Indian
Art.” It will be on sale at the museum on the evening of the
slide lecture. Authority on the Huichols of Mexico, Furst has
published several books on this field, and with his wife
authored a work on Pre-Columbian art. The Fursts spent
this past summer in Germany, where amongst other
projects, they researched the Native American collections.
Furst is currently professor of Anthropology at the State
University of New York at Albany.

WoodlandsIndian Music Ianuary 5, 7:30pm.

Professor of Anthropology and Music at Wesleyan
University, and one of the founders of the Society of
Ethnomusicology, David McAllester will give a concert and
discussion on the music of the Woodlands Indians.
McAllester is a leading authority on the music of the Navajos
of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. A trustee of the
American Indian Archeological Institute, Washington,
Connecticut, McAllester has recently devoted much of his
time to a study of Woodlands Indian Music.

Broken Treaty at Battle Mountain, a film narrated by
Robert Redford

This film effectively documents the story of the western
Shoshone in their struggle to keep 24 million acres of Nevada
land guaranteed to them by treaty. People explain and show
what being a traditionalist Shoshone‘means to them through
medicine practice, herb gathering, dance and prayer as well
as their attachment to their land. The government’s offers to
buy the lands only underscores the fact that the government
has no right over these lands. Within the Shoshone com-
munity, there is disagreement; some would sell their land
and others would not, on any terms. The Shoshone
viewpoint, especially that of the traditionalists, is very well
portrayed. They are frustrated with the government
bureaucracy and with the government destruction of trees
and wildlife on the contested land.

Environmental Education Department

Throughout the years, a number of different names have
been given to the Department of Environmental Education
here at the Museum. Since its founding in 1921 it has been
the Children’s Room, Nature Room, Junior Department and
finally, its current name. Although its name has changed, its
reason for being— to give the young people of Berkshire
County a Chance to experience science and natural history—
has remained unchanged. Programs in environmental
education will continue with emphasis on working with 4th
through 8th grade students at the weekly meetings of The
Junior Naturalist Club Wednesdays at 4 pm.

Our live animal exhibits should be a part of every group’s
visit to the Museum. Groups planning to visit should phone
ahead to schedule a live animal demonstration or brief talk
about the aquaria and its inhabitants.

Spring Travel Lecture Series

Our 32nd series of travel lectures will open March 12 when
Kathleen Dusek will present ”Belgium— Land of Two
People.” All programs will be on Saturdays at 8 pm. On
March 26 Dr. Arthur C. Twomey will show ”Canada’s
Western Frontier,” while Frank Klicar will present
”Yugoslavia After Tito” on April 9. The series concludes
April 23 with ”Great Cities,” with ”Rome,” narrated by
Anthony Burgess, and ”Stockholm,” narrated by Mai
Zetterling. While these internationally known authorities are
not appearing personally, these are outstanding films.

Series tickets remain at a modest $6.00*. As all tickets to our
fall series were sold, tickets should be ordered soon.

 

 




 

 

Corner Shop

beginning Tuesday, December 7th through Sunday,
December 12th. Everything in the shop will be discounted
except antiques and books. Museum members will receive an
additional 5% discount with the exception of items already

Special Museum Needs

The recent renovation of the European Gallery has returned
that gallery to the splendor of the original architectural
elegance. Acoustics and a broad expanse of hard pine flooring
suggest, however, that the addition of a carpet in the center
of the gallery would provide the necessary final touch to this
project.

If you have a large (at least 18’ x 24’) oriental carpet which
still has some life left, but which you can no longer use,
please consider a tax-deductible donation to the Museum. It
will complete our restoration and will be appreciated by
many.

*Admission rates are for Museum members. Rates for the
general public are slightly higher.

The Museum is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 am.

to 5 p.m., and from 1:00-5:00 on Sundays. There is no
admission charge.

Brooke’s Bikini

“Brooke Brings Back the Bikini”

{February}? I was not aware the

bikini had gone but hoped that by
now little Brooke would have!

Why didn’t you reveal the face of

In your story on Barney Clark you

colleague Dr. Stephen Jacobson,
who should be so credited.

The View from Here

In response to Loudon Wain—
wright’s “Charity Begins with the
Homeless,” I wonder, can we real—
ly aﬁord indiscriminate charity?

To give money, or to feel guilt
for not giving it, is a slap to those
who are still ﬁghting the battle to
better themselves. Is it really the
fault of “those who have” that
there exist “those who have not”?
Is it really true that “there but for
the grace of God go I,” or is it
“there but for my refusal to give
up go I”? Isn’t that my decision
and isn’t it theirs?

Isn’t it better to give the money
to those who want to work but
can’t ﬁnd jobs? By passing Mr.
Grayface by, perhaps Wainwright
gave him a glimpse of a man still
ﬁghting.

I have enjoyed and appreciated
Loudon Wainwright’s columns
for some time, even though I have
not always agreed with them. His
most recent, however, is right on
the mark.

Sly Stallone

Neil Leifer’s photograph of Syl-
vester Stallone aboard his yacht
leaves me and all the other legal
secretaries in this ofﬁce absolute-
ly speechless. It now graces the
wall above my typewriter and
has given me inspiration to type
even the most boring of docu-
mentation.

Janelle Coﬂin

If the object of the Brooke Shields
story was to bring back the bikini,
you missed the beach. Sly Stal-
lone did more for the garment in
one picture than Brooke did in 10.

Camera at Work

What William Wegman did to his
dog, Man Ray, in “A Dog’s Life”
was cruel and inhumane. Anyone
who would tie up a dog with yarn
in order to photograph him is sick!

Tom Parker

You failed to mention that Man

Ray was an occasional guest on

the original Saturday Night Live. I

am sure his many fans mourn his
passing.

Mr. Wegman does have a way

with dogs. He’s ﬁnally bringing

credit to a beautiful breed—the

Weimaraner.

I offer my two gray beauties to
carry on the tradition.

Indian Fishing Rights

Your article “Feuding Over Fish”
was upsetting to me and, I hope, to
many other whites as well.

We took the American Indians’
land, forced them to live on reser-
vations, stripped them of their
culture and killed them by the
tens of thousands. Now white
sport ﬁshermen want to starve
them as well. Could this be the ﬁ-

nal humiliation—to take away

their meager ﬁshing rights? The
Quileute Indians of Washington
are ﬁshing for their survival. and
weekenders are ﬁshing for sport.
If the Quileute Indians are
catching and selling salmon and
steelhead trout for proﬁt, more
power to them! If the sportsmen
would practice a little more
sportsmanship and compassion,
then maybe, just maybe, we could
justify our white pride as Ameri-
cans. After all, our hallmark as a
nation and as a society rests on
our respect for individuals and
our sense of fairness for all!
Tom Allessio
New York, N .Y.

You wrongly perpetuate the myth
that the sport ﬁsherman and Indi-
ans are bitter enemies. The truth
is they are united by love of the

 

 

Dallas and Monty model the latest in hats.

axvuo NNA‘I‘ '9 Nb

 

steelhead; the Indians as part of
their livelihood and native heri-
tage and the sportsmen because it

. is one of the ﬁnest game ﬁsh avail~

able. Both sides only want and de—

serve their fair share.

Indians and non-Indians are
usually portrayed as enemies,
while the real culprits. the dam
builders, the logging companies
and the polluters, bear none of the
responsibility.

Larry W. Henry, M.D.

High-Tech Farming

Your article was unjust, incorrect
and tOtally misleading. The veal
industry is small, new and trying
desperately to educate Americans
about modern farming.

Our farm is not a factory, nor is
it automated. Our calves do not
spend 16 weeks in darkened
stalls; they certainly aren’t ane-
mic, nor are they tortured.

Phil, Sue and Chad Wesa .
J efferson, Wis.
> Our story made clear that Phil
Wesa feels he is not guilty of cruel
treatment. Nevertheless, the Ani—
mal Welfare I nstitute states that
calves kept in closed crates and
fed only twice a day from buckets
are never able to lie down to
stretch their legs, to suckle, or to
develop naturally—ED.

Your article was great. While a
signiﬁcant portion focused on the
harmful eifects some meats can
have on humans, an equally pow—
erful part dealt with the inhu-
mane treatment that constitutes a
farm animal’s life.

Being an animal rights activ-
ist, I am relieved to see LIFE reveal
the truth behind “the red, barn
and green ﬁelds ﬁlled with gentle
grazing cattle”—a picture so many
of us grew up on. ,

K. Winkler
Richmond, Va.

American farmers. are the most
humane and eﬂicient in all of his
tory. If you want a really accurate
picture of agriculture, show what
happens in the real animal world

. with these good caretakers.

If the wishes of “animal rights
advocates” were followed. we
would all survive on a diet of
ground corn and water as do a
large number of people in the
world today.

NESTLES ‘ ‘- ' ‘ ' -

‘ INFACT has targetted Taster's Choice instant coffee in their boycott effort.
This makes sense, as instant drinks account for the largeSc share of Nestle’ 5 sales
here ~ about 28%. And although we can't ever remember doing this before, we'd like
to recommend a substitute.; It's Kava instant coffee, made by Borden. It tastes as
good as Taster's choice, but its 90% acid free and therefore should be healthier.

The jar says to use a teaspoon per cup but our editor says % teaspoon works just fine.

Nestle is pruning many of its operations. "heavy leases - in Argentina because of
the economic crisis there and the sharp drOp in the value of the country'Sccurrency in ‘
1980, and the United States the year after because of the developing recession and the
high cost of restructuring companies Nestle had acquired there - forced Nestle to thin out.
Additionally, the company has been the target for a number of years of adverse‘
5 publicity involving its marketting of baby formula in deveIOping countries...

New Entries

As 1983 gets underway, and more and more Americans are discovering that they are
peconomically disposable, the tactics of Opposition groups become more and more important
.in proportion.. We'd like yen to consider boycotts to be some of the base notes on

a tactical 'piano'. Notes that don't and shouldn't form the melody, but constantly

. This boycott is something new under the sun - anhauser-Busch is being boycotted
because of what it has ESE done rather than hacause of some transgression. In so many
words, Operation Push is telling Anhauser Busch that if they want Black peoples’
business they must give Black people an economic Stake in the corporation, For examples,
they want AhhausernBusch to give Blacks a fair percentage of its wholesale diatributorships
( out of 950 Busch distributorships only two are operated by Blacks) and Black newspapers
a better share of their advertising. . ' ‘ '- , '

It's new too because it's perceiving a corporation as an 'ahuman? entity - an
entity that can provide specifics (like trade and jobs) but cannot take~on a human
role, like sympathy. As PUSH's spokesperson, Rev. Jesse Jackson said, "We're in the
_early morning of the Black American struggle for corporate America dialog...we simply
want economic reciprocity. We do not want from them social generosity. During this
era of moving from aid to trade and charity to parity we must demand a fair return on

THE JOURNAL OF COMMERCE. Tuesday, March l, 1983

,. Whallng Japanese Attitude Akin to Ahab’s

f1

(New York City),,g.

By A. E. CULLISON
Journal of Commerce Staff

TOKYO — For four deadly hours
last week, a group of eager Japanese
fishermen battled 60 black whales in
Nachi Bay (about 76 miles south of
Osaka) on Japan’s Pacific coast
before finally slaughtering all of
them. The whales, ranging from three
to five meters in length and weighing
from 500 to 800 kilograms, had been
spotted at sea the previous night and
promptly driven into the bay’ 5 shal-
low waters.

Commented one Tokyo daily in a
photo caption: The haul was estimat-
ed at worth about $40,000 and the
whales were landed after putting up a
vigorous fight— much to the delight
of tourists lining the beach. The
caption, quite obviously, offers an
extraordinary contrast between the
Japanese view of whaling and that of
the West.

Although there was no direct
connection, of course, three days
following destruction of the whales
the United States government warned
the Japanese Washington might be
forced to significantly reduce Japan’s
fish catch quota in the 200-mile
exclusive fishery zone maintained by
the United States if Tokyo fails .to
further reduce or eliminate whaling
activities entirely.

The warning, delivered by a U. S.
delegation during informal talks con-

cerning whaling being held in the

Japanese capital, stressed that the
Reagan administration would appre-
ciate it if Japan would seriously
reconsider its petition (filed last
November) to the International Whal-
ing Commission in favor of continuing
the harvesting of such mammals.

The commission had adopted a
resolution in July calling for an
outright ban on all commercial whal-
ing after three years.

The American group informed the
Japanese of mounting pressures
throughout the United States from
environmentalist organizations seek-
ing revocation of petitions to the
commission by such whaling coun-
tries as Japan, Peru, Norway and the
Soviet Union.

In reply, the Japanese argued that
apparently there remains a large
whale population and problems con-
cerning their possible extinction will
not exist as long as whaling is
carefully conducted on the basis of
scientific data.

However, Washington’ 5 delegation
punctuated its remarks by noting that
the United States last December
allowed Japan to catch 570, 000 tons of
fish (or 50 percent of the Japanese
annual quota) in the ZOO-mile zone up
until the end of this month. The

Japanese were then reminded that the

remaining 50 percent is to be allocat-
ed in two equal installments in April
and July.

Moreover, the U. S. team stressed
that continued defiance by Japan of
the commission’s popular ruling could
cause considerable trouble in Amer-
ica ’5 Congress. There is already a
group of Washington legislators call-
ing for strict retaliation against Japan
in the form of a drastic reduction in
the Japanese fish catches in Ameri-
can waters.

Whatever happens, it is considered
likely that the US. delegation to the
International Whaling Commission’s
general meeting in July will propose a
very sharp decrease in Japan’s whale
catch quotas for 1983 and 1984. This 18
the absolute least to be expected.

Thus the stage has been set for
more economic and political (plus
highly emotional) frictions between
Washington and Tokyo in the weeks
and months ahead. Whatever the
ultimate outcome, it does not appear
that Japan can benefit in any way
from the upcoming clashes.

Justifiably or not, the Japanese
contend that whaling is a traditional
industry of their country which today
directly employs around 1,300 men
and women and affecting about 50,000
or more other workers in related
industries.

'It is also the objection of the
Japanese that'the commission’s mor-
atorium on all whaling after 1986
lacks a sufficient scientific data base.
The ban, for instance, assumes that

various species of whales are serious- .

 

ASIA VIEW

1y endangered by commercial whal-
ing. The Japanese do not agree with
this grim conclusion.

Yet whatever the truth of the

‘ matter, “save the whales” organiza-

tions throughout North America and
Western Europe clearly have been
spoiling for such a confrontation for
years now, ngg with Japan but
also with the other - commercial
whaling nations. “

'Phe AnimalD Welfare nstitute of
Washington, is? example,
claims “the W8 have already
pushed‘most' whale species to the
brink of extinction. Now they are
endangering the last of the exploited
species.”

In fact, the institute only recently
reminded that only a decade ago the
United Nations called unanimously
for a moratorium on all commercial
whaling, “but the whalers have
slaughtered more than 300,000 of the
giant marine mammals since then.”

Nevertheless, the Japanese view is
entirely different, insisting indignant-
ly that the “self-righteous non-whal-
ing nations” have absolutely no right
to attack the wholesale killing of
these mammals since there is no solid
scientific proof that the existence of
the whales is really threatened. They
point out, for instance, that many jobs
already have been lost to the once-
booming industry, with whaling now
reduced to only four Pacific coast
towns in Japan.

Though such an argument concern-
ing just four small towns involved
would seem to support those opposed
to whaling — such as the Greenpeace
activists - the Japanese tend to insist
repeatedly that the Americans and
Europeans are trying to impose for-
eign values upon Japan and to dis-
count Japan’s interest in whale meat
as a valuable source of protein.

They also are busy stressing that
the commission regularly resorts to
skewed statistics to assemble ITW
strict quotas in favor of the conserva-
tive-minded environmentalists.

 
 
 

For both parties, those throughout .

the world in favor of ending all
commercial whaling and those in
Japan and elsewhere supporting the
continued killing of the mammals, the
issues are highly emotional. If any-
thing, tempers are likely to become
even more heated. Bad feelings are
certain to be generated as foreign
pressures build, at least until neces-
sary diplomatic compromises can be

worked out. '

Under this constant drumbeat of
criticism, there is evidence that the
Japanese public, not to mention their
government and Tokyo’s powerful
bureaucracy, is becoming increasing-
ly irritated at the constantly escalat-
ing demands from the United States
and Europe that Japan open up to
more foreign imports and spend much
more on defense.

The common complaint is that the
West never seems to be satisfied with
Japan’s so often unilateral conces-
sions —- and perhaps actually is
jealous of Japanese economic and
industrial successes over the past 30
years.

Ironically, the angry mood of the
bitter Japanese under these circum-
stances comes at a time when the
nation’s tiny whaling industry is even
now on its last legs. The industry
currently is less than a tenth of its
size of just 20 years ago providing
only 0.5 percent of the country’s
annual marine production.

No one is more keenly aware of
the stakes involved, of course, than
Japan’s fishing industry which now
takes around 70 percent of the
nation’s marine products from the
US. ZOO-mile exclusive fishing zone.

Even Motonobu Inagaki, president
of the Japan Whaling Association,
admits that the Japanese industry
rests upon a yearly consumption by
the Japanese people of only about
43, 000 tons of whale meat. Therefore,
it would seem incredible that the
people of Japan evidently are willing
to risk a major confrontation with its
largest trading partners over a mat-
ter of principle. Still, as of the
moment, that would appear to be the
case.

 

 




 

ASIAWEEK, MARCH ll, 151K]

 

VIEWPOINTS

 

 

Time to Stop the Whale Hunt?

 

KUNIO YONEZAWA

‘There is no scientiﬁc truth
in allegations about danger to
whale species that are hunted’

 

 

 

Does Japan really need whale products? Eskimos hunt
whales because it is vital to their diet, but the Japanese would
surely not feel the loss.

Whaling is as deeply imbedded a tradition in our culture
as it is for Eskimos. This argument assumes that in a modern
society a person can easily find an alternative profession in
which his skills and experience would be just as effective or
in which he could take just as much pride. No person has the
right to tell another to give up his lifelong profession without
legitimate reasons.

isn’t it true that there are non-whale derived substitutes
for every whale-based product, many of them cheaper?

No, it is not true/Whale meat is whale meat. Anyway,
the question is a side-issue to the real issue of wise use of
whale resources and the question of freedom of creed and
profession.

For every Japanese marine biologist with arguments to
support whaling, there is a scientist elsewhere who opposes
it. if the question of extinction is uncertain, isn’t it better to
desist?

There is absolutely no scientific truth in allegations
about danger to whale species that are hunted. The scientific
committee of the international Whaling; Commission — the
overwhelming majority of which come from non- or anti-
whaling countries —- ruled in 1980 that on the basis of
international research, the minke whale population in the
southern hemisphere is “robust.”

Why does Japan keep on whaling when almost every
other country has abandoned it?

The question is irrelevant since Japan is not a tota-
litarian country. It is the livelihood of people involved in the
industry and their families that we are concerned about. It is
unjust and unfair to attempt to force the Japanese people to
stop whaling when there is no scientific justification for it.

Even if it were proved that certain species of whales are
not endangered, shouldn’t such a splendid sea mammal be
left unmolested?

Hunting wild animals is a popular sport in the United
States and elsewhere. Killing animals for fun or sport is
considered inexcusable in many Asian countries. Ethics
should be left to the judgement of individual nations and to
individuals involved. It is my firm view that the wise use of
natural resources of the sea should not be denied to those
who need them and have a tradition of using them.

Kunio Yonezawa is chief Japanese representative to the
International Whaling Commission.

 

 

KENNETH SEARLE

‘The Japanese have consistently
ignored the majority opinion of
the 1 WC scientific committee. ’

lf whales are critically endangered, why don't conserva~
tlonists mount campaigns against Eskimos, who are allowed
to hunt whales just because they have always done so?

It is not true to say that there is no opposition to the
Eskimo bowhead whale hunt. There have been years of
controversy, dissension and discussion over this and a great
deal of public money has been spent in trying to find a
solution. The problem is not yet solved.

Japanese officials say there is no exact substitute for
whale meat in the Japanese diet. Is this true?

Whale meat currently constitutes only .Ol% of protein
consumed in Japan. There is also evidence that the price ot~
whale meat is falling because of low demand. Whether or not
there is an exact substitute therefore becomes somewhat
irrelevant.

Many Japanese marine biologists say that with the
benefit of modern ocean-resources management. certain
species of whales can be taken without further depletion of
stocks. Are they misinformed?

This has been one of the tragedies of the lnternationné
Whaling Commission. The Japanese have consistenth
ignored the majority opinion and recommendations of the:
lWC scientific committee. To that extent they are certainly
misinformed.

Are the Japanese unreasonable when they accuse
Europeans and Americans of hypocrisy for banning whaling

’ only after it became unprofitable for them to hunt?

No, this is a valid criticism. it is true that the European
nations and the Americans only stopped whaling because the
whale populations that they had exploited became “commer-
cially extinct.” What world opinion now feels is that this
should not happen to the remaining whale populations.

if it were proved conclusively that whale populations
could be maintained in conjunction with commercial culling,
would you still oppose whaling? '

it is true that whales are a renewable resource, unlike,
say, coal or oil. The proposal before the IWC (which the
Japanese have lodged an objection to) is for a ten-year
moratorium on commercial whaling. Thereafter it may well
be that properly managed whale populations can be
harvested. It is estimated that just one species, the fin whale,
could provide enough meat to feed more than 12 million
people a year. The sad fact is that hitherto no whale
populations have been properly managed.

Kenneth Searle is a trustee member and member of the
executive council for the World Wildlife Fund (Hongkong).

would provide material for everyday objects. Today, many

entire species are nearing extinction to satisfy the dictates

Ordered by Congress to improve the 3welfare of

say the regulations range from “beneath bare min-

Among many other things, the proposed rules

cases, “there is no evidence that

the animals,” she said. “We better
be right. It will cost billions.”

“We have never seen such a con-

who use animals, those who supply
ii...” animals, others involved in the ex-
ifijierimentation community to pro-
tect every penny of their liveli-
hood,” said Ingrid Newkirk, co-
founder of People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals. Newkirk de-
scribes herself as an abolitionist,
“working for the day when there
will be no animals in cages.”

“One thing we can say for cer-
jtain,” said Larry Horton, associate
vice president for public affairs at
Stanford University, “is there are
certain elements in the animal-ac-
tivist community that, while claim-
ing moderation, want to stop and
impede research. The true moder-
ates on this issue are the medical
scientists who are highly regu- ‘
lated—certainly not unfettered
people who believe in a divine right
, to abuse animals.”

Dale Schwindaman, assistant
deputy administrator for animal
- "Care at APHIS, said a task force is

. ments on the latest set of regula-
2ti0ns as three veterinarians read

dealers, exhibitors, auction oper-
ators, research facilities and trans—
porters of animals. Animals are de-
fined as “any live or dead dog, cat,
. nonhuman primate, hamster or rab-
1 bit.”

' Mice and rats, by far the most
"commonly used animals in biomed-
' ical research, are not covered by
the rules. Newkirk is among 1,017
individuals or groups who com-
plained of the‘ department’s failure
to inelude rodents.

‘ “All animals who are used must
be covered,” she. said. “It doesn’t
matter to the'animals whether their
blood is warm or cold, whether they
are big or small, ugly or attractive.

The? all are entitled to minimal pro-
tectifon. ”

i

The American Council on Edu-

cation, a group of] research univers

sities, called the rules a “classic ex-
ample of regulatory overreach. ”

Michael Horowitz, counsel for
the group, Wrote that the regula-
tions “contain precise specifications
for such micromanagement details
as animal socialization; daily petting
in certain circumstances;
room; exercise periods and individ-
ualized supervision and caging (in-
cluding mandatory cage specifica-1
tions and toys appropriate for par-
ticular species).”

Thomas E. Hamm Jr., director of
Stanford’s division of laboratory an-
imal medicine, said the regulations
could eat up $1 billion to $2 billion
of the $10 billion to $14 billion~ in

 

play -

ical research.
“We are providing the best an-

" imal care possible based on current
data,” Hamm said. “We would have .

to throw away our current cages

, and spend half a million dollars on

new caging alone that will net ben-
efit dogs one iota.

“The average lay person can see
that [the idea of] grouping animals
together was written by people who
have never worked with groups of
animals,” he said. “Animals estab-
lish pecking orders. They are fight-
ing constantly. Any time one be-
comes ill or weak, the rest gang up
on him. It would be inhumane to
group them together.”

Stevens, a primary lobbyist for

total budget for American biomed-

the animal-welfare community,
called it perfectly possible to pro-
vide for both the exercise of dogs
and the psychological well-being 0f
primates without great expense

.“Usually primate! cages are two

tiers high. You can take the ceiling
out of one and the floor of another.
This can be done right in the shop
of most institutions.

“Primates have to be compati-
ble,” Stevens said. “Not every pri-
mate likes every other primate, but
the vast majority of primates very
much like to have a cage mate.
They groom one another and hud-
dle together. They like to spend a

lot of time chewing on branches. -

These are the kinds of things we
want to see happening.”

As Ior dog exerciSe, she said “It

. is not something that requires Sci-

entific proof. Everybody knows
dogs don’t want to sit in cages for
years and years. It’s not even a
question.”

Stevens said that to comply with
the rules, an institution Could pro-

, vide large pens or kennel runways,

or when people “clean the cages
they can simply lift the dog out on
the ﬂoor of the room or in a sepa-
rate exercise area in the corridor

and let him run around while the ‘

cage is cleaned.”

“We can’t make them exercise,”
Stanford’s Hamm said. “When we
let them out of the cages during
cleaning, they lie down in the cor-
ner and go to sleep ”

4 Big Conservation Groups

Drop Anti -Wha]1ng Boycott

By PETER J. BERNSTEIN

Newhouse News Service

1 WASHINGTON — Environmen-
talists are in a whale of a dilem-
ma: Should they continue a 4—
year-old boycott of Japanese and
Russian-made consumer products
to protest large-scale commercial
whaling?

Four‘ national environmental
groups With a combined member-
ship exceeding five million are no
longer participating in the boy«
cott: the Sierra Club, National
Audubon Society, Friends of the
Earth and National Wildlife
Federation. They suspended their
role in the boycott when Japan
and the SOviet Union agreed earli-
er this month to respect quotas on
whale hunting.

But 16 other environmental
groups are maintaining the boy-
cott. They are urging their mem—
bers to stop buying autos, cam-
eras, television sets and other
goods imported from the two
countries.

“The boycott basically is a
symbol of protest against interna-
tional whaling,” said John Gleib-
er of the Washington-based Ani-
mal Welfare Institute. “We be;
lieve there ought to be a
temporary moratorium on all
commercial whaling to give the
creatures an opportunity to breed
and allow their stocks to replen-
ish. '

The boycotting groups general-
ly voiced sharp disapproval of
actions on whale hunting taken
earlier this month at a meeting in
Tokyo of the 17-nation Interna-
tional Whaling Commission. The
IWC, despite resistance from the
United States and several other
member countries that no longer
allow commercial whaling, lifted
its ban on hunting of the endan-
gered bowhead whale and raised
its 1978 Quota on sperm whales

that may be hunted 1n the north-
ern Pacific.

The sperm Whale Quota, Which
had been cut to 763 at an IWC,
meeting la'St June, was bobsted to
6,444 at the Tokyo session -—- re-
pertedly under pre‘s'Sure frOm
both Japan and the Soviet Union.

“Several of us in the U. S. dele-
gatiOn would have liked to keep
the lid on bowhead hunting and
Stick to the low quota on sperm
whales that we set in Camberra
(Australia) last June,” Said
Thomas L Kimball, executive
vice president of the National
Wildlife Federation. “But the
IWC’ 5 Scientific committee re-

 

Groups still boycotting
worry increasingly
about illicit whaling.

 

vised its June estimate of the
number of Sperm whales that
might be taken and Japan and
Russia said they would abide by
the new limits.”

While the new quota on sperm
whales is more than eight times
greater than the permissible
catch set at the Canberra meet-
ing, it’s still below the 7,200 figure
the IWC established last year for
1977.

“Both Japan and the Russians
are now in the position of support-
ing whale management proce-
dures adopted by the IWC,” Kim-
ball said, “and so our
organization (the National Wild-
life Federation) cannot, in good
conscience, continue to call for a
boycott of their goods.”

“The groups that drOpped the
boycott were never very active to
begin with,” countered Barbara
Twigg of Monitor Inc, an umbrel-
la group that coordinates the boy.
cott.

  

But she acknowledged that the
split in the environmental move-
ment was “a little worrisome ”
It’ 3 going to mean that the re-
maining groups will have to
“redOuble” their efforts, she said.

Some of the groups still partici-
pating in the boycott want it to
focus on particular commercial
firms in Japan rather than
against all Japanese goods. They
cited one Japanese whaling firm
that sells large quantities of king
crab 1n the United States

In addition to their dismay over
higher quotas for bowhead and
sperm whales, environmentalists
are concerned about increasing
evidence of illicit whaling by
countries that are not parties to
the IWC convention. One such
country is Chile, reportedly using
Japanese whaling experts as
advisers. ' _

Some whaling ships are said to
be operating under different flags
from one week to the next in
order to esca e international
detection. And t ere are reports
that outlaw whaling ships are
hunting the extremely rare blue
whale off the Pacific coast of
South America and selling their
products to commercial firms in
Japan. '

Environmental groups still par-
ticipating in the boycott of con-
sumer goods made in Japan and
the Soviet Union are Defenders of

By c‘AROL WILLIAMS
Associated Press Writer
NEW YORK (AP) -— They
free do 5 and rats from Cali-
fornia aborator cages and
thwart British unters and
fishermen with bleating
horns in forests and sonic
devices in streams. They are
animal activists, and they

say animals have rights.

Every day, worldwide, ani-
mals are sprayed, injected,
cut open, stitched up or fed
noxious substances in experi—
ments. Others are slain for
food and sport.

The question of whether an-
imals have rights has
aroused emotional debate in
many countries. On the ani-
mals’ side are peo le who
oppose hunting, 1a ratory
experiments and, in some
cases, meat—eating.

But researchers claim such
thinking would hobble efforts
to conquer disease and radi-
cally change human eating
and survival habits.

Although animal advocacy
takes on different forms, a
major focus of the debate is
medical research, which re-
lies heavily on animal exper-
iments. The crux of the
controversy is whether
man’s need to learn su-

ersedes concern for animal

ife, an issue that opens a
Pandora’s box of problems.

“As soon as you start pick;
ing at the edges of this sore,
you start getting into a
whole realm of issues, like
meat-eating,” said Duke
University anthro olo ist
Matt Cartmill, who as one
extensive work on man’s re-
lationship to nature.

“Why is it justifiable to
inflict pain for Epicurean

values, when you’re con-
cerned about laboratory ani-
mals?” he asked. “Yet no
one is proposing legislation
outlawing meat—eating.”

The moral questions in—
volved in human domination
of other animals make legis-
lation of animal rights diffi-
cult, said Dr. Judith
Hampson of England’s Royal
Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals. The
RSPCA, founded in 1824, was
the first official or anization
in the world de icated to
protecting animals from
man’s abuse. ‘ .
“These are very difficult
problems. They , are subjec-
tive and can’t be written-into
the law,” she said in a tele-
phone interview from
RSPCA’s "headquarters in
Horsham, England.

US. animal welfare advo-
cates, however, are seeking
to at least bring American
regulation of animal re-
search up to the level of
some other Western nations,
like Sweden and Britain.
Current US. 're ulations
are “grossly ina equate,”
said Michael Giannelli, a
clinical psychologist and sci—
ence adviser for The Fund
for Animals.

The regulations specify
storage and transportation
conditions but do not restrict
how research is conducted,
Giannelli said. Eighty per-
cent of the animals used in
lab work - rats, mice,
birds, ﬁsh, amphibians, rep-

tiles and farm animals —— ~

are not covered by the 1967
Animal Welfare Act, Gian~
nelli said.

Sweden has an advisory
committee to review re-

search proposals and chan-
nel any that involve painful
procedures to an ethics re-

view board, where reviewers

and researchers .work to
minimize animal suffering in
the experiment.

Some US. institutions have
voluntarily adopted internal
review committees to handle
moral questions. Such panels
would be required for all
research institutions under a
proposed amendment, spon-
sored by Sen. Robert Dole,
R-Kan., to the Animal Wel-
fare Act. But adoption of
such changes is a long way
off, according to animal wel-
fare advocates and those
representing research inter-
ests.

Public pressure, however,
can succeed where legisla.
tion is lackin , said Hen
Spira of the
mals.

Two procedures in which

und for Ani-’

commercial products were
tested on animals, the Lethal
Dose 50 and the Draize tests,
have virtually disappeared
because of adverse publicity
generated by animal rights
supporters, Spira said.

The LD50 was used to set
toxicity levels. The test es-
tablished the level by deter-
mining the amount of a
substance needed to kill 50
percent of the research pop-
ulation. Animal rights activi-
tists argued the test had no
value to society and caused
unnecessary animal deaths.

The Draize test involved
dropping concentrated cos-
metic ingredients into rab-
bits’ eyes to determine levels
at which the substances
would damage the eyes.
Most cosmetics companies
dro ped the test when ani-
ma supporters threatened to
publicize the practice.

 

   

Neal 'Miller, a researcher
and former president of the
American Psychological As-
sociation, said he, like most
researchers, opposed unnec-
essary animal suffering “but
my view is that it is immoral
and cruel and inhuman to
try to stop the research that
has produced such advances
in animal and human care.”

Eqpating animal rights
wit human rights is a mis-
take, said Miller, a psycholo-
gist at Roc e’feller
University in New York.

“If (that view) had been
really pushed forward as
vigorously as extreme ele
ments want to do it, people
would still be suffering from
rabies, and we wouldn’t have
vaccine for olio or diphth-
eria or meas es.” -
Mice, chimpanzees and
monkeys have played criti-
cal roles in t e research
successes of the national
Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta.

“Most of the work the CDC
does with animals concerns
our responsibility in the di-
agnosis of infectious dis-
eases,” said Dr. Gary Noble,
assistant director for science
at the CDC. “Producing im-
mune serum which will rec-
ognize specific infectious
agents requires the intact
immune system of a healthy
animal.

“We use chickens and fer-
rets to produce diagnostic
sera against new strains of
influenza. We use many,
many mice, which we
produce ourselves, for the
purpose of making immune
serum against virtually any
infectious agent that is
known, anything from

 

tes Question of Animal Rig

chicken pox to rabies to ma.
laria to Legionnaires’ Dis-
ease. '
“Without the use of chim«
anzees, we wouldn’t have
een able to develop. the
knowledge we now have to
screen b ood donors and pre-
vent he atitis transmission
or deve op the vaccine for
hepatitis B virus which is
now available,” Noble said.
Another part of the debate
concerns which animals
should be protected.
Researchers previously as.
sumed only warm-blooded
vertebrates had nervous s s-
tems com lex enough to eel
pain, sai John McArdle of
the Humane Society of the
United States. But a few
years ago scientists discovv
ered that endorphins, the
painorelieving substances
naturall produced by
warm»b ied creatures, are
also produced by earth—
worms.

“Where on the evolutionary
scale do you draw the line of
concern?” asked McArdle,
who said he left his medical
school professorship at the
University of Illinois after
becoming disillusioned with

.attitudes toward animal sub-

jects.

What some animal rights
activists see as widespread
indifference to the lab ani-
mal’s plight has prompted
vigilante actions.

More moderate animal wel~
fare advocates are focusing
their attention on small, in-
cremental im rovements in
the lot of the b animal.
“We acce t the fact that
there will ave to be some
experimentation involving
animals until alternatives

 
    
  
  
  
  

  
   
   
   
  
   
 
  
     
  
   
  
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
   
 
    
  
 
 
  
 
   
  
  
   
  
 
   
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  

are developed,” said Mary
Knopke of the American Hu-
mane Societ .

The Anima Welfare Insti-
tute and the Humane Society
of the United States take
similar stands against in-
flicting pain on animals
wherever possible, but ac-
cept that important medical
research sometimes requires
animal sacrifice.
