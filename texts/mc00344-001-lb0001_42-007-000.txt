éﬁFLEA'FOR RUMANE TREAEﬁENT O? AﬁlhﬁLﬁ USED FQR VIVEﬁECTION

Suppose one day you come out of anesthesia to find your head
immobilized in an instrument which consisted of-a steel bar in
either ear, another in either eye, and yet another which holds your
mouth open. These bars placed firmly in each aperture hurt. But you
cannot move a muscle or make a sound. Iou cannot get the relief
screaming gives as a slight outlet for pain. You cannot let the
people around you know of your agony because you are paralyzed by
a “muscle relaxant“.

Then the doctor turns on the electrical current which hits a
nerve in your tooth. This is not an accident. The doctor planned
it that way. he wants to find out which portion the the brain re—
acts to this treatment. He wants to find out, if several portions
react, which portion reacts the strongest.

Anyone who has had this experience in a dentist's chair knows
how painful it is.

The doctor is not concerned about your pain. he wants to be
very sure of his findings. Regardless of your pain, he turns the
current on, not just once but as many times as he thinks it necess-
ary to give him the answer he is looking fer. his job is to find out
how the brain reacts. If he is an insensitive man, and there are
plenty of them, he Goesn't care at all how much you suffer.

{cu think this is a horror that couldn't possibly happen? You
are wrong. This and other experiments happen to untold millions of
animals every year, as we shall see.

Unless this experiment is conducted by experienced men it causes
extreme suffering to the animal. It has been known to cause permanent

deafness. Simply because the instrument has not been placed correctly

 




in the eyes and ears.

a simple illustration. When I had scarlet fever my doctor took

a culture of my throat. It was a completely painless experience. In
the hospital a young interns did the same thing. I thought he was
cutting my throat it hurt so. Just the difference between a man who
knows his business and one who doesn't.

During the war atomic experiments of all Kinds were being made.
a friend of mine served, as long as she could stand it, in a Govern~
sent post in Washington, D.C. Requests for funds for one thing or
another came to her desk. Many of these requests were for animal
experimentation. A laboratory named for an eminent scientist wanted
to find out how severely an animal could be burned and still live.
To show how economical they were the laboratory reported a horse
that had been burned over and over again. It was now in such a con~
dition as to be no longer useful in experiments.

And was this horse given curative treatment and care? see it
turned out to pasture and good food as a reward for its sacrifice
to its country? Or was it painlessly put to asses? Not at all. The
laboratory wanted Washington to know how carefully they protected
funds granted them. The horse had been sold to a peddler for $25.00!

That was twenty five years ago. Scientists, dermatologists,
researchers and even students are still burning animals in quantities.
They are becomning more callous year by year. Brutality breeds bru»
tality. If only these experimenters could feel equal pain they in~
flict upon their victims, all needless experimentation would stop
with a bang.

I quote from a statement made by a Patrolman in aichigan who
was no stranger to violence and cruelty. The following experience,
however, was too such for his and his fellow Patrolman.

"At about 9.30 P.%. July 9, 1954 we received a radio run to

 




i3-

aemorial hospital. Upon arriving the head nurse at the information

desk stated a dog in Wayne University Laboratory had beentmoaning
and crying for three hours. It was disturbing the patients. The
night watchman at the Lab took us to the basement where we found
two dogs in steel cribs. One loosed dead but the other was crying
as if in great pain. Blood and foreign matter was pouring out of
its mouth. Some of the blood had dried indicating the dog was left
to suffer for some time. The dog seemed paralysed. its tongue was
gagging it so it could not get sufficient air.

”I asked the night watchman what doctor was in attendance when
gags were in a post operative state. He said that no one watched
them. Everyone had gone home. And anyway, he said, they were only
interested in how long it takes for the animal to die.

“In subsequent interviews the acting Chief of hurgery and the
doctor who had decided the dog did not need medication took the
position that two ”irregularities" had occurred. (1) the dog should
have been debarhed. (2) the dog should not have been left in a room
with an open window."

The Patrolman's comment was: "If this (cruelty) is called for.
in the name of Science, God help us all."

State

his outraged cries also aroused the/Health Commissioner into
action. The incident was given wide coverage by the press.

What desperately needs changing is the minds of the callous men
who think it is all right to subject an animal to cruel and needless
suffering. To think it is all right to let an animal languish in pain
without care or sedative or a comfortable place to rest. Often they
are without food or water from sheer neglect. And to let this go on
for hours and days until it dies.

Gertainly this treatment does nothing to advance science.

tion at the ties Governor Dewey passed the law compelling humane

unless in a major way. Or do these experieentore, like the Nazi
torturers, "like their work"?
Here is another experiment you might imagine yourself a victim of.

Monkeys are used in this.

Suppose that electrodes had been deeply implanted in a part of

the brain called the thalamus so the experimenter could, at will,
inflict the most intense pain. You are placed in a vice similar to
the stocks used in centuries past. You are told to press a lever to
avoid the pain shocks. sow you may not have understood the instruct»
ions and therefore the pain shocks increase in intensity. You have
only 15 seconds to learn what to do as the shocks build up to an
unbearable level of pain. Because you are frightened and suffering
and uncertain what you should do the shocks build up to a "crescendo"
of shocks to "getthrough to its peak". You are in such a state of
pain and panic that you can't possibly turn the current off. An
expert on the subject of building up a "crescendo" of pain has vividly
described this in nan and gglnnin.

I wonder how many monkeys were tortured in this way before they
found one with the intelligence to do what was required of it?

Animal experimentation has become Big Business. it has grown
so rapidly that laboratories rely on poorly trained personnel and
some not trained at all. They know nothing about oareng for animals
much less experimenting on them. And far too sen care nothing whatever
about animals. Even children are encouraged to operate on vertebrate
animggg?o§:.anestheticis used. And even in the class room animals
are not destroyed after the operation. Eany doctors agree that this
is useless toscience. Only federal legislation can possibly deal
fairly and effectively with the situation that exists today.

In defense of their position, congressmen can be taken by those

who Oppose any legislation to mental hospitals and shown people of

But it is emphatically en lndltﬁment against the inn menlty of men.
It cencerne their care.

What happens to these animals after their trial by fire, knife

their sacrifice for the benefit of men? Or are they put painlessly

to which these animals are subjected, and the eteooioue conditions

Two young friends of mine had gone to a noted laboratory at the
invitation of a tooholtion who is no longer there. A pregnant dog
had been bought for eight dollars from the ownor who didn‘t want to
bother with the pupa when they came. The loboratore woo very pleased
that not only would they get a healthy female ﬂog but her pupa as
well. Iou would think than, that the dog woulo be well cared gor.
ohe waon't. ﬂy friends found her in the dog room in a cage oo omall
she couldn’t stretch out. Two of her pupa hao been smothered because
of lack of room. Tho oagoo wore all filthy. The room had no window.

Although too building was air oomﬂltioood no ventilation was given

This was reluctantly done. In tho osantlmo the vet's bill alone had

The tsoonitloo told mo tho cars of the animals was shout what
you would find in most hospitals. Sho had probably become hardened to
the situation. one said it was impossible to exorcise the dogs - any
of the animals. There wasn't room. But what did mesa changlno she
said was tho attitude of some doctors who had no compassion for the
animals.

But why shouldn't room be made for comfortable maintenance of
tosso animals that are being sacrificed for mankind? The hue and cry

is always look of funds. That particular hospital had the year before

been given a vast sum some of which wont toward tho cars of the

animals. In snotoor hospital 26 million dollars had been granted

when it was at Grand oontral Station. It was an open platform. It was
poot midnig1t and bitter cold. The temperature was three or four above
ooro. Oh thio Open platform wore oagoo of caharioo, parakooto and
monkoyo. Tho front of the cages were of wire. The birds woro crowded
and $0 woro the monkeys. They could hardly move. They came from a far
country and must havo been so con load for many oayo. In a wooded
crate woro two animals about the size of ponies. The female being
gmallor could otrotoh her nook and 118 down. The male could not. The
orato pressed agoihot hia toil and he had to hold his head a certain
way to avoid having his nose bruised. They came from Africa.

I aohod tho oxproooman how long they had been oxposod to that
hittor cold. Ho said all day, woulo be thero all night and whothor
they would be dolivorod the following day he didn‘t know. hora thoy

animals wore for tho moo, tho birds for-yet shops aha tho monkeys
wore for exporioontal laboratories.

Eear Wiss'ﬁinchel,

Recalling yeur good work in having editorial comment in
support of legislation to pratect laboratory animals published in
the Texarkana Gazette, l'm enclosing some editorials on the sub»
ject that, perhaps, you might decide to reprint.

we wish we had more correspondents in Arkansas, partiw
enlarly in View of the fact that Congressman Oren Earris, the
powerful Chairman of the Rouse Committee an Interstate and Foreign
Commerce befere whom the laboratory animala bills are pending, is
frvm Arkansas.

If yen have 33y suggestions on how we might reach Ark-
aesas humaaitarians we would be deeply grateful. Or if yau couhd
appeal directly through the pages of the Taxarkana Gazette, that
would be wanderful.

Year humane interest is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Secretary

Dear M . Ethridge,

It was very kind of you to print the coredction cancerning
the Animal Welfare Institute as you did on October Elat, and I
have intenﬁed to write t0 thank .ou long before this. Thanks,
too, for sending the report on tge pound. Some pounds are very
hard on the animals, an& it is good to km W that the Jackson pound
is humanely operated.

Because of your interest in the humane treatment of animals,
I am enclosing some information on pending legislation to require
such treatmamt in laboratories. If after looking this over, you
have questions or would.like more background material, I hepe you
will let us know. I hcpe you'll deciﬁe to help the animals, many
of whom are so much in need, by writing on thiS subject.

With kind regards,

Sincerely,

Mrs. Frank Allen'west

‘washington 7, D. C.

DeariMrs.'west:

iMr.'McKelway has referred to me your letter of February ll
about our story on the Cooper bill. I am quite familiar with the
content of this bill, having discussed it recently with Mrs. Roger
Stevens, who of course is one of the principal backers. I agree
entirely that our reference to this legislation as involving anti-
vivisection is quite incorrect and most embarrassing in View of
our editorial support of the measure.

'we are going to run your "Letter to the Editor" on the
subject within the next few days, and I hope that this will serve
to correct any'misapprehension to which we may have contributed.

. You may be interested to know that we ran another story on
February 2 on this bill, in which the facts were, I believe,
accurately stated. I enclose a photostat of that story.

Thank you for calling this error to our attention.

Faithfully yours,

My dear Mrs. Stevens:

SATURDAY REVIEW'S June 1 issue carries the story of
experiments on animals. Is there some way I can help?

I recall my arguments presented to persons, who say
- if they don't experiment on animals, how can they
help humans? I know the need here is humane ending of

I cannot hear to read the literature on this problem,
but if there is something I can do, I wish to.

I am a writer. You may have seen my story THE CAT WHO
COULDN‘T EAT RICE in January issue of Whman's Day.”
This has also been taken by the N.Y. Association for

the Blind, to go into Braille; by an Australian
magazine; and is now under consideration for a movie
or television short subject.

Yours very truly,

Miss Madeleine Bemelmans, President

745 Fifth Ave.

New York 22, N. Y.

Dear Miss Bemelmans:

Enclosed is an article which I wrote and which
appeared several days ago in this newspaper. It has
caused ouite a bit of comment, and I gather many are
writing our congressman and senators.

We are a small geOgraphical area, of course, and
not too densely pepulated, but perhaps we will leave
our mark. I hope something can be done for these
hapless animals. Do keep me informed of progress.

Perhaps you will be able to place an article in
one of the national magazines, or get an AP wire
story for broader circulation.

Sincerely Yours, ,

Dear Mr; White ,

What wanderful naws that you ara gaing t0 write anather

tha laboratory animals so greatly in naeﬁ Gf help. we are vary
glad t0 hear that you hava $80®iV€ﬂ much mail a& a result of
the column, and I am wanderimg if th&re weulﬁ be any‘way
whereby I might be able to get the adﬂregses of interegted
peaple 3G that they can b& kept informed of tha pragress of
the bill and ta whom they shmnld write at ﬁny giV$h tima to
help abtain action. Such infarmatian 13 sent Qut'witheut
charge by the Seciety for Animal Pyatectiva Lagislatiom with
which I work. Thennames of gead lettar-writers are most
valuable to this effort because vclume 9f mail is so vital
in bringing the needed urgency to the busy Congress.

I knnw haw busy yau.are, and the abeve may nﬁt be passible,
but E thcught I would mention it simce you are as strang and
fine a Supporter Of this desperately ngedeﬁ legislation.

We are looking forward with graat anticipaticn to raading
your next column. Many, many thanks for ﬁhig invaluable halp

Here is a young man who was
born in an obscure village, the
child of a peasant woman.

He grew up in another village.
He worked in a carpenter shop
until he was thirty, and then for
three years he was an itinerant
preacher.

He never wrote a book. He
never held an office. He never
owned a home. He never had a
family. He never went to a col-=-
iege. He never put his foot in~=
side a big city. He never travel:=
ed two hundred miles from the
piece where he was born. He
never did one of the things that
usuaiiy accompany greatness.

THE C HALLENGE

(By Ella Wheeler Wilcox)

To sin by silence when men
ought to protest
Makes cowards out of men.

The human race has climbed
on protest.

Had no voice been raised
against ignorance , injustice
and lust,

The inquisition still would
serve as law,

And guillotine-s decide our
least disputes .

The few who dare must
speak, and speak again
To right the wrongs of many.

By MAXWELL RIDDLE

A juvenile gang, charged with stealing dogs and forc-
ing them to fight, will appear in Juvenile Court Oct. 2.
Four members of the gang are 14, and the other is 15.

Yet they are so wild that Animal Protective League
officials had to ask for police protection the third time
gts men went to investigate The bovs threw a roller
“ ‘ate through the windshield of an APL truck and hurled

ks an another truck

he boys were finally rounded up but only after they
.f'id stolen Detective David Higgins’ Doberman Pinscher

the third time

Higgins is a Doberman Pin-

};{j' her breeder. who shares the
' eration with Eugene Gross,
. oprietor of the Advance
" on & Metal Co, at 7007
‘uincy Ave.

Recently they moved their

scrap metal yard. Their full-
grown male, Lance, disap-
peared- The dog somewhat
scarred, was returned to them
by boys who collected a re-
ward.

Dog Believed Killed

The second time, the dog,
even more battle scarred,
" managed to get home by him-
self. Meanwhile, an. 11-month-
old Doberman Pinscher, dis-
appeared for good.

It is presumed that he was
killed in a fight.

Procedure of the boys was
to tie the stolen dogs in base-
ments and starve them. After
torture and teasing, the dogs
were set upon each other.

Higgins enlisted the aid of
Ebeat patrolmen and members
of the juvenile squad.

They located Lance in a
Quincy Ave. basement, Aug.
26. Veterinarians said the
dog had been clubbed and
that he had severe injuries
rom a fight.

He also had a broken leg,
aid to have been incurred

 

when he tried to escape and
was hit. by a car.

In the meantime. the gang
had broken into the scrap
metal company and had stolen
tour puppies not yet weaned.
One of these was recovered,
but is reported dying at a

' veterinary hospital.

Red Stewart. a deputy dog
warden at the Animal Pro--
tective League, said he had
been trying to capture the
gang for more than a year.

“Those kids wore bandan-
has and would parade around
the streets acting tough;

Gang Would Scatter
“Every time they’d have a
dog fight going. we’d get a
call. But the people out, there
would clam. up and the gang
would scatter.

“The second time they dam-
aged our truck, we asked for
police protection. Then we
went back there again but
the police never showed up”
Steward said.

Higgins personally filed 3f:
fidavits against the gang."
They are charged with break~
ing and entering, and the
stealing of five dogs of great,
but. undetermined value.

“I'm not stopping here.”
Higgins said. “We want to
know how many other dogs
that gang stole. and what be
came of t11e1n."_

‘ "AW/Zoman’s New York: Alice Hughes

 

 

Easter Bunny for Y Oungster
Should Be Toy or Candy

For this Easter the American
Society for the Prevention of
,Cruelty ‘to Animals has a plan
with which I heartily concur. If
any readers have the intention of

placing a baby chick or a duck—‘

ling into the hands of a child—to
maul and tease—and probably
dispose of unmercifully when

grown tired of playing with the.

living toy—abandon that intention,
please.

It is not in the spirit of Easter
—or of any other day—to give over
a living. breathing creature to a
youngster who, unknowingly be-
comes a torturer. New York and
some other states have a law
which says no one may sell or
give away more than “six living
baby chicks, ducklings or other
fowl under two months of age.”
Why permit even six? However,
there are unscrupulous dealers
who disregard this law, despite
the efforts of the ASPCA who urge
conviction of violators.

There is considerable agitation
going on among people who have
a tender. heart toward animals,-
birds and such. They are trying

- to bring about legislation against,

the loose, too-free-and-easy way,
of making dogs, cats, rabbits and

other living creatures unnece's-l-~

sary guinea pigs for medical

experiments.
When human life and medical
discoveries are well served by

these experiments, there is no j

complaint. But whenit is possible
to proceed without inflicting paint
to the animal, it is urged that a
precaution and prevention be ta- '
ken. Moreover there are com-
plaints that once these tests are
made, the animals are sometimes '
carelessly handled, improperly
looked after and allowed to suf

fer. »

Indifference to suffering is an,
intolerable trait in any one.
Therefore the plight of animals
kept in cages after being operated
upon and submitted to trying

{beginning to try their wobbly legs.
Ten kids have just been born '
to the Toggenburg and hybrid
goats, and the young ones are
already climbing on the artificial
cordwood mountain built for
them. “Midnight Glory," a reg-
istered saddle horse, is expected
to produce a foal any minute.
There’s a big Belgian mare

named Nellie, and a donkey named

Julie. Chickens, ducks, geese
and Yorkshire hogs crowd the
barnyard and make a loud, un-

, musical cacophony.

One of the, sights young chil-
dren adore is to watch eggs hatch.
The Bronx Zoo invites children
to see this weekly event each
Saturday and Sunday, which are
the youngsters’ big visiting days.

tests, should include as much as/ Another weekly spectacle is

possible of the tender loving care

. that human beings in pain require.

As to the Easter plan, instead?
of involving a young chick, why
not take the child to a zoo? Be-
fore me are the social notes
among the animals in the Bronx
Zoo. Just in time for Easter the
ﬂock of Dorset and Karakul sheep
have produced six lambs, still‘
clinging to their mothers, but

the Sunday shearing of sheep.
These are only a few ofthe sights
children can see at the zoo,which
reveal how kindness can be ex-
tended to the lowliest creature,
and which implant the seed of
kindness within the young view-
ers’ hearts and minds in an un-
forgettable way. Please don’t give
a tot a tiny chicken for Easter.
Take the tot to the zoo instead.

Dear Mrs. Estill:
Thank you for your letter.

We have considered, and are considering, a story
on the inhumane treatment of laboratory animals, but it
is difficult to do effectively. It cannot be done at all unless
we can actually see the animals, and those who keep them,
and mistreat them, are reluctant to allow any pictures to
be mad-e, since it is obvious to them what our purpose
would be. That has been and still is the obstacle. But we
have not given up, and some time I hope we are able to do
it.

Again, thank you, and my best wishes to you.

  

Sincerely, .

430 Prospect Avenue,
Mount Vernon, New York
May 11: 1963

Mrs. Christine Stevens,

Society for Animal Protective Legislation,
745 Fifth Avenue,

New York, N.Y.

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Your letter was most welcome, and I appreciate the
valuable time you took to reply to mine, and to check my article;
for flaws.

I'm studying with the Famous Writers School in Westport.
Our instructors do not help find markets, but they give us the
information needed on how to look for them, ourselves, which in
the long run is probably the best for us. At this stage, I'm not
too sure what market would be interested in this type of article,
but if you feel it's worth it, I'll gladly look around and
sound out a few. Perhaps you know of some publications that
handle this kind of summary of humane work - let me know if you
do. While we're encouraged to wait until the Course is completed
before writing for publication, still if we happen to have anything
that might sell, they're glad to have us try it out.

I'm sorry I'm.in.no position to help monetarily with
your work, but perhaps I can help in this other way, instead.

In my assignment, the length was limited, and I'd:
probably have to embellish it for a magazine. But since it was
written as a news story in which I couldn't editorialize, I imagine
I'd best keep it that way.

I can just omit the words "high school" on Page 4, and
perhaps instead I'll include some of your description of the series
of eight major operations.

There are also a.few more things I'd like to be sure of,
before rewriting it. For instance, I've quoted from your own publicity
several times, but I'm not sure where you got the information, or 2
whether I can use it without credit. On Page 2, e.g., I quote what
"they" (the Society) wrote. Again, on Page 3, what they reported.
Later there's the description of the plight of the wild horses, and
the hobbling of their noses. While I quote it directly, I don't
acknowledge its source (in fact, I don't know the source! )

 




Finally at the end I say merely that "one surgeon"
reported at the hearings, (etc.) Would I be able to use that
direct quotation, without identiﬂying him, or getting his
permission? I know I can use a certain number of words without
trouble, but I wouldn't want to do the wrong thing. You've had
so much more experience here that I'd prefer checking with you
first when I'm uncertain.

By the way, since some magazines doubtless want
articles on items currently in the news, do you.know approxe
imately when any more action on humane legislature is going
to be in the limelight?

I'll go ahead with a rewrite as soon as you set me
straight on the above matters. If I make any serious changes
in my original manuscript, I'll tell you.first.

Incidentally, I don't know whether I've ever really
introduced myself to you, but for the record, I'm in the toy
business - a.young handicapped woman and I have our own shop,
and design and manufacture stuffed toys. This means that our
time is sometimes very full, during rush seasons. At present
we're in a slack period, which allows me time to write. By the
end of summer, we won't have time for anything but toys.

Therefore, we take our vacation in June. I'm going to
try to contact some magazines before I leave, but I thought you.
should know what the set~up is, in case things are held up while
we do new samples, or something.

Thank you.again for all your trouble. I hope some
publicity will efentually come from it, in your behalf.

Cordially,

Lida.Nesberry

Mrs. Christine Stevens,

% Society for Animal Protective Legislation,
745 Fifth Avenue, _

NeW'York 22, N.Y.

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Do you remember answering a long list of questions
for me about your Society, a few weeks ago? I was using it for a.news
story in a writing school assignment, and you said you'd like to
see the result.

I'm enclosing it here. I should explain that the
lesson was for straight news with no editorializing, which accounts
for the lack of personal opinions. My instructor said it "is a real
shocker and should appeal to every animal lover, which includes
most of us."

If you do have time to check it over, I'd appreciate
knowing if I misunderstood anything along the line. Had I been
writing it for publication, of course I'd have gone over it first with
you, for flaws. Since I knew how busy you.were, I decided to do as much
as I could with the material at hand. And of course it was written
to introduce people who never heard of you, to your work. Therefore
it is necessarily Sketchy in some places, and repetitions of things
youlve stressed time and again, in others.

Thank you.so much for your help. And the best of
luck to all of you in your work.

Cordially,

ozia.

In gour letter of Aoril 5 you say that you have lost

documented and subject to proof. The support of such
newepeoers as the NE? YORK TimeS,-the WASHINETDN PQST, end
many more, comes about precisely becouse of the factual nature
of the case for protective legislation. *

Mr. Henry Beetle Hough

Vineyard'Gazette

Edgartown

Martha‘s Vineyard, Massachusetts

Dear Mr. Hough

I subscribe completely to the opinions expressed in the editorial in
HOSPITALS, Journal of the American Hospital.Association, and reprinted
in TRUSTEE, Journal for Hospital Governing Boards. I, as you know,

am the editor of both publications.

I must admit surprise at the clipping from the Evening Star in washington.
I have lost touch with the law as it now exists in the District of Columbia
but I do know that there is a law permitting the use of unclaimed pets

for proper animal experimentation in Baltimore and thus it sounds strange
to me that suCh a practice as is described in this article would be sup—
ported by the medical schools in the Baltimore area, the Johns Hopkins

and the University of Maryland, both of which have proper recourse to
unclaimed pound animals.

I am not impressed by the leaflet from.the Society for.Animal Protective
Legislation. I have read similar leaflets throughout more than thirty
years of exposure to the testimonials of the anti—vivisectionists, as an
active newspaperman, as a worker in a hospital, and later as a member of
the staff of the.American Hospital Association.

I am not convinced that the easy indictment of responsible scientists
can be supported or ever has been supported by the difficult hard facts.

I think that the current legislation, despite the fact that it sounds so
reasonable, would deter the advances of medicine which have been of such
great help to you and to me and to the patients in the hospital which
you serve. '

Sincerely yours

Dear Mrs. Stevens,

How very kind of you to write such
a generous and appreciative letter about
the animals story. I hope the publicity
helps relieve the unhappy plight of
homeless cats and dogs.

If would be my pleasure to meet
you and discuss the problem of food
chemicals. My book is being reviewed
in the Times this weekend,'and getting
the hell knocked out of it, as was to be
expected. The reviewer, who has written
many peans to the FDA, is four—square in'
favor of eating small amounts of poisons,
and thinks that anyone Who suggests that
this might be risky procedure is being
"hysterical".

However, as you may have learned from
your work with animals, the path of a
crusader is lined with insult, invective
and infamy, which is all part of the
game 0

Dear Miss Draper:

Enclosed is an article which appeared Tuesday in
this newspaper. I hepe it will do some good. At least,

a number of peOple have told me they are writing our
congressman and our senators.

You may remember I wrote you in January for
material for a feature article. What with the pressure
of other work, I did not write it as soon as I had
intended. I've written features for more than 22 years.
This was the most difficult I ever have done. It was
almost more than I could do to write some of the
examples of cruelty.

Hown about a story on the Animal Welfare Institute,
while peOple are so interested here? Do you have
historical date on the institute, and instances of some
of your successes as well as failures?

Thank you so much for your help.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Miss Hunter:

Thank you for your note. We have considered, and
are considering, a story on. the inhumane treatment of
laboratory animals, but it is difficult to do effectively. It
cannot be done at all unless we can actually see the animals,
and those who keep them, and mistreat them, are reluctant
to allow any pictures to be made, since it is obvious to them
what our purpose would be. That has been and still is the
obstacle. But we haVe not given up, and some time I hope
we are able to do it.

Again thank you, and my best wishes to you.
Sincerely,

Dear Miss Stevens:

Thank you for thoughtfully sending me the
material on humane problems.

Due to the newspaper strike here and other
assignments, I have not been able to get any time
to look into this problem. Unfortunately, I also
doubt whether I will have time to follow humane
legislation in the coming State Legislative session.
We have a schedule that is heavier than ever this
year. But I will do my best if there is any possi—
bility of coverage at all.

Thank you once again for your interest and
help.

A 5A Christmas Pitch féﬁ the Animal IS“ [1 f .

’, .' , ANNUAL SEASON is at hand when the rat-
tling of the cup of charity on a national scale is
. heard in the land and appeals for benevolence at the
* international level threaten to drown out the emetic
,- strains of “White Christmas” on the radio and loud-

?speakers which .mistaken municipalities permit to

, harass otherwise cheerful shoppers.

, ' At every level the bewildered citizen

’ is assaulted for the support of somebody
else, ranging from. agencies for the sup—

, pression of Parkinson’s disease to re-
} " Search foundations devoted to the rout-a
. .ing of paresis and thrush. Caught off
(balance by fountains of sentimentality,

.3; '

" 5? . the man of good will is looted and pil»

laged in the name of Community Chests,
a the Salvation Army and assorted institu-

. tional organizations of fair repute and good name and
others that wouldn’t bear looking into.

Santa Claus is in everybody’s pocket in the name
‘ of orphans in Mesopotamia and unwed mothers in
. the Congo. Charity and chaos are inseparable. -
Now every blessed or damned one of these
pitches for your money in the name of charity and
good Works is devised to ameliorate the sufferings,
. many of them self-induced, some of them imaginary,
- and all of them vocal, of members of the alleged

human race, an evil, predatory, remorseless and unn
justifiable breed of placental mammals Without
’ » earthly excuse for being or cosmic importance.

Most of the misery you are asked to help elim=~
inate is rooted in human cruelty, stupidity, rapacity

' , and complete moral irresponsibility. There may be

doubt in the minds of cynical men and women if
‘ . the race is worth the sympathy and trouble that is
lavished on it by soft-hearted officiousness.

a a a

p I..- THERE ARE, HOWEVER, beings who are every

bit as much, entitled to life, its comforts, neces-n
sities and considerations as you and I and perhaps
, ' more so and they are, almost without exception, vice-
- tims of the thoughtlessness, cruelty, greed and su-
perior arrogance of the only slightly superior race
of, apes that masquerade as homo sapiens.

, Not one of these sentient and often altogether
admirable beings will ask you for a thin dime this

Christmas or, for that matter, thank you vocally, .

if you give it to them, yet there is more merit, it
seems to me and more chance for heavenly regard
if such exists-in doing something in the way of kind
‘ness to an animal than in all the appeals of widows

and orphans, the maimed and disinherited who are '

able to whimper for charity either at first hand or
* through the Organized vicars of benevolence.

There are no: department store Santa ClauSes

1-1011 the street corners ringing bells for homeless dogs

and starving kittens and poisoned birds. Happily, the

mechanical age, in its one truly justifiable aspect, has. ,
largely removed horses from availability to human!

neglect and viciousness so that what horses remain
at all exist in upholstered comfort. » ' '

But there are in countless multiplicity and in
every community in the land abandoned pets,
starving strays of fur and misery, ani-

mals mutilated on the highway or

‘ tortured by children who are available

to the several agencies for animal wel-

fare whose names are known everywhere ' '

and whose reputations are beyond re-
proach.

I would like to suggest some. of the
_ enormous ﬂow of money, much of itill-
considered and some of it donated to
outright swindles, that will derive from
people of good will this Christmas be diverted to the
benefit of living creatures all of them as deserving
of life and food and warmth and kindness as the most
pathetic human underdog for whose relief your gen-
erosity is being solicited. .
Nine times out of ten he is an underdog through
his ownfault. N 0 animal ever is.
? ’* air it: ,
NOTION THAT the human race is of any im-
portance is rooted solely in human thinking and .
nowhere else. There is no available evidence that it. ‘
enjoys heavenly regard or cosmic esteem and the ‘
prospect that it may, at any moment, cut its own idiot '
throat from ear to ear is, to some thoughtful folk,
only hilarious. ' ~ '
A little humility might be in order before uni-
versal dissolution sets in and a little humility would
immeasurably elevate the estate of animals in all

— rational human intelligence. It might even mitigate

the measureless disdain with which people must be
regarded by the cosmic being if there is one. ' '

As I have said, no animal misery is vocal. N0
appeals will be directed at your potential susceptibil-
ity through the resources of Madison Avenue’s exe
pertise in evoking ' sentimentality and self-identifica-
tion with human misfortune, usually at sufficient
remove to obviate first hand enquiry and often so '
far removed that most of your money is absorbed

' by campaigns. to solicit it. The Animal Rescue

Leagues, Humane Societies, Animal Shelters and The
Society for The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals

, haven’t the resources to mount campaigns of pity in

the coated paper press'where insertion rates top $5000
a page. '

The animals have no Community Chest. ,

So I would like to suggest that, in a season of

_ universal solicitation, you divert a little of your.

bounty and your professionally exploited" good will
from those who may indeed need it the least and are
most clamorous in their demands to the friendly

animals who need it most desperately. and will; not

- ask for it at all. They will not embarrass you. with

r saying thank you, which will be a matter for your ,
secret heart. ‘ " , .’ , '

Dear Mrs. Stevens,

We have a legislative project of our own
going in Indiana. I thought you might be interested
since you seem to have a feeling for all
defenseless creatures.

Frank White, a loyal supporter of the AWI
and a Hoosier newspaper columnist, is heading
the fight to defeat the bill which would permit
an cpen season on doves.

This article and letter in are for your
information. You need not answer. (But please
do not misunderstand -- it is always pleasant
and encouraging to receive one of your letters.)

Dear Mrs. Stevens,

Thank you for sending me a copy of the hearings
on 1937. I has already obtained a cOpy through
our congressman, Ralph Harvey, so wouio you rather
I return yours?

Ensiosed is a story I wrote from the testimony.
There are others to be written but I started With
the moral and religious angie firstly because I
had not used it before and secondly because it is
an important angie in a smali town and rural areas.

Now, about the next session of Congress. As
-an old campaigner, wouid you teii me how to proceed?
Does one start writing letters and signing petitions
immediateiy? And I suppose you ask for a hearing
first?

I love your responsiveness. It does a lot
toward inspiring my vision and boistering my
courage.

Here is a rather feeble effort but I will have another
cut at it when Congress reconvenes.

Our own Congressman, Mr. Poage, has been overseas practically

the entire time since Congress adjourned. When I can catch

bill.

Good luck and God bless you.

Dear Mrs. Boland,

I'm sorry to have lost my copy on that story I did
concerning experimental animals. As I'm sure you can ima—
gine, I write this stuff almost by the pound, and unless I
stay up all night, it doesn't get properly filed.

It's bound to appear sometime, however, and when it
does I'll shoot it along.

Eery nice to have such a close ear tuned to us.

Season's best.

Siaferely,

Cats9 Generosity to Others
Goes Unsung by the Ignorant

NEW Y( 1K.

I SUPPOSE theie must be a
few decent citizens alive who
don"t like cats. It’s just my
luck that I have never met one.

In fact, hard as I fight against

developing prejudice against oth-
er men and women just because
they differ from me, I cannot rid
myself of a feeling of uneasiness
‘ in the presence of cat haters.
It’s not that I think they’re dis-
honest or given to taking ad-
Vantage of the poor. It’s just
that I consider them all sadisic,
bloodthirsty, mean-tempered, ill-
mannered, egotistical, neurotic,
and hard of heart. Some of
them, I understand, even manu-
facture patent medicine.

NOT LONG AGO I read a
piece in a magazine in which
a man bragged of his hobby of
killing cats -— touring the coun-
tryside with a gang of equally

ill-favored companions and gun- "

ning doWn all the “wild” pussy-
cats they managed to corxner

He lationalized his deeds, which .

he will one day pay for in purga-
tory, by explaining in the
meaching manner common to
cat-haters, that he was bent on
saving the game and the son-g-
birds that the kitties destroy.
And he repeated, of course, the
standard lie of his ilk: that
“experts” (always nameless)
figured each cat killed at least
a hundred songbirds a year.
Now I have owned the ac-

MM

quaintance of seve1a1 hundred
fine cats in my lifetime, cats
of every breed and station in
life — pure-bred Siamese, ring-
tailed alley - cats, semi-long—
haired lovelies from Maine, gray
cats, red cats, and calicoes. In-
deed the only homes I ever knew
that were fit to live in had cats
in them. Ideally they had dogs
too and if they were completely
civilized they had a nice pig out
back and a horse in the ham
From the time I was two I have
spent long hours in the company
of cats and I never knew one
that managed to nail a bird
more often than four or five
times in the summer and in the
-winter practically not at all.
:3: :{z >1:

IT MAY BE that the louse-
ridden starlings and sprung-
tailed bluejays that my feline
friends bring home from time
to time rate as song birds. llut
I take note too that the kiies
make our lives hideous
stronger than the cat’s right to
jazz. up his diet now and then.
I take note too that. the kitties

always took their bag home to
share with the family — offering
it first to me and then to what-

ever old Tom happened to be in .

residence and finally to the kit-
tens. That’s the nature of a
cat —— to love his home and p10—
vide £01 it, just as it is a dog 5
nature to guard it from strang~
ers. .

,The little cat I loved the most

any ,

Robert rSmith /%.Axe/ ”4-44

—-—a sleek little tiger from the
state of Maine who always
thought of herself as human and
used to use the facilities in the
ladies’ room and even contem-
plate sometimes getting into the
tub with me to get soaped up —
that little cat would every now
and then drag home a cotton-
tail rabbit, tugging it along'with '
her legs a-spraddle, to lay it at
my feet and beg me, with a little
purring meow, to partake of it.
But, hell, she never did away
with as many 1abbits as half
‘ a dozen men I know and she
only caught two birds in all her
life. What prizes she did cap-
ture she always shared, some-
times getting noneherself. She
caught mice by the bushel and
would not think of biting into
one until she had offered me
I11 st taste.
NOW I HAVE a snow-white
lady cat with the half-longhair '
g of the Maine breed, and her
family besides us consists of the
papa cat (a gentle Siamese) and
a red tiger baby - all that is
left of her last litter. She pro-
vides for them, as a sort of
vitamin supplement, a constant
supply 0f small g1ay mice and
long-tailed rats, the rats being
bigger than the kitten I never
have worked up a 1eal rage
' ag unst mice myself but I can-
not figuie that the weild is
wmse off because my kitties
dispose of a, few of them. I am
sure more little lambs are killed

 

»., on our account than mice on

hers. .

Cat haters, of course, out of
their measuieless ignorance,
will always describe cats as
treacherous and quick to claw
anyone who tries to pet them.
But there is no animal alive

. any gentler or more devoted

3 than a well brought up eat. It
is true that cats will not stand
for constant be-deviling and will
sometimes resist torture and re-

3 fuse to “do tricks.” But I can -
catch my cat by the tail if need
be to keep him from getting
caught in a closing door and
he will not even .make .a pre-
tense of biting me. I have put
pills down my kitties’ throats
and h av e held them and

. swabbed thei1 painful cuts and
never got a clawmark. And I’ I
come home often to the scene;
of the mama eat, all self-washed
and slumbering, stretchedfou‘t on" ‘ '
the third step, while the big
Tom cat, two steps below, [is :
tenderly washing the baby’s
ears. Even if you saw people
in that pose you would haVe. .
to count them a pretty decent
sort

Dear Miss Stevens:

I am enclosing tear sheets of this week's editorial

I have received the copy of the Congressional hearing

In the meantime, I would very much appreciate any material you

can supply me with on the humane slaughter legislation.

Very truly yo

Dear Miss (Mrs?) Roland,

Thank you for your approval of my animal
legislation piece. I feel very strongly that there
is an obligation by science to be utterly scrupu-
lous in the handling of animals in research, and I
fear that often investigators may become_callous
and insensitive.

I have no patience, however, with those
who say we must rule out any advance in medicine
if it involves testing on animals.

Surely there is a middle ground here, and
both sides are obliged to find it.

Here is an editorial I wrote on

I hope it gets through this time.
Let us know if there is anything we might
do to be helpful.

Please give my best regards to Mr.

Every bit of good publicity helps the humanitarian
cause. The enclosed column is a popular one in Indiana, used
by 40 or 50 newspapers. Several months ago I provided Mr.
White with information, and he promised me he would make ao~
caeional use of it. This is the fourth time he has devoted his

column to aninal welfare, and I hope to have him use it when

the legislature meets in January to further the humane slaughter

campaign.
