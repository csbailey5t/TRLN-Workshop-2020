SUNDAY IN THE ARMY AND NAVXD
A Message from President Lincoln

Executive Mansion, Washington, Nov. 15,
1862.

The President, Commander-in-Chief of the
Army and Navy, desires and enjoins the or-
derly observance of the Sabbath by the ofﬁcers
and men in the military and naval service.
The importance for man and beast of the pre-
scribed weekly rest, the sacred rights of Christian
soldiers and sailors, a becoming deference to
the best sentiment of a Christian people, and a
due regard for the Divine Will, demand that
Sunday labor in the army and navy be reduced
to the measure of strict necessity. The disci-
pline and character of the National forces
should not suffer, nor the cause they defend be
imperiled, by the profanation of the day or
name of the Most High. “At this time of public
distress,” adopting the words of Washington in
1776, “Men may ﬁnd enough to do in the ser-
vice of God and their country, without aban-
doning themselves to vice and immorality.”
The ﬁrst general order issued by the Father of
his Country, after the Declaration of Independ-
ence, indicates the spirit in which our institu-
tions were founded a n d should ever be
defended:—“ The General hopes and trusts that
every oﬂicer and man will endeavor to live and act
as becomes a Christian soldier, defending the
dearest rights and liberties of his country.”

ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
