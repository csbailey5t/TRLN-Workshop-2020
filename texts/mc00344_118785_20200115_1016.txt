Dear Mrs. Bemelmans:

i am aware of the shocking abuses to animals used in
laboratory research which have been exposed in magazine articles
by the Humans Society, and other interested persons and organiza-
tions. During the last Congress, the Interstate and.Foreign Com-
merce Committee held hearings on.proposals to provide for humane
treatment Of animals used in exteriments and tests by recipients
of grants from the Federal Government. I have been advised by

,;§ the Committee that it is possible further hearings will be
i 9 scheduled this year. I want to assure you I have a sympathetic
7 interest in this matter.

Yours sincerely,

My dear Mrs. Stevens:

Thanks very much for your letter of June 15 and the
enclosed editorial reprints from the brochure. Grim hardly
describes the latter -- it should make us the more determined
to pursue our goal until it's achieved.

I'm sure Congressman Roberts was in good faith when
he promised hearings several months ago but I'm afraid subsequent
events make it unlikely that we will get actian during the present

Congress. With the Civil Rights bill out of the way the House
and Senate will begin action on appropriation bills and other
priority business that has been building up for nearly three
months. It's doubtful that we'll be able to wind up by the time
of the Republican convention and I‘m afraid this means that

the circumstances won’t be right for bringing new legislation

to the Floor ~— even if we could get it out of Committee.

In any event, I hope you will stop by the office when
you're next in Washington because I'd like to have your thinking
on these and other matters.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

Ll

laboratory research whicn have been exposed in magazine articles
‘by tne Humane Society, and other interested persons and organiza-

treatment of animals used in experiments and tests by recipients
of grants from the Federal Government. I have been advised the
Committee hopes to schedule further hearings next year, and can
assure you that I have a sympathetic intrerst in the matter.

Dear Mrs . Bemelmans :

Thank you for your letter of January 23, 1963 in
which you expressed your gratitude to the Comittee for
scheduling hearings in the last Congress on bills to re-
quire humane treatment of laboratory animals.

As you know, time did not permit any further
consideration of these preposals beyond the hearings and ,
as a new Congress has commenced, it will be necessary for
the bills to be reintroduced before they can be acted upon
by the Committee.

Should similar legislation be introduced and re-
ferred to this Committee, the material you have submitted
with your letter will be made a part of the files of that
legislation and referred to when'the matter comes up for
consideration .

I can appreciate your great interest and concern
for legislation requiring humane treatment of laboratory
animals and I want to than}: you for taking the time to
write to me in regard to the matter.

The various hills which have been intro-

spoken with him about this and it is doubtful that
such hearings or other consideration will be

Dear Mrs. Bemelmans:

This is to let you know that I appreciated
receiving your recent letter and enclosures pertaining
to testimony on the need for legislation to provide humane
treatment for experimental animals.

It is my belief that the activities of interested
individuals, such as yourself, have done a great deal already
to correct undesirable conditions which prevailed in the past.
Responsible investigators have voluntarily instituted humane
laboratory practices. You may be sure that the proposed
legislation will be given every consideration when presented,
and it was good of you to let me know your views.

Very truly yours,

Thank you for your letter about humane treatment

As you know, it is necessary that experimentation
he done in order that we maintain and improve our high
standards of research. However, we should at all times
avoid any unnecessary suffering of research animals.

I am glad to have your Opinion. No hearings have

will certainly weigh your views carefully.

it was good of you to let me know of your support of H. R. 1937,
R. R. 3556 and S. 3083, which were before the 87th Congress. As
you know, all legislation which was not acted upon by the 87th
Congreee died with its adjournment last October, but I am con-
fident that similar legislation will be presented to the present
Congress.

As one who had administrative reeponsibility some years ago for

an extensive medical research program, I have seen firsthand some
of the practices that have prompted this legislation, and you may
be sure that I will study any proposal that comes before me with
sympathy and objectivity, always keeping in mind your clear state-
ment of Eupport.

With all best wishes, I am,

Dear Miss Bemelsmans:

Thank you for sending me the information and copies of
statements relating to the humane treatment of
experimental animals.

I have received a number of letters from constituents
and other interested people and am, therefore, aware of
the hearings from last fall.

I agree, of course, that animals used in laboratory
experiments deserve the best possible care and treatment.
I shall give a fair and open minded consideration to
legislation on this subject.

With my best wishes.

7L6 Fifth Avenue

Dear Mrs . Bemelnans:

Thank you very much for taking the time to
write me concerning the treatment of animals used in laboratory
experiments .

Since Federal funds account for such a large
share of the money spent for medical and allied research (over 50
percent) the Government has an undeniable responsibility for the
control of abuses under the research pregame . Very few States
have laws regulating aninl experimentation and in the absence of
Federal legislation the only alternatives are local control by
individual commit ies or voluntary action , and these controls are
apparently inade quote .

What is needed is legislation that will set a
middle ground between those who would have no control of animal
experimentation and those who would abolish it entirely. I
certainly would support such legislation if given the Opportunity
and can assure you that I will do aw utmost toward the passage of
a workable and effective bill during the 88th Congress.

Assuring you that I not only understand but
share your deep concern over the treatment of experimntal animls,
I am with very best wishes,

S incerely ,

Dear Miss Bemelmans:

Thank you for your recent letter, and enclosures, relative
to pending legislation to require humane treatment of eXperimental
animals (3. 533 and H.R. 5430).

3 Since I feel that animals used in research should be pro-

f tected against abuse and mistreatment, I agree with the statement

‘ of Dr. Albert Schweitzer which you quoted. I feel that although
scientific experiments on animals are important as a means to
advancement in medicine and surgery, simple decency requires that
we protect such animals from unthinking cruelty. I therefore have
a sympathetic attitude toward legislation to provide guidelines to
be followed in the laboratory in experiments involving animals.

Since this pending legislation presumably will never be
enacted unless and until it is reported to the House and to the
Senate by the two Committees having jurisdiction -~ the House Com-
mittee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce and the Senate Committee
on Labor and Public Welfare -- it seems to me that the public should
evidence its interest in this legislation by urging these Committees
to take action on bills of this nature so that they may be brought
out of committee and onto the floor for debate and action. I shall
be pleased to cooperate in any way that I can in helping to see that
this legislation receives consideration during the present Congress.

Sincerely, fﬂ”

Dear Miss Bemelmans:

Thank you very much for your letter in re-
gard to legislation requiring the humane treatment of animals
in laboratories.

I am quite familiar with the two bills that
were introduced during the last session, H. R. 3556 and H. R.
1937, that called for such action.

It is my understanding that these measures
were not reported by the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce
Committee last year but that they are considering re~introduc~
ing them this year. If they do, you may rest assured that I
will have your views in mind.

Again, thanks so much for writing.
