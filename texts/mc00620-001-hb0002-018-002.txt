Mr.
Shaw says that political science has been as
recklessly neglected during his lifetime as
sanitary science was in the days of Charles H.
Nature, he says, gave us a long credit, and we
abused it to the uttermost. But when she
struck (by means of four years of war, 1914—
1918) at last she struck with a vengeance.

wars come about, it seems to me.

\Who can say that Nature has not granted us
a long credit since 1918 in connection with the
many hideous forms of cruelty that we tolerate
in our modern civilisation ? Who can say that
in this present war we are not being presented
with a bill for our neglects and misdeeds P It
is only a ﬁgure of speech to say that Nature
demoralises us with a long credit. It is we
who are blind to the risks we run in the aiding
and abetting of suffering and cruelty, in the
condonation of crime where animals are con—
cerned, in the butchery and savagery looked at
from the animals’ point of view, in our active
and passive perpetrations of the physical and
moral equivalent of war upon animal kind, in
your apparently hidebound insensitivity where
pain to fellow creatures cries to the high
heavens, in our bland disregard of the hatred
and horror we have engendered in the hearts
and minds of multitudes of God’s creatures.

This is not to be taken to mean that cruelty
to our fellow—creatures in animal bodies is the

only cause of war. It is not. There are other

causes rising from other unheroic neglects and
near—cowardly temporisings and makeshifts.
Are we as gallant a people as we should like to
be? Is our heroism to be conﬁned to that
imposed upon us in a conﬂagration which we
lacked the courage to, foresee and forestall ?
Is there not a courage which insight gives into

the real causes and real issues of war P Do we

If so, then we must try to
think again, and try to bring in all the factors

that stand to our debit and credit in the global

accounts of Nature. If we now see that un-
healthy conditions of life tend directly to bring
about diseases and epidemics, may we not also
come to see that cruel conditions and practices
tend towards an outbreak of violence such as
war .3

The great philosopher Kant is supposed to
have said that war, and the suffering caused by
war, would bring men eventually to a stage
where reason would have brought them, if
they were inclined to listen to the dictates of
reason. Something more than'reason is re—
quired, though we must use what reasoning
powers we possess. \W e need insight and that
kind of imagination that enables us to see any

 




suffering as it affects the sufferer, be the sufferer
human or sub—human. Imagination fails and
falters if it excludes the capacity to feel some—
thing of the pains and joys of our fellow-
creatures.

Our work in the animal welfare movement
takes on a very signiﬁcant and 'important
aspect when viewed from this standpoint of
insurance against war. It may take some time
before it is recognised as such, but that does
not in the least alter the position. We must go
on trying to build up a credit balance on the
side of peace by our work. It is a long-

task, but Nature apparently works on long—

term lines in bringing about the “ catastrophic
bankruptcies ” that are mentioned by Mr.
Bernard Shaw. How important our work is
none can estimate or judge on a superﬁcial
glance. Even in religious circles the full truth
about cruelty to our fellow-creatures and its
inevitable, though long-delayed results, is not
yet appreciated. If from the standpoint of the
theory of evolution, or of the one—ness of life,
or of universal kinship, or of universal law,
we can still be complacent or indifferent to the
issues involved in the wholesale inﬂiction of
suffering and cruelty, the real core of truth
escapes us, and we may be counted among
those who have eyes, but see not I
