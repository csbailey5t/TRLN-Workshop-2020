Our Humane Education Department serves as consultant on animal problems :to
a number of organizations. The Supervisor is a member of the Committee on Animal
Care of the Board of Education of New York City, and has been named to the Advisory
Council of the Dog Care Division of Ralston Purina Co., manufacturer of dog food.

Obedience training for dogs

With the City’s licensed dog population pegged at around 260,000, obedience
training is a real necessity for all dogs. Bad-mannered dogs are a hazard in trafﬁc, an
annoyance to neighbors and a nuisance to landlords. A well-behaved pet is welcome
almost anywhere.

Since 1944 the ASPCA has trained 18,000 dogs and their owners at our obedience
training classes in Manhattan, the Bronx and Glen Cove. Dogs and owners are always
trained together ——- the theory being that we teach you to train your dog. Dogs should
be at least six months old, but there is no maximum age. All dogs must be licensed.

In the beginners class the dog learns to walk at the owner’s side, lie down, come
on call, stay, stand on command and jump over a stick. In the advanced class the dog
learns to do all this oil leash, plus carrying, retrieving and jumping over hurdles.
Speciﬁc problems are not dealt with individually, but obedience training helps give an
owner better over-all control of his dog.

The eight-week courses begin in winter, spring and fall. The fee is $18 for owner
and dog. Visitors may attend for $3 a course, single ticket $1. Children are welcome
as visitors, but they are seldom qualiﬁed to take the course, except with the instructor’s
special permission.

Where our money comes from
“

Dog license fees

The ASPCA’s total budget for the ﬁscal year 1961-1962 was $1,746,881. About
half our income —— $784,197 —— came from the $3 New York City dog license fee, which
the Society collects under a state law in return for speciﬁed services to the City of
New York.

These services include issuing dog licenses, enforcing the dog license law, main-
taining shelters for the care of lost, stray and abandoned animals and putting them to
sleep humanely. These services cost the Society $971,008 last year. So despite the law’s
intention that the license fee reimburse us for this work, it fell short by $186,811.

The Society’s other sources of income—memberships, contributions, bequests,
income from investments—are earmarked for our other services, such as humane
education, inspections, investigations of alleged cruelty, prosecutions, rescues, horse
watering, adoptions and care of charity cases in the hospital. But since 1956 these
other sources of income have been invaded to make up the deﬁcit in the dog license
operation.

Preventing cruelty
—

As our name implies, preventing cruelty is one of our most important jobs. Dur-
ing the year the Humane Work Division, which is responsible for our anti-cruelty
activities, was reorganized and enlarged to enable the Society to place more emphasis
on this vital phase of our work.

Edmond M. Rowan, a retired Army colonel who holds many decorations and
honors, was appointed director. The roster of uniformed investigators, called Special
Agents, was increased from nine to fourteen to broaden the facilities for inspections,
investigations of cruelty complaints, follow-ups and necessary enforcement actions.

Investigation of alleged cruelty

Under New York State law ASPCA agents, as peace oﬂicers, have jurisdiction in
animal cruelty matters throughout the entire state. In addition to the fourteen men
who cover New York City, we maintain a number of representatives throughout the
State.

In New York City our agents are on duty from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., including
weekends. Normally, a complaint received one day is investigated the next. However,
emergencies such as an animal being tortured are investigated immediately, regardless
of the hour. Agents on duty telephone their office hourly, and the agent nearest the
scene is sent to investigate. All agents carry revolvers for humanely dispatching a
suffering animal. -

Last year we tracked down 5,396 cases of alleged cruelty, an average of 15 a day.
We welcome all complaints, even though anonymous callers make our job difficult.
Often insufficient information is reported and we have no way of pursuing the case
further. Many people are quick to accuse a neighbor of cruelty, but later refuse to
sign a complaint or appear in court as a witness. An ASPCA agent cannot sign a com-
plaint unless he has personally witnessed an act of cruelty.

Most cases we investigate are corrected after a warning. A follow-up Visit checks
the progress. But if that fails, we will prosecute. F orty-ﬁve cases ended in court action
last year — about one percent of all those investigated. Convictions in which offenders
were ﬁned or given jail sentences were secured in 38 cases.

In one case a big, burly 200-pound man was sentenced to three months in jail
for beating a kitten to death with a rake after sending his German shepherd after it.
The conviction was secured on the testimony of a 12-year-old girl who witnessed the
incident.

Another man pleaded guilty in court on charges that he stabbed his own dog with
a two-and-half-inch pocket knife in a drunken rage. Police found the dog, a female
wire-haired terrier, in a trash can. She was still gasping when an ASPCA ambulance
took her to the Manhattan Shelter, where her condition was found to be so hopeless
she was put to sleep.

An ASPCA agent was in court to help a neighbor who witnessed the stabbing give
his testimony. The sentence was 90 days in jail.

Inspections

The ASPCA was founded originally to curb the cruelty to work horses so pre-
valent in the 19th century. Although New York’s horse population has declined since

Laboratory inspections

This marks the tenth year the ASPCA has been inspecting laboratories using
animals for medical research. During this time we have drawn up a set of standards
to assure these animals a balanced diet; well-lighted, well-ventilated and clean wards;
adequate quarters; considerate attention; suﬂicient exercise; and, Where surgery is
performed, proper anesthesia and post-operative care.

Last year ASPCA veterinarians made a total of 85 unannounced inspections of 27
hospitals and laboratories, covering each at least three times during the year, and more
often where violations were uncovered.

Laboratories inspected are those which requisition animals for research from the
ASPCA under the 1952 New York State Metcalf-Hatch Law. While the law does not
give any humane organization the right to inspect laboratories, every one requisition-
ing animals from us has readily agreed to the inspections. By agreement with the New
York State Society for Medical Research, the ASPCA may withhold animals from any
institution failing to live up to our strict standards.

Most animals well cared for

For the most part, animals are healthy, happy, well-fed and properly exercised.
The wards are clean, bright and airy. In the half dozen cases where surgery was
observed adequate anesthesia was given and aftercare was equivalent to that given
human patients after an operation. Without exception, hospital directors have wel-
comed our veterinarians, and have been extremely cooperative and eager to correct
sub-standard conditions when they were pointed out.

Where violations existed they were not deliberate, but resulted from lack of
knowledge of animal needs. Among the most frequent violations were: cages not
cleaned often enough, dogs’ nails in need of clipping and inadequate ventilation, all
situations easily and quickly remedied. In several cases a shortage of personnel meant
cages could be cleaned only once a week. At our suggestion extra attendants were hired
so wards could be cleaned at least once a day. Fans or air conditioning easily improved
ventilation. Several other recommendations were for a new coat of paint, screening of
an exercise area and more frequent exercise periods.

Even more serious conditions received prompt attention when our veterinarians
reported them to hospital directors. For instance, the animal quarters of a Bronx
hospital were dirty, smelly, poorly ventilated and cockroach infested when inspected
last July. The ASPCA veterinarian recommended several reforms and rechecked three
weeks later. He was met by a clean, disinfectant odor and an attendant was busy clean-
ing, scrubbing and disinfecting. The ward had been air conditioned. The inspector
reported cages showed “liberal use of elbow grease and scrub brushes.”

Few exceptions

An even worse situation was found at a Brooklyn hospital. The one animal attend-
ant was unsupervised. The wards were dirty. Roach powder, ﬁlth, dust, animal food,
hair and cigarette butts covered the floor. Food barrels were uncovered, attracting
roaches and vermin. The quarters had a foul odor and were poorly ventilated. Unused
cages had never been cleaned after animals were removed. Empty jars, paint cans and
a discarded ﬁsh tank were strewn about.

39

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

Consequently, the Society is asking the New York State Legislature to increase
the dog license fee from $3 to $5. (See page 16.) This increase, we estimate, will
make the shelter Operation a self-paying service, putting a halt to the yearly drain on
our other funds.

Bequests and trust funds

Money or property may be bequeathed to the Society in a will. Such funds are
used for the general purposes of our work. Or trust funds may be set up specifying
how the principal or income may be used.

Memorial endowments

Many friends endow cages in our hospital or shelters in memory of relatives
or pets. The income is used to pay for the maintenance of the cage, and a plaque
bearing the name of the donor is placed on the cage. Dog cages are 35250, cat cages are
3150. Memorial plaques are also placed on endowed pieces of equipment in the hospital.

Contributions and memberships

Contributors who prefer to support one of our services may give to our Horse
Care Fund, Hospital Fund, Ad0ption Fund, Humane Work Fund, Humane Education
Fund, Automobile Fund or General Fund. Memberships are used for the general pur-
poses of the Society. Gifts of securities and property are welcome. All are tax deductible.

Special events

Several special fund-raising events are sponsored for the Adoption Service each
year by our Volunteer Committees in Manhattan, Westchester and Long Island.

In Manhattan the events include the Animal Kingdom Ball and the Ark, a shop
in which we sell quality items like silver, glass and jewelry donated by members and
friends. The shop operates for one week early in December in a store donated for the
purpose. Donated merchandise is tax deductible.

The Westchester Committee raises funds at a tea-dance known as Hi-Jinx for
Animals. In Long Island funds come from a tea-dance called Carnival for Animals.

The Society’s Horse Care Fund reaps proceeds from the sale of as many tickets
as we can dispose of for one night of the National Horse Show at Madison Square

Garden.

ments were installed this year and several new clinical laboratory tests are in use.
With the aid of blood counts, blood chemistries, urinalyses, fecal examinations and
bacteriological tests, this department gives crucial information to our veterinarians.
Armed with test results, the doctors can diagnose an animal patient’s ailments and
prescribe proper treatment.

The other half of the Pathology Department—the tissue pathology section ——is
new to our hospital. Tissues are removed from surgical patients or from deceased
animals and the specimens examined by the pathologist to determine the nature and
the cause of disease. A highly skilled technician processes the tissue for examination,
using several technical machines, donated by generous members, and delicate hand
, operations.

‘ The hospital’s facilities now include, in addition to the new Pathology Depart-
ment, two surgery suites, six examining rooms, a treatment room, a pharmacy, a
Radiology Department and a contagious disease ward.

 

 

Cancer research

We are continuing our cooperative cancer studies with Sloan-Kettering Institute
! for Cancer Research, St. Luke’s Hospital, New York Hospital at Cornell University and
other allied institutions. Currently under study are several investigational drugs being
used on clinical cases termed incurable. Special attention is being focused on malignant
lymphoma, a form of cancer. Many animals have been made more comfortable and
3, have had their lives prolonged through use of these drugs.

Staff

On the hospital staff are a director, ofﬁce manager, 14 veterinarians, eight attend-
ants, a tissue technician, a clinical laboratory and X-ray technician, a night supervisor,
night nurse, foreman and six office workers.

Our veterinary staff is active in the profession, contributing their ﬁndings to
others and keeping abreast of new information in the field. They attend professional
meetings, present technical papers at local, state and national meetings and publish

l papers in veterinary journals and other professional publications.
Weekly seminars for the regular staff, visiting veterinarians and allied scientists

 




‘93

 

the turn of the century, the remaining Dobbins still need our help. There are police
horses, riding academy horses, a half hundred which still haul junk and vegetable
wagons, and the hansom cab horses which drive sightseers around Central Park.

We protect them with regular inspections of stables, bridle paths, riding academies
and markets, watching for saddle sores, overriding and other abuses. ASPCA men
know every horse in the City by name and inspect them weekly. We operate two horse
ambulances to transport injured or inﬁrm horses to our hospital, where there is a
special horse stall. If an owner requests, we will destroy his horse humanely. During
the summer two trucks dispense water to hot, thirsty horses throughout the City.

Animals other than horses come under our protective mantle too. We regularly
inspect poultry markets, kennels, zoos, pet shops, slaughter houses, stockyards and
laboratories requisitioning animals from the Society.

Our agents also watch for cruelty at all special events involving animals. They
attend every performance and rehearsal of circuses and rodeos in New York City, and
every recognized horse show in New York State within a 65-mile radius of Manhattan.
We also check race tracks in and around New York City. '

Last year we made 8,809 inspections.

Our jurisdiction limited

The ASPCA has no jurisdiction outside New York State. We refer a report of
cruelty elsewhere to a humane society in the area.

The laws in New York State determine what constitutes cruelty and what does
not. If a case does not come under the laws, we are powerless to interfere. We cannot
indiscriminately take an animal away from an owner accused of cruelty. Depriving an
owner of his animal can be done only by a judge after a fair trial.

Our powers are limited to animal cruelty matters. Many violations don’t involve
cruelty, but may come under the Police, Fire or Health Departments, and we refer
such cases to the appropriate department. For instance, incessant barking is outside
our jurisdiction, unless the barking is caused by provable cruelty. If it is prolonged,
it can be classiﬁed a nuisance and becomes a matter for the police.

The Animalport

 

The ASPCA Animalport at New York International Airport is the only depot in
the Western Hemisphere built especially for airborne animals.

During the past few years airlines have been ﬂying more and more live cargo.
Frequently there are lay-overs in baggage rooms between ﬂights. Ordinary baggage
can wait until it’s called for, but living creatures have to be fed and cared for.

To ﬁll this gap, the ASPCA operates an Animalport in the Air Cargo Center of
New York International Airport, one of the world’s busiest airports. Our experienced
handlers house, feed, water and exercise airborne animals in de luxe accommodations
during stop-overs. Some animals stay a few hours, others a few weeks. The hostel,
located on a one and a quarter acre site, is open round the clock with a resident man-
ager in attendance.

Since it opened in 1958 this two-story shelter has cared for more than 175,000
walking, ﬂying and slithering animals. Included were 110 different types of fauna from

The ASPCA recommended a seven-point program, including better supervision,
better indoctrination of the attendant, an exhaust fan, covered food bins and an im-
mediate clean-up. When no improvement was noted after three weeks, the Society noti-
ﬁed the hospital’s Board of Directors, which then instituted an immediate reform pro-
gram. A follow-up visit soon after revealed clean runs and cage-s, scrubbed walls,
covered food containers and a new, animal-oriented attendant. Improvement was so
remarkable that several months later an ASPCA inspector rechecked and called the
laboratory a “model of scientiﬁc endeavor.”

But the serious violations uncovered at these two institutions were the exception,
rather than the rule. In many laboratories a stall veterinarian supervised the animal
quarters or a local veterinarian acted as consultant. A number of laboratories were
expanding their facilities with new, modern quarters incorporating the ultimate in
animal care.

One Brooklyn institution had installed a new type of plastic dog cage with a cast
aluminum door. Each dog had a self-operating drinking fountain. An automatic ﬂush
system, controlled by a timing device, cleaned each cage ﬂoor every two hours.

Among the 277,698 animals in laboratories during ASPCA inspections last year
were dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, ducks, turkeys, pigeons, sheep,
goats, turtles and horses. They came from many sources of course. During the period
the hospitals inspected requisitioned 2,029 animals from the ASPCA—1,416 dogs

and 613 cats. This is less than one percent of the total number of animals entrusted to
our care.

overdose of sleeping pills, the woman was taken to the hospital, and her pet was taken
to our Bronx Shelter where it was looked after for three weeks until the Department of
Health decided its fate. Since it is illegal for an individual to keep a wild animal in
New York City, the woman was ordered to get rid of the jaguar, and it wound up at
the Staten Island Zoo.

Wild animals

To the outsider New York is a city of concrete and steel, far from the jungles and
woods inhabited by animals. In truth, there are many woods and marshes in outlying
areas of Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx. And every so often a creature ventures
out of its forest home to become a bewildered city visitor.

We rescue these wild animals from the hazards of civilization and turn them over
to zoos or release them to freedom in their natural habitats. Other exotic animals
stowaway on banana boats, escape from zoos or come into New York City with owners
who are unaware that wild animals are not permitted.

Among the animals cared for last year were lions, alligators, chinchillas and oce-
lots. There were birds too, including hawks, java temple birds, mynahs, cardinals,
parrots, pheasants, a heron, cockatiel, osprey and owl.

Shelters outside New York City

The ASPCA operates three shelters outside New York City. Two are in Nassau
County, Long Island———one in Glen Cove, the other in Long Beach. The third is in
Westchester County at Elmsford.

 

We were invited into these neighboring communities several years ago. In Long
Island local government authorities requested us to take over their shelter work and
provide the shelters.

In Westchester the Western Westchester Humane Society, which was no longer
strong enough to fulﬁll its obligations in the area, appealed to us to take over its
work. This attractive suburban shelter located among wooded hills, was completely re-
furnished. We added landscaping, a year-round aviary, a new heating system and an
apartment for a caretaker.

In all three communities we are under contract to local governments.

I In Long Beach we serve only that city.

I In Glen Cove, besides our contract with that city, we also have contracts to

service nearby Sea Cliff, East Hills and Bayville.

I In Elmsford, while we do not service this town itself, we have contracts with
Irvington, Mount Pleasant, Tarrytown, North Tarrytown, Hastings-on-Hudson
and Dobbs Ferry.

In all these areas we are responsible for picking up any unleashed dog, whether
licensed or unlicensed, if it is oﬁ‘ its owner’s premises. There is a boarding fee for
animals not called for within 24 hours.

Penalties for allowing a dog to run loose vary because of differing local laws.
Some communities exact ﬁnes as well as redemption fees. In some instances ﬁnes are
collected by the police; in others we collect the penalties and turn them over to the
local government. We never retain either a ﬁne or a redemption fee.

The ASPCA:

The country’s oldest and
largest humane society

 

Annual report for the year May 1, 1961 to April 30, 1962

I Last year The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
cared for more than a quarter of a million sick, homeless, lost and unwanted
animals in our hospital and nine shelters. Many thousands more were pro-

tected from abuse because we maintain a constant vigil over pet shops,

poultry markets, bridle paths, slaughter houses, stables, stockyards, circuses,

horse shows and race tracks. More than 21,000 homeless animals were
welcomed into new homes, thanks to our Adoption Service. I These are
seemingly astronomical ﬁgures. But the ASPCA is not dealing in ﬁgures.
We are dealing with the most precious commodity there is—life itself.
Each helpless animal entrusted to our care is treated with compassion, and,
at the same time, expert attention. I I invite you to review the many ways

animals are served by the ASPCA, which I (‘er

has been guarding their welfare since 1866. President

The Metcalf—Hatch Law

The Metcalf—Hatch Law permits laboratories and hospitals approved by the State
Commissioner of Health, or if in New York City by the City Commissioner of Health,
to requisition animals for experimental purposes from public pounds and private
humane organizations to which public authority has been delegated by statute or con-
tract.

The ASPCA falls under the provisions of the law because:

1. Its authority to operate is granted by the New York State Legislature.

2. It is empowered by the New York State Legislature to issue dog licenses and

carry out the obligations imposed in the dog license law in New York City.

Challenged in the courts, the constitutionality of the law was upheld by the Court
of Appeals on July 14, 1954.

Animals subject to requisition

Animals subject to requisition must be unlicensed, unwanted or unclaimed, unless
the owner of a licensed dog or other animal offers it in writing for experimentation.

Under a previous law publicpounds and humane organizations were required to
hold any unlicensed, unwanted or unclaimed animal for 48 hours. Under the Metcalf-
Hatch Law each animal must be held for an additional three days, during which the
animal may be reclaimed by its owner or adopted.

If the animal is then allocated to a laboratory or hospital, the humane organiza-
tion or pound is reimbursed a reasonable amount for the animal’s maintenance during
the extra three-day waiting period. In the case of the ASPCA, the New York City
Commissioner of Health has established as a reasonable amount 66 2/ 3¢ a day for a
cat and $1.50 a day for a dog. Both amounts are considerably lower than the average
kennel boarding rates.

Animals are transported from ASPCA shelters to laboratories in a custom-built
vehicle operated by the New York State Society for Medical Research. The vehicle was
constructed to speciﬁcations suggested by the ASPCA.

Awards

 

In recognition of outstanding achievements where animals are concerned, we
present the following awards:

Medal of Honor

The medal, accompanied by a Certiﬁcate of Merit, goes to a person who has
performed an heroic service for animals or to an animal that has rescued a person.
Recipients this year included a Seeing Eye dog that saved three people from possible
asphyxiation by barking a warning of escaping gas during the night. Among the
human recipients were a volunteer ﬁreman who revived with mouth-to-mouth breathing
a kitten he rescued in a ﬁre, and a railroad brakeman who drove 120 miles in deep
snow in the middle of the night to rescue a dog caught on a fence.

Pets in taxis

A taxi driver in New York City may turn
down a fare accompanied by an animal not
in a carrier, according to the rules for cab-
bies drawn up by the Police Department.

The regulation, on the books for years, was
given recent newspaper publicity leading to
consternation among humane-minded citizens
who believed it to be a new rule.

The regulation states that a cabbie may
turn down a fare escorting an animal except
where the animal is “adequately secured in a
kennel case or other suitable container, or
the person is blind and is accompanied by a
properly harnessed or muzzled guide dog.”

The rule gives the driver the right to turn
down passengers accompanied by a dog not
in a carrier, but most cabbies seem to like
animals and don’t object to carrying them. It
is regrettable that a sick or injured animal
bound for an animal hospital is sometimes
turned away. But, truthfully, owners them-
selves are frequently to blame. Many cabbies
complain that pets are allowed to soil seats
and even evacuate in a cab. More drivers
would welcome pets if the animals were
properly controlled.

ANIMAL PROTECTION would like to hear
comments from readers on this problem.

Volunteer activities

 

Volunteers perform a Vital function for
the ASPCA in raising funds through special
events and in spreading information about
the Society’s services. The Volunteer Di-
vision, under the direction of Mrs. George
Hayman, has been active since 1951. Many
members who joined eleven years ago are
still serving. The Men’s Committee, under
Walter S. Mack, is comprised of prominent
men in the community.

Funds are raised through the Animal King-
dom Ball, Hi-Jinx for Animals, Carnival for
Animals, a beneﬁt at the National Horse
Show and the Ark, a pre-Christmas shop.

Other services
The three shelters also offer other humane activities:
I We call for unwanted animals on request from homes in the areas where we
have contracts for a $1 fee.
I We call for dead animals for a $5 fee.
I We accept unwanted animals at the shelters for adoption or to be put to sleep,
regardless of where the animal comes from.
I We ﬁnd homes for the homeless through our intensive and extensive adoption
service.
I We rescue pets in distress and wild animals in the contract areas.
There is no charge for the last three services, but contributions are always wel-
come.

Hospital with a heart

 

“No animal in need of care is ever turned away,” is a slogan our hospital is
proud to live up to. A puppy weakened by dread distemper . . . a kitten with a needle
lodged in her throat . . . a dog badly hurt in a car accident— these are some of the
animals treated in our Hospital and Clinic last year.

Expansion program

These patients are getting a higher level of care than ever before, thanks to an
expansion and reorganization program started in 1961.

During 1951, the hospital’s ﬁrst year at 441 East 92nd Street, we cared for 19,000
patients. Last year we treated 31,266 an increase of 60 percent. To render better care
and take advantage of newer and more efﬁcient methods, the hospital last year under-
went a $50,000 expansion program.

The revamping centered around an enlarged two-pronged Pathology Department.
The clinical pathology section continues its work in a more efﬁcient area. New instru-

skunks, polar bears, foxes, leopards, chinchillas and monkeys, to anteaters, lions, tigers,
elephants, cattle, sheep and lizards.

Among the 55,297 guests at the Animalport last year were snow leopards, gorillas,
aardvarks, sea lions and walruses. The odd fellow who made the 110th type was a
phalanger—or flying squirrel, native to Australia. The creature was en route to a
Virginia zoo.

Most of the exotic animals are imported from Asia, Africa and Europe by zoos
and dealers. Many animals are exported by cattle breeders to needy peoples abroad.
Race horses traveling between tracks in the US. and Europe are frequent stop-over
guests.

Ninety percent of the dogs belong to Gl’s in Europe. When they get transferred to

the US. they send their pets home by air express. Sometimes they arrive days after,
and their pets have to wait.

Facilities

Dogs, cats and other small animals are housed in individual kennels with adjoin-
ing outdoor runs. There are 12 box stalls for horses which can be converted into a

large indoor corral for farm animals. Horses are exercised in a spacious outdoor

paddock.

There is a temperature-controlled section for tropical birds and animals, isolation
cages for the sick and injured, a fully-equipped veterinary clinic, indoor and outdoor
loading areas and a dietary kitchen with a freezer and electric stove. Diets prepared in
this kitchen range from live meal worms for foxes to bamboo roots for pandas, raw

meat for lions and alfalfa for elephants. We procure health certiﬁcates and supply
traveling crates.

Dog IicenSes

 

Early in 1962 the ASPCA, which has handled the dog license work in New York
City since 1894, requested the New York State Legislature to increase the annual dog
license fee from $3 to $5. The legislature adjourned without passing the law.

We were forced to request the increase because we have been steadily losing
money on the license operation since 1956. The aggregate loss in the past six years is
more than three-quarters of a million dollars. The law of 1894 which turned over to
the ASPCA the job of handling the animal work for the city intended that the license
fee compensate us sufﬁciently to reimburse us for the cost of such services. The Board
of Managers feels that the ASPCA cannot properly invade funds contributed for the
humanitarian and charitable work of the Society to make up deﬁcits due to other
activities.

More than a year ago the Society’s accountants began a thorough review of the
ﬁnancial results of the services we render to the City as against the revenues from dog
licenses. The review conﬁrmed the fact that the services are costing us far more than
we are receiving in license revenue. The deﬁcit last year alone was $186,800, and the
aggregate deﬁcit since 1956 was $757,800.

Dog population decreasing

Last year 259,306 dogs were licensed in New York City. This is 16,819 fewer
than there were in 1954. Two primary reasons for the decreasing New York dog
population are:

1. Many families with children and pets are moving to suburbs.
2. Many publicly ﬁnanced and private housing developments do not permit dogs.

 

 




 

 

 

 

EDITORIAL

View on experimentation

On several occasions I have gone on record
as to the ASPCA’S View on experimentation.
Yet, because there still seems to be confusion
in the minds of some people, I shall do so
again.

As far back as the spring of 1959, when
presenting the Society’s Medal of Honor to
Baker, the squirrel monkey which preceded
man into outer space, I was quoted in the
press throughout the country to the effect
that the award was given “as an expression
of ASPCA’s awareness that it is time for the
humane movement to record its realization
that it is only through carefully controlled
scientiﬁc research . . . that further progress

to the mutual beneﬁt of man and animal can
be achieved.”

This was intended to recognize both the
necessity that animals, as Well as man, must
on occasion be called on to accept risks, and
indeed to make sacriﬁces, for the general
good of the community which includes them
both, and more speciﬁcally and closer to our
day to day lives, the need for professionally
conducted experimentation to develop the
treatments which will prevent or cure the ills
and prolong the lives of animals as well as
mankind.

At the same time, true to the humane pur-
poses for which the ASPCA was founded and
continues to operate, we insist that any ex-
perimentation be conducted under conditions
that eliminate pain and suffering to the maxi-
mum extent consistent with the particular
objective, and be limited to areas where
proper authority has determined that beneﬁt
to the general welfare may be expected to
be developed.

Nunzio D’Ambrosio, a ﬁve-year-old blind
Italian boy, thrills to touch of a puppy the
ASPCA carefully selected to replace his dog
which died. The boy was brought to the US.
to ﬁnd whether anyone could restore his lost
eyesight, and a double deception spared him
sadness. No one told him that American eye
specialists agreed he would never see again.
And no one told him his pet had sickened and
died. He thought the puppy who joined him at
the ship—it was identical to his puppy in
shape, weight and texture— was his dog,
ready for the return voyage to Italy.

William Ryan:
friend to
half a million
animals

50 years of rescuing
cats, dogs, apes,
lions, toads, horses
and elephants

or 50 years when anyone wanted to get
F a cat out of a chimney, pull a horse out
of a sewer, get an ape out of a bed or corral a
footloose lion, William Ryan has been the
man to see. On July 12 Mr. Ryan, who has
had more experience with nature’s creatures
than even Noah, rounded out a half century
as an agent for the ASPCA. American-born
son of a father who was a horse trainer in
Ireland, Ryan is probably the nation’s senior
active humane agent in terms of continuous
service.

He joined the Society in 1912 as driver of
the ﬁre-engine-red horse ambulance. “I was
19 and felt like a king driving that ambu-
lance,” he recalls. “It had patent leather
upholstery and brass mountings.” In those
days there were 175,000 horses in Manhattan
alone, and Ryan and his ambulance would
be called upon to make at least a half dozen
trips a day to aid injured horses.

He once rescued a horse in a funeral
cortege high up on the Queensboro Bridge.
The animal had 'caught one hind leg in the
latticework and was hanging head down over
the East River. Then there was the time he
had to maneuver a horse through a dining
room after it got stuck under the stairway
with two legs trapped in garbage cans.

During his 50 years as an animal’s best
friend, Ryan has perfected the tricks of his
trade. He learned to pull horses out of man-
holes by greasing the horse and the hole. He
learned to get a horse’s leg out of a sewer
catch basin by removing its shoe and whit-
tling down the hoof.

In his long career the ASPCA’s ace trouble-
shooter has captured a bull that deserted an
act in the old Madison Square Garden to
take refuge in the ladies’ room, cornered a
parade-deserting elephant that went on a
rampage in residential Yonkers and trapped
a red ape discovered sitting on a bed dis-

park (right).

 

 




 

it?

Despite the Society’s efforts to curtail outgo where possible, we predict that
annual expenses will increase progressively upward from an estimated $1 million a
year. Coupled with the decline in dogs licensed, the increased expenses would result
in an immediate annual deﬁcit of $250,000.

Legislation introduced

Accordingly, we arranged for legislation to be introduced in each house of the
State Legislature increasing the annual dog license fee from $3 to $5. This bill was
passed with no difficulty in the State Senate. After considerable discussion it was
passed in the Assembly by an overwhelming majority, and we were advised that it had
been cleared and sent to the Governor’s office for his signature.

Unfortunately, this advice appeared to have been faulty inasmuch as on the last
day of the legislative session the bill was called back on the floor of the Assembly
and referred again to its Codes Committee. Since this committee had adjourned for
the session, the bill was automatically killed.

We do not see how we can continue the yearly drain on the funds which have been
contributed to us for other purposes such as has in the last few years been required to
make up a deﬁcit on the dog license work. The Board of Managers sees no alternative
but to return to the Legislature next year in the hOpe that the relief which we urgently
need is granted. If we succeed, it will be the ﬁrst dog license increase in 13 years.

establish themselves as leaders and the rest
are ranked right on down the line.”

Recreation at Otisville consists mainly of
rolling in the dirt. The winter sport, rolling
and tramping in the snow, is even more fun.

A special geriatric diet consists of crushed
oats, corn, molasses and bran. “Two carrots
a day help keep the coat glossy,” said Dr.
Kraft, a veterinarian, who supervises a staff
of 43 caretakers, groundkeepers and labora-
tory technicians, and 17 buildings. Dr. Kraft
hopes to save an old, unused barn that once
housed dairy cows and remodel it with stalls
for 75 horses.

Her favorite horse is Grandpa, oldest of
the retirees at 27, and one of the few non-
police horses. “He was a draft horse,” she
said, “and when his teammate, Johnny, died
a couple of years ago he brooded for a long
time. Even now he won’t associate with the

other horses.”

The farm’s only female horse is Debbie,
who used to give rides to children, but is
now almost totally blind. A pal leads her
around. A comparative youngster is Custer,
who retired from the police force at eleven,
after developing a heart condition. A sou-
venir of his pavement-pounding days in New
York City is a scar on his rump, suffered
when he backed into a phone booth.

Three dogs and several cats have unlimited
run of the place. “Neighboring farmers and
townspeople are constantly bringing us
strays,” said Dr. Kraft, whose own pet, Miss
Poo, a brown dog of nondescript ancestry,
barks an official greeting to all visitors.

Last spring Otisville had an unexpected
population explosion. “A ram sneaked into
the female sheep quarters,” recalled Dr.
Kraft, “and inseminated every ewe on the
place.” The result was 46 baby lambs, in-

cluding a couple of sets of twins.

Use of the license money

The law stipulates that license fees be used for the following purposes:

1. Issuing licenses and renewals.

2. Carrying out all other provisions of the Dog License Law (supplying tags,
notifying dog owners when to renew licenses, returning lost dogs to owners,
inspectors’ salaries, clerical work, etc.).

3. Collecting unlicensed dogs (and stray cats which do not wear a collar with
the name and address of the owner).

4. Maintaining shelters in New York City for lost, strayed or homeless animals.
All animals must be kept for a minimum of 48 hours before destruction, or if
they have been requisitioned by laboratories for experimental purposes under
the provisions of the Metcalf—Hatch Law, they must be held for an additional
three days.

5. Providing a painless death for animals not redeemed by their owners or
adopted by new owners.

Who needs a license

Under the law every dog housed in New York City must be licensed, regardless
of age. From the moment a puppy is born until it dies it requires a license, which is
renewable each year before April 30.

Licenses are $3 and can be obtained in person or by mail from the ASPCA office
in the borough where the owner lives. Applications by mail should contain the name,
address and telephone number of the owner, plus the name, age, breed, sex, color and
markings of the dog, and should be accompanied by a check or money order for $3
payable to the ASPCA.

The ASPCA does not collect license fees outside New York City.

Lost dogs

Last year 5,788 lost dogs were returned to their owners, mainly because they
were found wearing license tags. The license number is quickly checked in our cross-
ﬁle. We have two ﬁles: one numerical and one alphabetical according to the owner’s
name.

Our lost and found departments also do their best to trace owners of unlicensed
dogs. They read lost and found columns, check newspaper ads and telephone calls.
But no system is as sure as the tag. The ASPCA has returned lost dogs to owners
as far away as Florida, California and South America by tracing the tag number.

 

QUESTIONS FREQUENTLY ASKED ABOUT LICENSES
I have two homes, one of which is in New York City. Must my dog have a New York
City license?
Yes. But visitors do not need tags if they are in the City only a few days.

Can I get another tag if mine is lost, or if I want several for different collars?
Yes, additional tags are $1 each.

If my dog dies, may I transfer his tag to a new dog?

No. Licenses are not transferable to a new dog because the description on the
license certiﬁcate would not ﬁt the new dog.

Suppose I give my dog away. Can the new owner use the same tag?

Yes. But the new owner should notify the ASPCA.

telephone hour daily when owners can talk directly with him. Staff members are not
permitted to prescribe over the telephone.

We can seldom schedule the exact hour of an operation because accident cases,
recent fractures and other emergencies have priority.

Daynemouth ward

Animals suffering from contagious diseases such as canine hepatitis, canine dis-
temper and feline enteritis, are isolated in a special ward to prevent the spread of
these diseases to other hospitalized patients. Separated from the rest of the hospital,
the Daynemouth Ward was made possible by a donor whose particular interest is the
control of communicable diseases.

Because cases treated in this area are highly contagious, preventing the spread of
disease is of utmost importance. Therefore, owners are not permitted to visit animals
in this ward. But they can see their pets through a plate glass window and communicate
with them over a two-way radio.

We prevent the spread of infection in this ward with ultra-violet lighting, exhaust
fans, steam cleaning, anti-bacteria and anti-virus sprays, sterilized feeding dishes, etc.

Fees

No animal is ever turned away from the ASPCA Hospital. If an owner proves
he can’t afford our regular fees, he pays what he can. If an owner can pay nothing,
fees are waived entirely. Forty percent of our patients are charity cases.

Finding homes for the homeless

 

Finding homes for the homeless is a major responsibility of any welfare organiza-
tion worthy of its name. With ASPCA it’s a mission well rewarded when thousands of
insecure, frightened cats and dogs are transformed into proud, conﬁdent pets.

We have more than tripled the number of animals placed in new homes over the
past ten years by placing added emphasis on this phase of our program. Last year
homes were found for a record 21,312 pets. Animals may be adopted free of charge
from any of our eight shelters. There is only the license fee for a dog to be kept in

New York City.

Special adoption

To encourage adoptions a Special Adoption Service was inaugurated this year.
The service is designed to ﬁll requests from people who have their hearts set on
adopting a speciﬁc breed of dog or eat. If you wan-t a Siamese cat or an English bull
dog, ﬁle your request with the Special Adoption Clerk on duty at the Manhattan
Shelter weekdays from 1 pm. to 5 pm. She will check incoming animals at each of
the Society’s shelters every day and notify you if your heart’s desire comes in. Of
course, we can ﬁll requests only from the animals turned over to us for adoption, so
if you’ve requested a rare breed you may have a long wait.

Rates vary according to the size and type of animal. For further information about
the Animalport, call OLympia 6-6042, or write the ASPCA Animalport, Air Cargo
Center, New York International Airport, Jamaica 30, N. Y.

Bite cases

 

While a New York City law requires that all animals accused of biting must be
examined by a veterinarian, the ASPCA has no jurisdiction in these cases. They are
handled by the New York City Department of Health.

But the ASPCA does provide the Department of Health with free space in our
ﬁve borough shelters for examining animals accused of biting. We also provide facilities
for housing animals the Department decides to hold for observation. Last year 23,635
animals were examined by the Health Department in ASPCA shelters, and 5,277
animals were held for observation.

The owner of an animal accused of biting must do one of two things:

1. Take the animal to the ASPCA shelter in the borough where he lives to- be

examined by a Department of Health veterinarian.

2. Or take the animal to a licensed veterinarian who will examine the dog at the

owner’s expense, and submit his report to the Department of Health.

The examining veterinarian may:

1. Release the dog for future examination.

2. Or have it held for observation.

3. In the case of a third bite within a 24-month period, the dog must be sur-

rendered to the Department of Health for hearing and decision.

Dead animals

 

The ASPCA provides three services for pets which have died:

1. Pick-up of a pet which has passed on. The fee is $5.

2. Arrange for cremation. Through an arrangement with Marble Hill Crematory
for Pet Animals, the ASPCA will have the animal picked up and cremated.
The charge is $45 to $60 for a dog, depending on size; $35 for a cat. Ashes

will be delivered to the owner if desired.

3. If burial is preferred, we refer the owner to one of several cemeteries in Long
Island or Westchester.

Humane education

Because we believe that teaching children kindness to animals can have far-
reachlng effects, we place great emphasis on our education program. Children who

consolately holding the hand of its dead
master.

An escaped lion was one of Ryan’s greatest
challenges. It had been his job to take a
dozen lions to the shelter one day when an
expressman dumped their cages on the side-
walk of a midtown street. The animal’s
owner, a stranded South American woman
lion tamer, had been unable to pay for haul-
ing them.

The ASPCA supplied the food and every
day the trainer came to feed her lions. How-
ever, one day she failed to show up and
the kennelman decided to feed them him-
self. He opened a cage door and before he
knew it a lion was loose in the room. The
kennelman’s yell brought Ryan on the run.
As Ryan entered one door the kennelman had
his hand on the knob of another door ready
to run out the back way.

Ryan pulled his 45 automatic and trained
it—not on the snarling lion ——but on the
kennelman. “If you move another step, I’ll
shoot you,” Ryan shouted. “You’re going
to stay here and help me get that lion back
in the cage. Get on top of that cage and pull
up the door.” The kennelman did as he was
told. Then Ryan cautiously stalked the lion
with a pitchfork. He suddenly jabbed at the
beast, discharged his gun at the ceiling and
roared, “Get in there.” With one spring the
animal dived for the cage and landed inside.

Stable Fire

Ryan was once awarded a medal for rescu-
ing 51 work horses trapped on the second
floor of a stable while flames raced through
the lower level, destroying many other ani-
mals. It was contrary to all the rules of ﬁre
ﬁghting, but Ryan prevailed on ﬁremen to
open a huge skylight on the building and
break out windows at each end. A draft of
air swept through the second ﬂoor and all
the horses lived through six hours of intense
heat and smoke until the ﬁre was contained.
Then Ryan led them through a window onto

the roof of an adjoining building, since the
ramp had been burned away.

Another night he rescued 76 horses from
a burning barn. His problem was then to
keep the animals warm until he could get
them indoors. He asked police to break in-
to a bed cover factory next door, conﬁs-
cated a pile of covers and made impromptu
horse blankets out of them. Then he walked
into the nearest bar, stepped up to the bar-
tender and ordered a case of whiskey, which
be promptly administered to the freezing
horses.

Toad in Cornerstone

Many years ago Ryan stopped a hat de-
signer from sealing a live toad in the corner-
stOne of her building. She had heard a
legend that a toad in the cornerstone brings
good luck to the building owner. As the
French Consul General and other VIP guests
looked on, Ryan halted the ceremony in no
uncertain terms. He then refused to permit
the designer to keep her “lucky” toad in the
basement. A compromise was reached ﬁnally
when the toad was set up in a penthouse
pool complete with toady comforts.

Ryan hasn’t kept any sort of count, but
he estimates that he’s met at least 500,000
mammals, birds, ﬁsh, reptiles and insects
during his half century of animal work.
Among his dramatic encounters was a young
monkey escaped from a freighter shipment
at a North River pier. The simian broke into
crates of ﬁgs, kippers and bags of nuts,
threw them at his pursuers and scattered
them on piers. For six weeks Figgy —— named
for his weakness for ﬁgs—sabotaged long-
shoremen. He even grabbed a sugar bowl
from a lunch counter and beaned a mes-
senger boy.

Ryan was dispatched by the ASPCA to
capture the clever marauder who eluded
traps, food bait and mirrors—which mon-
keys like—and came through with a ro-
mantic device. He borrowed a female mon-
key from the Bronx Zoo and placed her in

hear talks by physicians, private veterinarians, research workers and members of our
staff. This exchange contributes to better patient care.

The internship program inaugurated in 1960 continues to give young veterinarians
a formal course in post-graduate training. This year we have three interns.

Hospital hours

Clinic hours are from 9 a.m. to 12 noon, and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through
Saturday, except holidays. There is emergency service evenings from 4 to 7, and on
Sundays and holidays from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. There is no outpatient service from
7 p.m. to 9 a.m.

Animals are examined in order of their arrival in the reception room. Of course,
emergencies are taken ﬁrst. To avoid waiting, appointments may be made in advance
for an added fee, and a client may see a particular doctor at a speciﬁed time.

Night emergency service

Hospital veterinarians participate in the night emergency service sponsored by
the Veterinary Medical Association of New York City. We rotate turns of night duty
with other veterinary hospitals to provide emergency service for pet owners in Man-
hattan, Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. every day. Owners who
dial OR 9-1964 will be given the name and telephone number of a veterinarian on
duty in their borough that night.

Ambulance service

If an owner can’t bring his animal to the hospital, we will send an ambulance.

Ambulance service is available 24 hours a day. The fee depends on the distance from
the hospital.

If a pet must be hospitalized

Most patients are examined in the out-patient clinic and home treatment is pre-

scribed. But many must be hospitalized. In these cases:

I We urge owners to protect pets by authorizing temporary immunizations
against contagious diseases, regardless of previous vaccinations, unless the ex-
amining veterinarian recommends otherwise.

Each hospitalized animal has a temperature-controlled individual cage, dis-
infected after each patient.

Fresh water in individual containers is changed three times a day.

Animals are fed a well-balanced basic ration, with speciﬁc diets prescribed
by the doctor.

Dogs are exercised when possible in outdoor runs on the roof at least twice
a day— morning and afternoon.

Each of the 14 veterinarians makes his ward rounds for 45 minutes every day.
A record card is posted on the kennel identifying the animal, the nature of
the ailment and the treatment prescribed.

Sanitary and aseptic conditions are controlled to the best of human ability.
Examining and opera-ting tables are disinfected after each patient. Kennels
and outdoor runs are disinfected daily. As in human hospitals, surgeons “scrub

up” with antiseptics before an operation and wear caps, face masks, gowns
and gloves.

For owner’s information

We realize owners are anxious when their pets are hospitalized. To make it
easier to ﬁnd out a pet’s progress, we set aside two hours a day, between 2 p.m. and
4 p.m. when an owner can call and inquire about the patient. Each veterinarian has a

Etﬁ-cat campaign

The New York City Transit Authority has
adopted a cat as the symbol and spokesman
for its passenger courtesy program. Etti-cat
is appearing on a series of posters in sub-
ways and buses urging passengers to give
their seats to old ladies and step lively get-
ting on and off. In another poster he con-
ducts an anti-litter campaign.

Etti-cat was photographed fOr the Transit
Authority by his owner, Miss JoMary Mc-
Cormick, who adopted him eight years ago
when she found him, appropriately enough,
in the subway. Pipsqueak, his real name, was
once a patient in the ASPCA Hospital, where
he received round-the-clock care for a very
serious ailment.

a rigged trap. Figgy fell for the bait, won
the girl, but lost his freedom.

Out of necessity Ryan has come up with
a number of inventions. It was he who ﬁgured
out how to rescue cats who climb trees and
are afraid to come down. He invented a pole
patterned after the sticks grocers use to pick
cans or cereal boxes from high shelves. He
thought up another instrument for retrieving
cats from chimneys and devised a horse
sling—now in general use. It can be at-
tached to the animal quickly and can be used
to hoist it out of rivers, cellars and excava-
tions. Humane societies throughout the world
also use Ryan’s pole lasso for grabbing dogs
and his sling for lowering small animals from
roofs or windows.

Though Ryan is eligible, he has no inten-
tion of retiring from active work. As a
matter of fact, he’s just been appointed
ASPCA’s one and only inspector and train-
ing instructor, assigned to the training of
new Special Agents. At the Society’s Annual
Meeting last May William Ryan was hon-
ored with a citation which read, “He devoted
his life to animals, not because it was his
duty, but because he was their friend.” And
he has proved it time and time again.

Penalties

Owners who have not licensed their dogs may be summoned before a magistrate
and ﬁned up to $10. If the ﬁne is not paid, owners can be imprisoned up to ten days.
If an unlicensed dog is picked up on the street, the owner must pay a $3 redemption
fee, plus the $3 license.

The Society has 21 uniformed license ofﬁcers who enforce the law. Each ofﬁcer
is assigned to one area in the City. He Visits residential buildings in his area to make
certain every dog living there has a license. In addition, owners are reminded by mail
early in March that licenses must be renewed by April 30. Reminders also appear in
newspapers and on radio and television.

Shelter services

 

We have ﬁve shelters in New York City, one in each borough. The four-ﬂoor
Manhattan Shelter houses our hospital and administrative offices. The newest New
York City shelter is our red-brick Bronx Shelter, erected in 1956 to replace an old
outmoded building.

By contrast, the Queens Shelter, in a picturesque, rustic setting, includes a 100-
year-old farm house which serves as an adoption ward. Three other buildings house
the kennels, license ofﬁce and garage. The 30-year-old Brooklyn Shelter, which cared
for nearly 49,000 animals last year, handles more animals than any other shelter
in the country. The vine-covered shelter in Richmond, built in 1935, is a landmark
known to almost every resident on Staten Island.

The services performed in these shelters are listed below. (For services in Nassau
and Westchester see “Shelters outside New York City,” page 21.)

Unwanted animals

A cherished pet becomes too old or hopelessly ill. A family is moving and can’t
take the pet along to the new home. An unwanted litter of kittens becomes a burden.
In all these cases the ASPCA stands ready to help. All our shelters accept any animal
brought in any time of day or night at no charge. Our ﬂeet of 45 ambulances will also
call at homes for unwanted animals. The animals are then put up for adoption or
painlessly put to sleep, according to the owner’s request. So many owners have a
change of heart after offering a pet for a new home that we hold all such animals
for 24 hours before putting them up for adoption. This gives the original owner a
chance to reclaim his pet.

For many years the ASPCA didn’t charge for home pick-ups. But we often
had to make two or three calls for one animal— some owners changed their minds,
others weren’t home, or gave pets to neighbors, and still others brought animals to
the shelters before we got to their homes.

And so in 1954, because of the increasing cost of duplicate calls, it became a
question of eliminating home pick-ups entirely, or making a nominal charge. (Many
animal welfare organizations do not call at homes for animals.) We decided to
charge a $1 fee for each call for unlicensed dogs, cats, birds or any other animal.
Licensed dogs in the ﬁve boroughs are called for at no charge. The fee now pays for
about one quarter the cost of the pick-up service.

Alfred B. Maclay Trophy

The purpose is to emphasize to young riders the importance of kindness and
gentleness in handling their mounts. It is open to children under 18 who compete in
the ASPCA Horsemanship Event at recognized horse shows throughout the country.
The charge for conducting this class is 3510. Winners of the individual shows compete
in the National Championship Event at the National Horse Show each year. This
year’s winner, Bernard Traurig, received a replica of the original challenge trophy

donated by the late Alfred B. Maclay in 1933.

Henry Bergh Trophy

This horsemanship trophy is open to young riders at non-recognized shows
throughout the country. Shows may hold this class free of charge. The trophy is
awarded yearly to the junior who accumulates the most points in competition in the
Henry Bergh Class in various shows. At the end of the year an extra ﬁve points is
given any entrant who can prove he has cared for and groomed his own horse. The
trophy itself is donated to the Society. This year’s silver tray was donated by Frank
Carroll. The winner was Sue Jamieson of Trenton, N. J.

Veterinary scholarship

Since 195-6 we have offered a $300 veterinary scholarship at Cornell University.
The scholarship goes to a fourth year veterinary student chosen by the faculty on the
basis of need, scholarship and general competence. It has been made possible by Secor
Farms Riding Academy, which has contributed to us the proceeds of its annual horse

show, to continue the scholarships through 1964. This year’s recipient is Thomas John
Lane, of Manlius, N. Y.

James Hopkins Award

This sterling silver plaque is presented for the best improvement in the humane
slaughter of food animals. The late James Hopkins left the Society a trust fund to
be used speciﬁcally for this purpose. The award has been made ﬁve times. No Hopkins
Award was made this year.

have developed an understanding of animals grow into more responsible, compassionate
adults.

Junior memberships

One way in which we encourage children to become interested in animals is our
Junior Membership program, open to individual children under 18 and organized
groups of children such as Scouts, Campﬁre Girls, Y’s, and other community groups.
Dues are $1 a year for an individual or for the entire group.

All Juniors and Junior Groups receive:

1. Subscriptions to the ASPCA magazine ANIMAL PROTECTION and ASPCA

NEWS BULLETIN.

2. A visit by appointment on Saturday to our Manhattan Shelter and Hospital at
441 East 92nd Street, consisting of:

I A short discussion on animal care, followed by questions and answers on
children’s individual pet problems.

I Demonstrations with live animals showing how to brush, comb, give medicine
to a pet, etc.

I Sound and color ﬁlms about animals.

I Children can watch and often cuddle some of the animals in our classroom,
including parakeets, hamsters, a kinkajou, ﬁsh, white mice, snakes, chinchillas,
guinea pigs, parrots, a dog and a cat.

I Conducted tour of the hospital and shelter, highlighting the dog and cat adop-
tion wards.

. Demonstration of rescue equipment for small animals.

I A packet of educational material (presented to the leader in the case of a
group).

3. Invitation to the annual Junior Jamboree held in June. This culminates the
yearly Junior program and includes refreshments and entertainment with
participation by the children themselves.

4. Junior Groups receive a certiﬁcate of membership, while individual Junior
Members get a button and membership card.

In addition, individual Junior Members have :the opportunity to assist the Humane
Education Department in conducting the tours, feeding the animals, walking the class-
room dog, etc. Time spent is credited toward a Junior Achievement Award which is
made after 50 hours of service in one year and is presented at the Junior Jamboree.

School children

Saturday is the day set aside in the classroom for Junior Members, but weekdays
are booked up with classes of school children and their teachers. Last year 16,250
children visited the shelter, saw ﬁlms, took the grand tour of the hospital and learned
something about animal care.

Disturbed and handicapped children come to our classroom too, and enjoy the
program perhaps even more than normal children. Blind children squeal with delight
when they touch the rabbit’s furry ears. Deaf children glow with pride when they
bravely drape the boa constrictor around their necks after the instructor has shown
them how.

Last year we received visually handicapped children from RS. 129, retarded
youngsters from RS. 189, PS 23 and Junior High School 126, physically handicapped

Dog training for boys and girls

Parents whose children clamor for a dog no longer have recourse to the old brush-
off, “You know who’ll end up with the work.” Not since publication of “Dog Train-
ing for Boys and Girls,” an easy training guide designed to teach youngsters from
eight up to train their dogs without parental supervision.

 

Author Blanche Saunders, obedience trainer for 27 years, 17 of them as training
instructor in the ASPCA’s classes, shows boys and girls how to teach their pets good
manners and practical obedience. Illustrated with 124 drawings by Haris Petie, the

book covers the puppy’s early training, obedience training, tricks, the problem dog
and making friends for the dog.

Junior Achievement Award

Four Juniors won the award this year.

Humane slaughter legislation

   

New York State law

In 1962, for the fourth year in a row, the ASPCA campaigned for a law making
it compulsory to slaughter food animals humanely in New York State. Despite vigorous
support from the press and humanitarians throughout the state, the Legislature again
failed to pass the law.

The ASPCA, along with the New York State Humane Association (we are a
member) threw our support behind Assemblyman William S. Calli’s bill, but it was
never reported out of committee. Our representatives spent many weeks in Albany
talking to legislators. They tramped untold miles of corridors. They sat for hours
in anterooms waiting to see Senators and Assemblymen. We sent letters to every
legislator. We sought press and voter support. A majority of the legislators appeared
strongly in favor of our proposed humane slaughter bills, but at the last minute they
backed away and failed to act.

The opposition this year, as in previous years, came from Orthodox Jewish groups
who objected on grounds that such legislation posed a threat to religious freedom.
They argued that a humane slaughter law would interfere with shehitah, the traditional
kosher method of slaughter.

The fact is that Assemblyman Calli’s bill would have protected shehitah, a
method in which a sharp knife severs the arteries in the neck. The Calli Bill recognized
this as humane. It would have outlawed only the method used to restrain animals for
slaughter. In traditional preparation fully conscious animals are shackled, thrown and
hoisted by a chain biting cruelly into one hind leg. They dangle in agony, suffering
unbelievable pain while waiting for the knife to slit their throats.

The Calli Bill also included a clause to exempt from its provisions any species of
livestock for ritual slaughter until the U. S. Department of Agriculture approved a
method of restraining that species. A method for cattle is already available. On
January 12 the Meat Inspection Division announced approval of a new type of re-
straining pen for ritualistic slaughter of cattle developed by Cross Brothers Meat
Packers, Inc., of Philadelphia. The pen, which meets the department’s sanitary
standards, permits bleeding of cattle in a standing position.

Many prominent Jewish leaders have declared the device compatible with ritual-
istic requirements. Similar devices for restraining sheep and calves are now being
studied, and further research continues on gas immobilization, mechanical stunning
and electrical immobilization.

SKIN DISEASES IN CATS
hy the Veterinary Staff
ASPCA Hospital and Clinic

Sk\in diseases in cats, much as in man,
often have bizarre underlying causes, such as
systemic allergies, contact dermatitis, fungus
infection, bacterial infections, hormonal im-
balance, parasites, ingestion of toxic sub-
stances or internal disorders. Compounding
the problem is the fact that these diseases
appear similar to the layman. Therefore a
veterinarian must diagnose the ailment be-
fore prescribing treatment. Patent medicines
or neighbors’ remedies may aggravate the
condition—or at least do nothing to help
it. Meantime the disease may advance to a
chronic stage where effective therapy be-
comes much more difﬁcult.

Ringworm

Ringworm is caused by a fungus that can
be transmitted to man and other animals.
Most common in young kittens, it may also
occur in older cats. It usually starts around
the face and ears. If allowed to progress it
may spread to any area of the body. Small
focal infections can usually be treated suc-
cessfully if handled carefully. A veterinarian
may treat the lesions with anti-fungal prepa-
rations, or he may suggest special shampoos
or dips. To treat the condition internally as
well as externally he may prescribe oral tab-
lets over a period of several weeks.

After treating an infected animal, wash
your hands thoroughly and disinfect the
premises. Since this is a matter of public
health, be extremely careful. If an abnormal
skin lesion occurs on a member of the house-

hold, consult a physician at once. If the cat
has an advanced case involving many areas
of the body, it is often better to have the
animal humanely destroyed, rather than risk
contagion to members of the household.

Eczema

Eczema is a general term applied to a
non-contagious skin disorder usually charac-
terized by focal hairlessness and small papules
or scabs. The animal will lick or bite the af-
fected areas. The condition is usually caused
by allergy, most frequently resulting from
sensitization from flea bite. Allergy may also
be caused by foods, pollen in the air, etc. The
animal’s history may give the veterinarian
a clue to the cause of the allergy. Basic treat-
ment involves eliminating the cause of the
allergy, then treating it with anti-allergy
drugs.

Alopecia (Hairlessness)

Hairlessness can be caused by focal infec-
tion or constant licking at a part irritated by
insect bites or other irritations. Symmetrical
hairlessness—an even distribution on both
sides of the body —-— may indicate an internal
disorder resulting from kidney disease or
hormonal imbalance such as thyroid dis-
orders, pituitary gland disorders, etc. The
ailment is most difficult to diagnose. A pro-
fessional examination is imperative.

External Parasites

Parasites such as ﬂeas and mites may in-
fest cats. Most commercial flea powders and
sprays are safe, provided the label speciﬁcally
states the preparation is for use on cats. Dust
the animal with the powder, comb out ten or
ﬁfteen minutes later with a ﬁne tooth comb
to remove dead or unconscious fleas. Launder
the cat’s bedding and vacuum the rugs and
furniture to rid the house of ﬂeas and eggs.

Mites are microscopic and most owners
can’t detect them. The most common are ear
mites. They infest the inner ear canal pri-
marily, but may also affect the outer ear ﬂap
and skin around the base of the ear. Com-
plications from secondary infections may re-
quire antibiotics or other specialized therapy.

How to adopt an animal

If you prefer a mixed breed, as many people do— just a fluffy ball of fur to
round out your family — the adoption procedure is even simpler. Animals for adoption
are available at all ASPCA shelters. Adoption Wards are open 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
daily, except Sundays and holidays.

There are many animals to choose from. But since our population is constantly
changing you may not ﬁnd just the right animal on your ﬁrst visit. If not, come back
as often as you like, or try one of the other shelters.

When you’ve made your selection, we’ll ask you a few questions, such as.

I Does the whole family want a pet? A house divided does not make a satis-

factory adoption.

I Is your house large enough? A two-room apartment with a large family leaves

no room for a big dog.

I Are you healthy enough and do you have the time to give a dog enough

exercise?

I Will the pet have companionship, or will it be left alone to howl or meow all

day? .

If we both agree that the adoption is suitable, you will be asked to sign a form
which stipulates, among other things, that if for some reason you can’t keep the pet,
you will return it to us.

Free examinations

Although we take every reasonable precaution to guard the health of the animal
you adopt, we can’t guarantee that it does not harbor a disease. So each adopted animal
is entitled to a free examination and one serum inoculation against communicable dis-
eases. We urge you to take advantage of this service at the ASPCA Hospital on the
day of adoption. But if that’s impossible, you may bring your pet in within one week
after adoption, any day, except Saturday, Sunday or a holiday. Regular hospital hours
are from 9 a.m. to 12 noon, and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. We also offer free advice and a
booklet on the care of your new pet.

Altering of adopted animals

To prevent the birth of unwanted puppies and kittens, we recommend that adopted
male and female cats and female dogs be altered. If the surgery is done in our
hospital, the Society will bear all hospital costs (except the surgical charge) up to
the time the doctor recommends that the animal be discharged. The costs which are
included free cover hospitalization, examination, entrance, drug and inoculation fees.

Application for the alteration surgery must be made within two weeks after
adoption. However, since some animals are too young for this surgery at the time

of adoption, we give owners four months after application in which to take advantage
of the service.

Contributions welcome

Free adoptions, free examinations and the spaying service are possible because
the adoption service is one of several ASPCA activities paid for by contributions. We
are always grateful to anyone giving a home to one of our orphans who makes a con-
tribution toward the care of others still unchosen. Otherwise, we could not afford the
extra effort we make to ﬁnd the right home for the right animal.

Last year our ambulances answered 81,130 calls for un-
wanted animals, an average of about 222 a day. Almost 50,000
animals were brought to the shelters by owners.

Of the 160,863 animals handled in our shelters last year
78 percent were put to sleep. While this may seem like a high
percentage, the fact is many of these unfortunate animals were
infill health or were too old to be accepted into new homes. The
principal reason for the high percentage, however, is that the
majority —— 94,225 —— were put to sleep at their owners’ request.
. The decompression method used is, in our opinion, the most
I humane, swift and painless available when dealing with num-

bers of animals.

  

Stray and abandoned animals

We constantly round up abandoned and homeless animals
on the streets. We are alert when new demolition projects are
announced. We post signs in the area requesting old tenants not
to abandon animals when they move. During the past year, for
instance, we have been rounding up strays in the Coney Island
area in Brooklyn, where there has been extensive demolition.

We will also lend a humane trap to anyone who wishes to
catch strays. We ask a $10 deposit for the trap, returnable when
the trap is returned. If any animals are trapped, we will call
for the animals and the trap at our regular $51 charge per call.

The Society participates actively on the Citizens Committee
to Keep New York City Clean, with special emphasis on picking
up stray animals in spotlighted problem areas.

Last year 33,583 stray and abandoned animals were rescued
from streets and buildings. We answer emergency calls any
time of day or night.

To the rescue

Several times a day, somewhere in the city a cat gets
stuck up a tree, or a dog is marooned down a manhole. A litter
of kittens is heard meowing behind a foot-thick wall, or a dog
is caught in a subway turnstile.

Armed with ladders, poles, axes and Chisels, our men
race to the rescue. Sometimes they break a wall, sometimes
they risk their lives climbing a 40-foot tree. With the gratui-
tous advice of the crowds that gather to watch, the animal is
freed and handed to a grateful owner or taken to the shelter.

Animal orphans
What happens to an animal whose owner goes to prison
or a hospital, or dies, and leaves no one to care for his pet?
ASPCA’s Medical Stray Ward, which last year cared for
2,601 animals, is the answer.
A recent case involved a six-month-old jaguar found in the
" "1. Bronx apartment of an unconscious woman. Suffering from an

The federal law

A federal humane slaughter law in effect since August 1960 applies only to meat
packers selling meat, either directly or indirectly, to the federal government. The
Department of Agriculture reports that during the ﬁrst full year the law was in
operation nearly 100 million animals were slaughtered humanely in over 480 federally
inspected establishments. While this law has accomplished much and covers 90 per-
cent of the meat purchased in the country, several thousand small packers do not sell
to the United States government and thus are not forced to install humane slaughter
methods unless covered by state laws.

In 1962 two more states passed humane slaughter laws, bringing the total to 14
states. These states are California, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oregon, Rhode Island, Wash-

ington and Wisconsin.

New York State must try again next year. The wheels are already rolling for an
intensive campaign in the 1963 legislature.

The James Hopkins Award

The ASPCA is attacking the problem of humane slaughter on two fronts. In one
assault, we are campaigning for compulsory legislation. At the same time we are
encouraging meat packers to switch voluntarily to humane slaughter methods by

offering an award for development and use of new means for humanely killing food
animals.

The award is the James Hopkins Award, made possible by a trust fund left to the
Society by the late James Hopkins, who designated that it be used speciﬁcally to
recognize outstanding improvements in humane slaughter methods. The sterling silver
plaque and cash award have been presented ﬁve times.

The ﬁrst award went to meat packer George A. Hormel in 1953 for adopting a
process for anesthetizing hogs before slaughter. The hogs were carried through a
tunnel ﬁlled with carbon dioxide which rendered them unconscious in seconds. This
was the ﬁrst active step in introducing humane slaughter to this country. Certain sys-
tems had been in use in EurOpe and elsewhere as early as 1873, but because of the

enormous numbers of animals that had to be slaughtered for American appetites, they
were impractical for use here.

The Hormel “sleep tunnel” marked a sharp contrast to the old way in which h0g8,
sheep, lambs and calves were shackled and hoisted by one leg, frequently to be stuck,
scalded and skinned while still conscious. Cattle were rendered unconscious by repeated
blows on the head with a sledge hammer. Sometimes a dozen blows were necessary to

put the animal out of its misery. Injuries to workers were frequent, and animals were
bruised and battered.

In addition to providing a humane death for thousands of hogs, the Hormel method
gamed manifold beneﬁts for the packers as well. It speeded up operation, reduced
wasteful bruises in animals and proved safer for plant workers. Manufacturers and

inventors began to develop other systems, and packing companies were soon converting.

But until there is a law in every state making humane slaughter mandatory, many

packers refuse to adopt these methods voluntarily, and millions of animals will endure
needless suffering.

ew York’s finest

 

New York’s old retired police horses never
had it so good. For years they pounded hot
pavements, bucked trafﬁc and hustled for a
living in the big city. Now they’ve been put
out to pasture—and what a pasture. The
country club for this horsey set is a 166-
acre farm in Otisville, N. Y., operated by
the New York City Health Department’s
Bureau of Laboratories.

When years of quelling riots, herding
pedestrians and directing trafﬁc have taken
their toll, aged and ailing veterans of the
city’s Mounted Division retire to the nearest
thing to horse heaven. Their social security
provides for a big ﬁeldstone barn, plenty of
grass to roll in, a balanced diet of grain, an
extra treat of carrots, apples and sugar and
the best of veterinary care.

They share the farm with about 100
sheep, three monkeys, goats, turkeys, geese,
ducks, chickens, rabbits and guinea pigs. All
are used for research in serums and viruses
such as the polio virus which effects humans,
and feline enteritis, canine distemper and
infectious equine abortion in animals.

The horses serve as blood donors. About
once a month they’re tapped for a very small
blood sample for bacterial and tissue cul-
tures. The horses are not aﬁ‘ected in any
way. In fact, many live for ten years or more
in retirement.

Fifty-one horses were lolling in the shade
of the old apple trees on a recent Sunday
afternoon. Most were at least 20 years old.
“They’re walking on grass for the ﬁrst time
in their lives,” said Dr. Elizabeth Kraft.
Assistant Director of the Bureau of Labor-
atories, and in charge of the Otisville farm.
“They’ve worked eight hours a day for 12
or 15 years, and all this leisure takes getting
used to.”

Newcomers are given two weeks to be-
come oriented, and to make certain they are
free from communicable disease before they
are allowed to join the old timers. “Once
they join the crowd, they soon learn who the
boss is,” Dr. Kraft said. “One or two horses

children from the Federation of the Handicapped, foster children from P5. 110 and
emotionally disturbed youngsters from the League School.

Girl Scout project

During the year we started a program to help Senior Girl Scouts working on
Animal Care and First Aid Badges. ASPCA veterinarians are teaching these enthusi-
astic youngsters care of pets, simple ﬁrst aid and proper feeding.

The Society is proud of the recognition we received this year when the Girl

Scouts of America presented us with their Golden Anniversary plaque for our work
with the youth of New York City.

Pet shows

More and more New York youth organizations are realizing the social value of
encouraging a child’s interest in a pet. The result is that pet shows are becoming a
popular youth organization activity. Last year the ASPCA sponsored or assisted 67
shows, often acting as judges and presenting awards for the best-cared-for pets.

Literature and ﬁlms

F ifty-nine thousand pieces of educational literature were distributed last year——
free to public schools and at cost to the general public. Many of the booklets, ranging
in price from 5¢ to 35¢, were written by the staff. A list is available on request.

Among the most frequently requested booklets are That New Puppy, Your Dog
and His Care, and Cats and Their Care. The last two are given free to people who
adopt animals fro-m the ASPCA. The cat booklet was completely revised this year.

A series of bookmarks with information on care of the dog, turtle, cat, hamster,
guinea pig, horse, mice, rat, rabbit, ﬁsh and parakeet is available.

Last year more than 500 schools, pet clubs, civic groups and other humane
societies showed our ﬁlms and asked for our recommendations on motion pictures and
ﬁlmstrips on animals.

Public appearances

Our staff gives lectures and demonstrations on animal care on radio, television
and in schools, children’s organizations and the New York Public Library. Last year
there were 39 such appearances.
