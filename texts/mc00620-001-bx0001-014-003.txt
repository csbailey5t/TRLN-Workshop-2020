Let us learn to love and protect the birds and their nests.

Birds are man’s helpers.

Let us protect the cats and dogs from ill treatment, give them food and
water and a warm place to sleep in. They like a gentle touch and kind words.

Please do notlet your dog run under a cart or after a bicycle. He will
soon become exhausted. Many dogs are killed, many lost, many are made very
ill by following bicycles and electric cars.

Please make your horse comfortable. Do not use the overhead check or
any tight check reins. Never jerk, kick, whip, overload or overwork him.

Please be gentle with your cattle, never frighten them or give them pain
by dogging them, or other cruel usage.

Please do not ﬁsh or hunt for sport or use steel or other cruel traps.

Try never to cause needless pain to any living creature.

Do nothing to hurt the feelings of anyone.

Do all you can to make others happy.

When you see any creature abused, please earnestly but kindly protest
against such abuse.

Remember the Golden Rule.

Try to treat every living creature as you would like to be treated if you
were that creature.

Be above using profane or vulgar language.

Be clean in body and mind

These are the ways to be happy and loved. W
