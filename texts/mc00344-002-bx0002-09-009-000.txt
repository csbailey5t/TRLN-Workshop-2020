Dear Mr. Hofer:

Thank you for your letter in which you express your
opposition to any weakening of the Marine Mammal Protection
Act of 1972. It is a pleasure to hear from you.

Many constituents have contacted me regarding
the hearings being held by Congressman Leggett and the
Fisheries Subcommittee relative to the tuna/porpoise
situation. I have been advised that these hearings.
are solely for oversight purposes and no legislation
to modify the Marine Mammal Protection Act is expected
to result from the Subcommittee proceedings.

However you are correct in that there is support
within Congress to weaken the Act as it applies to the
tuna industry I was a proponent of the Marine Mammal
Protection Act and 1 can assure you of my reluctance to
endorse any leglslatlon or Congressiona1 efforts wh1ch
wou1dW prevent 1ts 1ntent from b61ng fully real1zed

1 Thank you again for wr1t1ng, and please extend
my best regards to your wife.

Sincerely,

William D/ Hathaway
United Swates Senator

Mr. Theodore Hofer

Dear Mr. Hofer:

Thank you for advising me of your support for H.R. 5808,
the Animal Welfare Act Amendments. The language of this bill was,
as you know, incorporated in S. 1941, a bill which recently cleared
the House.

The House version of S. 1941 differs from the Senate version
only with respect to the amendment making it illegal to breed,
possess, ship or move game fowl and other animals in interstate
commerce when this is done for the purpose of fighting.

Because the Senate-approved version of S. 1941 contained no
provision pertaining to game fowl, the full Senate will soon vote so

as to decide whether to accept the House amendment or send the bill
to a conference committee to resolve the difference.

It is difficult to predict with certainty‘how the Committee of
Conference might resolve this issue should House and Senate disagree-
ment require such a conference. But in the event that the Senate has
the opportunity to vote on the game fowl amendment, I shall vote to
support it along With the bill which it amends. ‘“

It is good to hear from you. Please keep me informed of your
views from time to time.

Sincerely,

73%!

Dear Mr. Hofer:

Thank you for your letter urging that legislation be enacted
to provide for the protection of whales.

I share your interest in the preservation of whales and all
endangered species. The trade bill, however, contains no provision
dealing with the protection of whales and since I am generally
Opposed to tying our trade policies to the internal policies of the
countries with which we trade, I would be inclined to oppose such a
proposal. I believe we should continue our efforts through diplo-
matic channels to secure international treaty agreements with Japan
and Russia on the question. Senator Magnuson, Chairman of the

Senate Commerce Committee, recently introduced a joint resolution
calling upon the Secretaries of State and Commerce to respond to the
issue with all the authority that domestic law and international
agreements place at their command. The bill is presenty pending
before the Commerce Committee and I shall continue to watch develop-
ments closely. '

As you may know, H.R. ll873 was passed by the House on
February 7 and is presently pending before the Senate Agriculture
Committee. The Committee is scheduled to take to take the measure,
along with its own animal health research bill, under consideration
in executive session this week. You may be assured that I shall
give careful study to bill as reported by the Committee, keeping
your views and interest in mind.

Thank you again for communicating your views to me.

Sincerely,
