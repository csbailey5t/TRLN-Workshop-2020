1. INTRODUCTION

This short paper was prepared for submission to the 43rd annual meeting of the
International Whaling Commission (IWC). Parts 1-1 through 1-5 are meant to orient

‘ readers who will see this report for the ﬁrst time without knowledge of the relationship

between the author and the whaling issue, while readers informed on the whalingissue
will save time by beginning with part 1-6.

An English-language summary of this report has been prepared and submitted to the
International Whaling Commission, as well as to international organizations, press
afﬁliates, research institutes, universities, and other bodies concerned with the
whaling issue.

1-1. Annual IWC Meetings (4lst and 42nd)

In 1990 and 1991 I attended the 4lst annual meeting of the IWC (San Diego, USA) and
the 42nd (Noordwijk, Netherlands) as a representative of an NGO (the Elsa Nature
Conservancy).

Prior to the 4lst meeting the ElsaNature Conservancy performed a study on the small-

. type coastal whaling base of Ayukawa in Miyagi Prefecture and submitted the report
. (“An Investigation of Small-Type Whaling in Japan - The Past, Present and Future of
Ayukawa,” ABE Osamu, 1989) to the IWC. This report proved, on the basis of an on-
site study, that Japan’s largest small-type coastal whalingbase in Ayukawa was a kind

of commercial whaling and could notbe termed what is known as “traditional whaling.”
Apparently this report incurred the wrath of the Japanese government, the reason
being that at the 41st meeting the Japanese delegate continued to persistently assert
that Japan’s small-type coastal whaling is an important cultural asset which sustains
the tradition of the Japanese ethnic culture, and that it must be preserved at all costs.
.Additionally, a representative of the Ayukawa Whalers attended this meeting and
displayed conspicuous antagonism toward me. Although this was anticipated to a

degree, I must honestly say that I was quite shocked by the Japanese government’s

assertion of the necessity of small- -type coastal whaling, because time and time again
the delegate implied that all Japanese are dependent for their livelihood upon coastal
whaling, and that if it Were discontinued this would mean the utter destruction of the
ethnic culture ,traditions, the economy, and yea, even the religious life of the J apanesew

1-2. My Relationship with the Whaling Issue

Though my relationship with the whaling issue began in 197 3, I had not attended an
IWC meeting until 1990. The reason is simply that I could not afford the time and
travel expenses needed to attend. However, despite the impossibility of attending the
meetings, I was able to ascertain the trends in the whaling issue from the information
I gathered. Thus it was that for my ﬁrst attendance at an IWC meetingI took up the
matter of Ayukawa because of my decision to treat one of the smallest Issues, which
fell within the scope of the time and ﬁnancial resources available to me. As noted above,

Ayukawa 18 said to be the largest of the small- -type coastal whallng bases still existing
in Japan, but we were of the belief that small- -type coastal whaling itself was, among
the whaling 1ssues Japan faced, a small 1ssue with the least signiﬁcance. However, the
impression I received when attending the 41st annual IWC meeting was that this

 

 




 

might apparently not be so. Still, I believed that a problem with larger signiﬁcance is
the scientiﬁc whaling that Japan forcibly pursues in spite of so many protests, as well
as the IWC’s reiterated resolutions of criticism.

Thus it was thatI attended the 42nd annual IWC meeting and submitted a report that
examined Japan’s survey whaling (“Japan’s Scientiﬁc Whaling - A Recommendation
to Pull Out Entirely,” FUJIWARA Eiji, 1990). Apparently this report elicited the
antipathy of the Japanese government more than I had anticipated, the reason being
that when this report was published in the June issue of the prestigious monthly
magazine Sekai (published by Iwanami Shoten) Japanese government representatives
(from the Fisheries Agency) were incensed and lodged a vociferous protest with the
publisher. Although such a reaction had been partly anticipated, I was not only
surprised , but also somewhat astonished when I learned that several Fisheries Agency
personnel had thrust themselves into the publisher’s ofﬁces. This was because the
heart of their contention was that the distinguished British science magazine Nature
had recognized the justiﬁability of Japan’s scientiﬁc whaling. However, their argument
was full of holes, and Nature subsequently published another article, by an IWC
committee member from another country, which refuted the ﬁrst. I would like to touch
upon that at another opportunity.

1-3. The Reason for Choosing Abashiri

At the 42nd annual meeting the Japanese delegate again advocated the continuance
of small-type coastal whaling, but just as before, this sounded all too bizarre to me, a
Japanese. In spite of our aforementioned report, which demonstrated that Ayukawa
whaling is not traditional whaling, what could possibly be the meaning of the
statements by the Japanese delegate, who stubbornly insisted as before that Japan’s
small-type coastal whaling (STCVV) is absolutely necessary? NGO participants from
other countries in attendance at the meeting were at a loss to divine Japan’s true
intention. Time and time again, a number of NGO members from other countries asked
me, “Why is Japan so unyielding?” I did not have a good understanding of the reason,
but at that time I thought that, just maybe, the grounds for the Japanese government’s
insistence upon the justiﬁability of Japan’s small-type coastal whaling pertain to a
base other than that at Ayukawa. The primary candidate for such a possibility is Taiji
in Wakayama Prefecture, but it had been previously surveyed, and we were conﬁdent
that the government cOuld not claim a loss of livelihood without coastal whaling. Here
I felt the necessity to survey Abashiri in Hokkaido as a remote location which might
be conceived as one that could not survive without whaling.

1-4. Preliminary Survey and the Gulf War

Abashiri was known as the only small-type coastal whaling base remaining in the
Hokkaido area, but I had not had occasion to visit it. If in this place small-type coastal
whaling exists as the main industry and underpinning of the people’s livelihood in area
settlements, this would mean there is an element of truth in the Japanese government
delegate’s claim, and by writing a report on Abashiri’s whaling, my own way of dealing
with the IWC might also change somewhat.

Thus it was that in 1990 after returning from The Netherlands and concluding a
speaking tour of South Korea, I carried out a preliminary survey of Abashiri over
approximately one week in mid-October, before the snows came. Then, for a

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

comparative study with a foreign whaling base, I spent the last part of November and
early December in Augusta, a whaling base in southwest Australia.

The plan was to perform the main survey at Abashiri this year (1991) on the basis of
the previous surveys, but all plans were cancelled by the Gulf war in the Middle East,
which broke out on January 17, 1991. The depredations of war that rolled over the Gulf
coast brought severe destruction to the area; the war showed signs of expanding, and
was moving in the direction of escalation to a new world war that would include the
use of nuclear weapons. Stopping the war became a matter of the most urgent priority,
and a great deal of effort and money were dedicated to petitioning, to structuring an
argument for an end to the war, and to writing activities.

For this reason the Abashiri issue was put on the back burner at the institute, and the
Gulf war temporarily consigned the whaling war to oblivion.

1-5. Participation in Writing

Thus it is that having expended to the maximum our funding, time, and energy on the
war, we must give up attending this year’s annual IWC meeting. To be honest, we were
hoping that ripples from the Gulf war would bring about the cancellation of this year’s
meeting, but upon hearing the news that the whaling war would be conducted on
schedule at Reykjavik in Iceland, we decided to hurriedly prepare a short report and
participate in writing.

While this report is therefore based on a short-term preliminary survey, the main
survey to be performed in the future will probably not overturn the conclusion of this
report, which follows herein. This is because Abashiri at present has undergone quite
signiﬁcant changes.

1-6. Summary of Conclusion

Small-scale coastal whaling in Abashiri has for all practical purposes disappeared.
Even the locals have but a very weak sense that such whaling is a cultural tradition
which should be preserved, and there is also little basis to contend that the process by
which this whaling came into existence and then disappeared is a cultural tradition.
Such being the case, it would not seem that whaling constitutes an economic, cultural,
or traditional foundation that affects the existence of Abashiri City or-the every day
lives of its citizens.

What is more, because Abashiri’s whaling is a source of pollution that causes yet
another kind of marine resource depletion over a broad area —- the over-fishing by
coastal small-scale whaling — it seems desirable that, in addition to wholly shutting
down the whaling operation, the whale meat market should be completely closed, and
the Whalers should shiftto the development of a new whale watching industry.

 

 

 




 

2. ABASHIRI .

2-1. Geographical Position, Natural Features, and Climate

Abashiri City is located in the northeastern part of Hokkaido at the mouth of the
Abashiri River, facing the Sea of Okhotsk. It has an area of 471.2km2, and the total
length of the city’s coastline is 34.2km. Two lakes, Lake Mokoto and Lake Tofutsu, lie
along the coast of the eastern part of Abashiri, making for an extended low-lying
wetland which is a tourist attraction known for the Koshimizu Natural Floral Garden.
This area extends further east to Shari and Shiretoko.

The southern part of the city is hilly with residential districts in the high areas. To the
south are Lake Abashiri and Lake Notoro, and the region around the lakes is Abashiri
Quasi-National Park. The hills in the east are the Mokoto Highlands, in the west are
the Tokoro Hills, in the south are the Shiomi Heights, and in the southeast is Mt. Tento,
from which one can see Abashiri Port far below.

The average annual temperature is 5.8°C, and there is little dense fog, with many clear
days. Abashiri receives-about 700 mm of rain annually, which is low for Hokkaido.
During the winter, from January to March, drift ice comes to shore along the coast of
the Sea of Okhotsk, bringing ﬁshing operations to a halt.

2-2. Access to Abashiri
2—2-1. Railways

There are two train lines-the Sekihoku Line that joins Abashiri and Asahikawa City,
and the Senmo Line that joins Abashiri and Kushiro. The former line takes one to
Abashiri from Sapporo in 5 hours and 20 minutes, running ﬁve trains a day, while the
latter runs four trains each day, taking passengers between Abashiri and Kushiro in
3 hours and 40 minutes.

2-2-2. Roads

Seven paved national highways run into Abashiri City, in addition to which four other
paved roads join the airport, the park, and Abashiri City. Using these roads one can
travel the 17km to Memanbetsu, the airport site, in 20 minutes. It is 194km (3 hours
and 50 minutes) to Obihiro; 151km (approximately 3 hours) to Kushiro; and 352km
(about 6 hours and 30 minutes) to Sapporo.

2-2-3. Air Travel and Ferries

It is about 50 minutes by air to Tokyo, with three ﬂights each day, and about 45 minutes
to Sapporo, with four flights a day. There are also ferries from Kushiro to Honshu.
Thus, Abashiri is well connected to other highly developed parts of Japan.

2-2-4. A Trip to Abashiri, and First Impressions

I took a bus and train to Tokyo from Tsukuba Science City in Ibaraki Prefecture, and
from Tokyo I ﬂew to Memanbetsu Airport, where one can rent a car, then proceeded

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

to my lodgings in Abashiri. The net time required for this trip was 7 hours. While it
was amazing that only 1 hour was required from Tokyo’s Haneda Airport, I also
observed that Abashiri is undergoing the same kind of urbanization being carried out
in Tokyo’s suburban communities. Ab ashiri City’s business and entertainment district
along South Fourth Avenue is now a completely urbanized mall.

According to the assertion of the Japanese delegation to the International Whaling
Commission, it is as if the citizens of Abashiri will starve tomorrow if the city does not
depend upon its small-scale coastal whaling, but my ﬁrst impression upon seeing the
city —— and a very strong impression it was — is that the government’s assertion is
exceedingly exaggerated. This is also proved by ﬁgures on population and the
proportion of the employed population, showing the percentages of people engaged in
the ﬁsheries industry.

However, assuming that Abashiri is dependent upon whaling, what I had looked
forward to more than anything else was seeing exactly how and in what way of thinking
this city — which looks just like any of the suburban cities near Tokyo — is dependent
upon the whaling industry. Considering the extent to which the Japanese government
raises its voice at international conferences to insist that small-scale coastal whaling
is absolutely essential for the preservation of Japan’s local cultural traditions,
economies, and religion, I had gotten my hopes up over making a great many
’discoveries that would substantiate the government’s assertions.

' If, in this country of Japan, which is now known as one of the world’s great economic
powers, I were able to discover a local community that could not survive without
whaling, this might be quite sensational.

2-3. The City and How It Was Established

North of the Abashiri River mouth there is a historical site called the Moyoro Shell
Mounds, and archaeological remains left by the native peoples who established the
Okhotsk culture. These people are not the modern Japanese, but those known in
archeology as the Moyoro Shell Mound People. It is said that the shell mound people
were a race that resembled the Aleuts and the peoples of northern Asia.

In the sixth year 'of the Tenmei Era (1786) meeting places and transport businesses
were established here, and the area became a base for ﬁsheries. In the 12th year of
the Meiji Era (1879) the Abashiri County Ofﬁce was established, and in the 30th year
(1897) the Abashiri Prefectural Branch Ofﬁce was opened.

The town developed along the Abashiri River, and now the city extends to Okuma in
the west to Abashiri Port in the east, with Abashiri Station on the Sekihoku Line in
the approximate center. Many modern buildings line the city’s streets. A great numb er
of new housing developments have appeared in the hilly areas and on the heights along
the sea coast, which was all to my great surprise. I had expected to see avillage of crude
shacks like the one I had visited on a survey to the Alaskan Eskimo whaling site at
Barrow. Abashiri is a modern city differing radically from the conception of a poor
village or ﬁshing settlement in the north country. '

2-4. Populations and Whaling ouseholds

The total 1987 population of Abashiri'City is 43,250, of which 21,253 are males, and
21,997 are females. There were 15,565 households (at the end of September, and ,
according to the register of residents), and a look at the secular change from 1960 shows
that the population at that time — 44,052 — was only slightly larger than that of 1987.
The population reached its apogee in 1972 at 48,757, after which it began to decline,
and it was between 43,000 and 44,000 during the subsequent 15 years.

According to the “Petition for the Preservation of Subsistence Whaling” submitted to
the Abashiri City Council by the city’s two whaling companies in December of 1987,
there are 103 people and 25 households in Abashiri that make their living by whaling.
These ﬁgures represent 0.16 percent of the city’s total households, or about 0.24
percent of the total city population. Although the petition states that a moratorium
on whaling would have incalculable effects when including the people working in
related industries such as processing and sales (Abashiri Shimbun, Dec. 18, 1987), one
can obtain a fairly good idea of the actual situation from the number of people employed
by industry, and income amounts according to type of industry.

2-5. Changes in Relative Importance of Industries as Indicated by Number
of Employed People

There were 21,202 employed people in Abashiri in 1985, which accounts for 0.8 percent
of the total 2,625,352 employed people for Hokkaido as a whole. Although this applies
to the entire prefecture, in Abashiri fewer and fewer people are employed in the
primary industries, while the number of people working in the tertiary industries is
on the increase. To be speciﬁc, the number of people working in the primary industries
in 1985 was 3,142, accounting for 14.8 percent of the working population, while people
employed in the tertiary industries numbered 13,530, or 63.8 percent of the working
population. Fisheries is, of course, a primary industry, and for the same year there
were 1,058 people, or 5 percent of the population, employed here. Needless to say, these
people were employed in ﬁsheries as a whole, which includes the local industries of
scallops, herring, flatﬁsh, and shrimp.

Changes in the number of employed people according to industry were as follows in the
Comparatively recent years of 1970 to 1985. The primary industries employed 4,589
people in 1970 (22.1 percent of the working population), but ﬁve years later, in 1975,
the number was 3,393 (16.7 percent). Five years subsequent to that, in 1980, the
number dropped to 3,248 (14.9 percent), and the decrease continued to 3,142 in 1985
(14.8 percent). This decrease at the same time means an increase in the number of
people employed in the tertiary industries, and indicates that the lifestyle of Abashiri’s
citizens has been undergoing rapid urbanization.

2-6. Income (in yen) by Industry

A look at incomes in Abashiri City by industry attributable to net production shows
that in 1984 the total income derived from the primary industries of agriculture,
forestry, and ﬁsheries was 9,196,752,000, of which ﬁsheries accounted for 4,413,653,000.
Income in the secondary industries was 16,108,117,000, and the total income for the
tertiary industries was 53,512,239,000. The proportion of the total accounted for by
ﬁsheries is a mere 5.6 percent. '

 

 

 

 

 




3. HISTORY OF ABASHIRI WHALING
3-1. 'The Beginnings of Abashiri’s Whaling

Abashiri’s whaling began in July 1915 when the Toyo Whaling Company established
a place of business at Tanneshira on the Futatsuiwa Coast, and brought whaling
vessels there on August 12. On the night of August 15 the company is said to have
brought in its first whale, a ﬁn whale 267 shaku (20.3m) in length, and began flensing
operations at 4 am. on the next morning of August 16. The whaling vessel used on this
occasion was a small steamer displacing 120- 130 tons, which was a rare sight at this
time when the principal means of transportation was the horse. A whale over 20m in
length was also rare, and accounts say that every day great numbers of people came
from as far away as Notsukeushi and Bihoro to see it.

 

 

3-2. The Toyo Whaling Company

In 1899, Mr. OKA Juro from Yamaguchi Prefecture and Mr. YAMADA Tosaku
established the Japan Deep Sea Fishing Company with 100,000 yen in capital in
Senzaki on the Sea of Japan coast. In 1903 this company increased its capital by
500,000 yen, and changed its name to Toyo Fishing. It operated mainly in the area
offshore of the Korean peninsula, but gradually expanded into the Paciﬁc side of J apan,
and in 1906 the company moved into the areas offshore of Kochi and Wakayama
Prefectures, and Kinkazan in Miyagi Prefecture. During this period of time whaling
companies were founded one after another, attaining 12 in number, and the number
of whaling vessels grew to 28.

The progressive amalgamation of the largest of these whaling companies, Dainihon
Whaling, Teikoku Marine Products, Nagasaki Whaling, and Toyo Fishing, resulting
in the establishment of a new whaling company, Toyo Whaling, with capital of 7 million
yen and 17 vessels. Mr. OKA worked for this new company, the main ofﬁce of which
was moved to Osaka. These events happened in 1909.

 

3-3. - Mr. OKA Juro and Toyo Whaling

Mr. OKA was born in Yamaguchi Prefecture in 1870, graduated from Keio Gijuku, and
became a prefectural assembly member in Yamaguchi. But he gave his attention to
whaling upon the recommend , ion of FUKUZAWA Yukichi, the founder and the ﬁrst
president of Keio University KA went to Norway himself, studied whaling as it was
conducted there, and then returned to Japan. He built the 122 ton metal-hulled
whaling ship Nagaoka-Maru and began, for the ﬁrst time in Japan, modern Norwegian- 3;
style whaling whose objective was the hunting of large whales. A noteworthy fact here I
is that OKA Juro’s Toyo Whaling Company conducted operations based on modern
capital and modern whaling. techniques, which differed completely from Japan’s .
traditional method of whalingfhat flourished in places like Taiji, Wakayama Prefecture,
Murotsu in Kochi Prefecture, and Ikitsuki Island in Kyushu.

 

3-4. Abashiri Whaling as Conducted by Toyo Whaling .

In other words, whaling in Abashiri did notbegin as subsistence whaling by which local . V;
people made their living, but was from the very outset, commercial whaling conducted i /

 

 

 

 




f

‘3
; by outside people who brought their own large capital with them. What is more,

whaling at this time was conducted not only at Abashiri, for they also went to the off-
shore waters along the Korean peninsula, which was the area in which Toyo Whaling
operated at the time it was ﬁrst established. And in the next year of 19 18 [see reference
at end of paper] or 1920 the company decided to move the bulk of its operations to the
region of Nemuro in southern Hokkaido, and whaling at Ab ashiri was suspended until
1930. This tells us that whaling at Abashiri was commercial whaling whose raison
Eiéjd’etre was the pursuit of proﬁt.

3-5. The Death of OKA Juro, and Japanese Whaling

OKA Juro died in Osaka in 1923, and in 1934 Toyo Whaling was merged with Japan
Industries, a company run by a man from Yamaguchi Prefecture, AYUKAWA
Yoshisuke, at which time Toyo’s name was changed to Japan Whaling. According to
one source, Japan Whaling began whaling operations at Abashiri in 1931, but
assuming that the previously stated 1934 is correct, it was Toyo Hogei that resumed
operations in 1931.

Regardless of the year, the suspended whaling operations at Abashiri were resumed,
but these operations were once again suspended in 1935 due to a precipitous decline
in the number of whales taken. In the next year, 1936, Japan Whaling merged with
the Joint Fisheries Company, an operation of Japan Industries, and its name was
changed in 1937 to Japan Marine Products.

 

 

The whaling at Ab ashiri, which thus underwent repeated suspensions and resum ptions,
1 was modern commercial whaling run by capital from outside Abashiri.

3-6. Resumption of Whaling by Nissui, and the Establishment of a Presence
by Tosa Whaling

After Japan Whaling had suspended operations in 1935, Tosa Whaling, Ltd. moved
into Abashiri. The China Incident began in 1937, and the Second World War in 1939.
This created a need to increase the production of meat and leather, and in 1940 Japan
Marine Products started whaling for the third time at Abashiri. Historical events
proceeded to the outbreak of the Paciﬁc War in 1941, and whaling in the Sea of ‘Okhotsk
flourished. The large whaling companies from Honshu came to Abashiri one after the
other, until in 1950 there were seven companies operating there.

3-7. The Appearance of Miyoshi Whaling Company and Shimomichi Marine
Products Company

In 1945 the Paciﬁc War concluded. In 1953 Miyoshi Whaling began operating, and 16
~”years after that, in 1969, Shimomichi Marine Products also began whaling. Both of
N“ these companies were operated by local business interests, and it was therefore on this
occasion that something actually like family-operated subsistence whaling made its
appearance here.

3-8. The Venture Business Fiasco

Since these two companies now constitute the principal basis for the advocacy of
Abashiri’s traditional subsistence whaling, such whaling cannot be regarded as

; x.

cultural tradition and the right of survival; is going too far no matter how one looks at
the situation. It is probably best to see the business crisis these two companies now
face as an example of companies being forced willy-nilly into either shutting down or
switching to a different business due to the resource competition inherent in modern
capitalism. This is something that happened to a kind of venture business that arose
all over postwar Japan.

4. ABASHIRI’S FISHERIES INDUSTRY AND WHALING

4-1. Marine Life Caught by the Fisheries Industry

Abashiri’s ﬁsheries industry ﬁshes for the following types of marine life — herring,
salmon, trout, cod, walleye pollack, arabesque greenling, paciﬁc saury, brown sole,
korean ﬂounder, longsnout ﬂounder, pointhead ﬂounder, red halibut, cresthead
ﬂounder, and other types of ﬂatﬁsh, menuke, bighand thornyhead, other kinds of ﬁsh,
paciﬁc ﬂying squid, mizudako, yanagidako, king crab, kegani, hanasakigani, other
types of crabs, ezobafun’uni, prawn, other kinds of shrimp, scallops, sakhalin sarf-

clam, tsubu, other kinds of shellﬁsh, kelp and other kinds of seaweed, minke whales,
and Baird’s beaked whale.

As well, Abashiri’s ﬁshing industry takes the following ﬁsh from the local lakes —
wakasagi, carp, crucian, goby ﬁsh, striped mullet, yamatoshijimi, threespine stickleback,
kurihaze, japanese iceﬁsh, japanese huchen, kawagarei, saffron cod, asa, and toothed
smelt.

Because some of the lakes around Abashiri are connected with the sea and are
brackish, and because there are brackish areas in the mouths of rivers, one ﬁnds among
freshwater species some ocean species such as goby ﬁsh and mullet. It is for this reason
that the scallops listed above among marine species are produced in brackish lakes.

4-2. Fishing Methods Used by the Abashiri Fisheries Industry

Roughly categorized, there are ﬁve types of ﬁshing, but breaking those ﬁve types down
further yields the following:

4-2-1. Stationary Fishing Methods
Stationary salmon ﬁshing

4-2-2. Fisheries Needing the Authorization of the Minister of Agriculture,
Forestr and Fisheries

4-3. Whaling as Seen from the Fishing Methods upon which Abashiri’s

Fisheries Industry Depends, and the Size of the Fishing Catch

The above detailed list of the types of ﬁshing conducted at Abashiri was meant to show
that whaling is not the only kind of ﬁshery there. Among the diverse kinds of operations
shown above, that which has both the largest catch and the largest amount in terms
of money, is offshore drag netting. It has maintained this number one position for the
long period of 12 years, from 1975 to 1987.

On the other hand, a look at the position of small-scale whaling shows that, among all
37 kinds of ﬁshing, it has changed little from 14th place in 1975 to 1 1th place 12 years
later in 1987.

Fourteenth place and 11th place among a total of 37 types of ﬁshing are rankings in
the upper half, but since the leading type of ﬁshing has an especially high volume, it

 

10

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

would be hasty to assume that Abashiri is highly dependent on whaling on the basis
of this position alone. This is evident from the following proportions.

The total catch in 1975 by the type of ﬁshing with the highest catch (i.e. offshore
dragnetting) was 122,228 tons, and the total for whaling during this same year was
72 tons, meaning that whaling production was a mere 0.0589 percent that of offshore
dragnetting. A look at these two catch volumes as their proportions of the total
ﬁsheries production for that year shows that the volume offshore dragnet ﬁshing
accounted for 91.1 percent of total production, while the production of whaling was
0.0537 percent. In passing, the ﬁgures for both types of ﬁshing in 1987 were 72.79
percent for offshore dragnetting, and 0.4937 for whaling, indicating a rise on the part
of whaling. This appears to be a relative increase owing to the fact that in 1987 the total
catch for Abashiri’s ﬁsheries industry fell to less than half that of 197 5.

This is a matter that involves the decrease in Abashiri’s population, the decrease in
marine products, and the problem of the 200-nautical-mile exclusive ﬁshing zone. But
one cannot say that, because of this, Abashiri is to a degree traditionally dependent
upon whaling for its existence. The reason is that in 1975 the proportion of Abashiri’s
total ﬁsheries production accounted for by whaling was, as stated above, a mere 0.05
percent, or so. Fig. 5 (5-5) shows the proportions for each of the years from 1975 to 1987,
but in consulting the ﬁgures in this table it is necessary to keep the foregoing
explanation in mind.

4-4. Dependence upon Abashiri’s Whaling Companies as Seen from the Number
of Marine Products-Related Business Establishments

Two companies still carry on whaling in Abashiri, but the number of ﬁsheries
enterprises that combine both the sea and inland waters was 194 in 1986, and the
proportion of this total accounted for by these two whaling companies was 1.03 percent.

 

Additionally, the ﬁsheries industry automatically includes the industries that process
its catch. And in addition to processing, there are distribution, fueling, material sales,
shipbuilding, refrigeration and freezing, and other businesses, so that including these
makes for a total of 404 businesses, of which the two whaling companies account for
0.5 percent.

“i Compared with the total number of business establishments in Abashiri - 3,137 - the
city’s dependence upon the marine products industry is indicated by the 194 ﬁsheries
businesses that account for 9.37 percent of the total, while the two whaling companies
account for a mere 0.06 percent.

Thus it would be impossible to say that the shutdown of whaling at Abashiri would
have an effect on the city’s existence. .

5. ABASHTRI’S WHALIN G AND POLLUTION
1

5-1. The Two Companies’ Whaling-Related Equipment, Facilities, and
Processing Capacity

The two companies spoken of here are Miyoshi Whaling and Shimomichi Marine
Products. Even now these companies remain in Abashiri to conduct whaling for proﬁt,
while there are no other entities in Hokkaido that conduct whaling as commercial
ﬁrms. Thus, in our consideration of small-scale coastal whaling in Hokkaido, it is these
two companies that constitute the object of our investigation.

According to Abashiri City records from 1981, these two companies have the following
whaling-related equipment and facilities.

5-1-1. Equipment (Whaling Vessels)

Shimomichi Marine Products 600m2 200m2 (including rooftop - 77m2)

5-1-2-3. Discharging Ports for Whale Portions PrOcessed on Board

When ﬂensing whales on land, companies require the permission of the Fisheries
Minister. There are ﬁve such places in Hokkaido-Abashiri, Monbetsu, Kushiro,
Shibetsu, and Hab oro. However, the two companies in Abashiri use no other locations.

5-1-2-4. Whale Processing Capacity

Almost all flensing and processing of captured whales is performed manually. Three
to ﬁve persons are needed to work on each whale, and it takes about one day to flense
and process one minke whale.

5-2. Flensing Method

After taking a whale, the carcass is towed to the processing site at port, and pulled up
into the facility via the slipway (which has a slope of generally less than 20 percent).

 

12

 

 

 




 

_ l .
The whale is cut up into large sections, divided into the parts that will become whale
products and those that will be discarded. Then the large parts destined to be whale

products are hauled to a processing plant, divided into small parts, and processed.

 

5-3. Species of Whales Taken

Before the era of the two aforementioned companies (1953 and beyond), whalers were
capturing, for example, ﬁn whales that ran more than 20m in length. But during the
years of Miyoshi and Shimomichi the whales captured have been minke whales .
(Balaenoptera acutorostrata, also called koiwashikujira, or the little piked whale or
lesser rorqual in English) of 5-8m in length. It is the smallest of the baleen whales in
the ﬁn whale family, reaching a maximum length of 10.2m, although the whales that
pass through the waters near Japan reach lengths of 9.2m only very rarely. They weigh
between four and ten tons, but are usually about 8m long and 6 tons in weight.

Also captured are the Baird’s beaked whale (Berardius bairdii, also called northern
giant bottlenose whale or northern fourtooth whale), a toothed whale 10- 15m in length
and 10-12 tons in weight. However, both companies take mainly minke whales, for
which there are three reasons. (1) Minke whales are smaller and thus easier to
manage; (2) minke whales stay underwater for shorter periods of time, making them
easier to track (while Baird’s beaked whales often dive for an hour at a time, minke
whales surface after 10-odd minutes); and (3) minke whale meat is considered better

5-6. Abashiri Whaling and Pollution
5-6-1. Pollution Arises

As stated in section 5—2, whales are divided at ﬂensing time into usable parts and those to
be discarded. The discarded parts include blood, internal organs, the skull, and the bones.

{The blood is collected in a tank and passed on to industrial waste disposal companies
along with the internal organs and bones to be disposed of as industrial wastes.

Because in the early days of whaling the blood was left to run where it might, it appears
that both the land and the sea were polluted. Marine pollution by .whale blood has a
gseriously adverse effect on coastal ﬁshing, so much so that in 19 1 1 an incident occurred
4‘ at Hachinohe Port in Aomori Prefecture where a whaling company was burned by local
{'Eﬁsherfolk. The company burned at this time was Oka J uro’s Toyo Whaling, which was

 

 

14

 

 

 




arﬁ

 

 

 

>the company that initiated whaling at Abashiri. Since it was in 1915 that Toyo

f Whaling established a base at Abashiri, the Abashiri base was established four years
after the arson incident at Hachinohe Port. Because this flensing and processing
facility was located in a place that is now the outskirts of Abashiri, there were probably
few complaints from the local residents. But after Miyoshi and Shim omichi began their
postwar operations, one would assume that complaints of pollution were eventually
expressed owing to the blood runoff from ﬂensing in Abashiri Harbor. This problem
was solved by collecting the blood in a tank and commissioning a specialist company
to dispose of the wastes. But there were many complaints from area residents
concerning the stench that accompanied ﬂensing, and sanitation problems in the
vicinity of the processing facility. Thus Abashiri had no choice but to plan the removal
of the processing facility to Notoro Fishing Port, about 15km from the city.

5-6-2. Site Transfer, Construction of Abashiri Port, and Establishment of
Temporary Flensing Facility to Deal with Pollution

The building of Abashiri Port began in 1919 with a refuge harbor renovation project.
Work on the harbor also prepared it for use as a ﬁshing harbor, and at the same time
it was also provided with the capability as a commercial port. Abashiri City took over
management of the harbor in 1953, and it was in this year that Miyoshi Whaling
initiated operations. Because in April of 1978, nine years after Shimomichi Marine
Products began whaling operations (1969), Abashiri Port was designated a Vital
Harbor, a harbor plan which was formulated on the basis of the Harbors and Ports Law.
Word proceeded on Notoro Fishing Port at the same time as on Ab ashiri Port since the
fundamental idea of the plan was to divide the roles of ﬁshing port and commercial port.
It was at this stage that the decision was made to move the whale processing facility
to Notoro as a means of dealing with the pollution problem, and the city made the
formal decision not to incorporate the processing facility into the plan for Ab ashiri Port.
This happened in 1978. However, since Notoro Port would not be ﬁnished in time, the
city decided to establish a temporary whale processing facility using a part of Abashiri
_ Port, and this was completed in 1981.

5-6-3. The Reason for Securing a Processing Site Even When Transferring to
New Site

In order to conduct small-scale whaling, one must secure, along with an authorized
whaling vessel, a whale processing facility that satisﬁes the criteria for authorization
by the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Ab ashiri Port functioned more
and more as a commercial port, vessels of all sizes were using the port frequently, and
it became impossible to continue flensing whales there. Whaling vessels are active
during the whaling season (April to the end of October), and not the entire year.
Furthermore, it requires as much as 10- 15 minutes to tow a whale carcass into the port
and raise it into the processing facility, and during this time the other small vessels,
which are constantly using the docks, must stand by and wait. Since other small
vessels are often out at sea ﬁshing, their use of the port does not always conflict with

that of the whaling vessels, but the change in port usage is such that when whaling

. . . . . . . - - Tl
vessels bringwhales Into port it is conSIdered anuisance. What is more, as people 11v1ng

in the harbor area increasingly register complaints about the stench and pollution, the

city and whaling companies will have no choice but to move the processing facility to ’

a different, ﬁtting location, assuming that whaling operations continue.

5-6-4. The Reason N otoro Port was Chosen as the New Flensing Site
5

N otoro Port is located 15-20km from Abashiri”. Itlis well developed as a ﬁshing port,
and has a ramp for raising vessels, so that if these are improved a whale processing
facility would be possible. Additionally, since the Abashiri whaling grounds run
mainly from Abashiri to Monbetsu in the Sea of Okhotsk, and because the catch off
N otoro accounts for 40 percent, it is better to bring the whales ashore at Notoro in order
to maintain their freshness as well. Furthermore, there is a plan to bring as many
companies as possible to Notoro in the future in order to develop a marine products
industrial park, and it is thought that whaling could be incorporated into this plan.
This plan for the marine products industrial park is called the “Ab ashiri City Basic Plan
for the Promotion of Marine Products,” and commonly knownas the “Okhotsk Marine
Project in Abashiri.”

However, an economic consideration regarding the establishment of a whale processing
facility at N otoro is that 1981 calculations cited the need for capital of 15 million yen
for the buildings, equipment, and other facilities needed by one company, and this did
not include the price of the land. Today, ten years later, this cost has no doubt risen
even further. It is doubtful that the two companies now operating could afford such
a hefty capital outlay, even if they did not have to pay it all. For Abashiri City to pay
the money would mean that the circumstances surrounding whaling have undergone
too great a change.

5-6-5. The Okhotsk Marine Project in Abashiri

As stated above, this plan is ofﬁcially known as the “Abashiri City Basic Plan for the
Promotion of Marine Products,” and the general description of the plan, along with the
formulation study report (the section analyzing present circumstances) were made
public in 1989. The objective of this plan is to increase ﬁsheries production to 13.1
billion yen, and marine products processing production to 418.1 billion, in the ten-year
period between 1989 and 1999, and the plan announces that it will implement four
main programs. These programs are:

(1) The creation of a marine products processing zone.

(2) The creation of a wide-area physical distribution zone.

(3) The establishment of a zone for facilities related to increased aquaculture.
(4) The creation of a ﬁsheries culture zone.

Abashiri whaling has been incorporated into the fourth of the programs, and the plan
reads, “establishment of a facility for whale processing, and a facility for whale
exhibits.” However, the only speciﬁc reference to the whaling issue in this plan for the
promotion of marine products, which goes into considerable detail does not even take
up a whole line and just mentions the establishment of facilities for whale processing
and for exhibits. Itwould seem that even here, Abashiri whaling - as a thing of the past
- is about to disappear from the policies of the local government ofﬁcials.

5-6-6. Consideration of Notoro Port

Be that as it may, having included the eight characters in Abashiri City’s marine
products plan saying that a whale processing facility will be established in Notoro, the
authorities were presented with the necessity of investi gating local circumstances , and
thus went to examine Notoro Port. But having seen the port, it appeared that

 

16

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

  
 

establishing the processing fa ility would actually be impossible. The reason being
that N otoro Fishing Port is a lake ﬁshing port that Was built in the inner recess of Lake
N otoro, and part of the lake is beingused to farm scallops and other products. Although
there are dock facilities suited to bringing in whales, small vessels are constantly
entering the leaving the harbor, and the port did not appear to be suited to whale

processing.

When I asked three ﬁshermen (about 50 years old) working near the dock about the
construction of a whale processing facility, they all reacted with surprise at the
unexpected question and said, “There’s no whaling in Hokkaido any more.” When I
asked them again by saying that there are whaling companies in Abashiri they said,
“They’re not operating any more,” and told me that Notoro and whaling had nothing
to do with each other.

Notoro Fishing Port was designated a Class IV ﬁshing port in 1969. It has small-scale
harbor facilities in Koguchi, Futamigaoka Area, N otoro, and Ubaranai, but one
discerns nothing in these lakeside districts that suggests the existence of Abashiri’s
whaling.

Since the establishment of the whale processing facility at N otoro Fishing Port is a plan
for the future, the absence of such facilities may be only natural, but it would seem the
reality is the impression of the local ﬁshermen, in whose thinking whaling has already
ceased to exist.

5-6-7. The Social Standing of Abashiri Whaling as Seen inthe Pollution and
Relocation Problems

As shown in section 5-6-1 above, pollution problems caused by the whaling industry
go far back to 1911 and the Toyo Whaling arson incident at Hachinohe. But the best
proof that the whaling industry does not enjoy the support of local residents is that,
although the scale may differ, residents in the vicinity of the operations consider
whaling to be a pollution problem and register complaints. Because of this, companies
are forced to relocate their whaling activities. While it is a ruthless side of modern
capitalist society that closures and expulsions of industries which do not have the
support of local residents occur in accordance with the will of the people, judgingby this
instance one could only see Abashiri’s whaling as not an important part of the culture
that the local people want to preserve by all means, but rather a change in the business
climate of one industry within the ﬂux of modern commercial productiong,..«'-‘A traditional
culture that is peculiar to a certain region always has the strong support of the local ~

populace, and people Will work together to endure inconvenience and dissatisfaction ‘

in order to maintain that culture, but the very fact that people will increasingly 1:
. complain of pollution derived from those activities shows that Abashiri’s whaling;
culture is far from being traditional, ‘

5-6-8. New Pollution from Abashiri'Whaling

I have noted above that Abashiri’s whalers take minke whales and Baird’s beaked
whales. The latter is not subject to restraints by the International Whaling Convention.

 

17

 




 

 

 

l

There were reports that the two companies in AbaS’hiri have reacted in two ways amid
the restrictions imposed on minke whaling by the issuance of the moratorium on
commercial whaling: (1) they changed to capturing whales that are not subject to
restrictions by the international convention, namely Baird’s beaked whale and pilot
whales (Globicephala melaena), and (2) they conduct joint operations with Whalers in
other prefectures.

Because both these species are toothed whales, whose meat is of inferior quality, they
have lower commercial value which in turn brings lower proﬁts. In addition, they are
difficult to capture. For these main reasons the Whalers did not formerly hunt these
whales aggressively. However, since they are still whale meat, the Whalers began
taking them.

Just as I pointed out in a previous report (“Japan’s Scientiﬁc Whaling” Sekai, No. 542
June, 1990), the high costs of the meat, which came about because of the whale meat
shortage, spurred on the overcatching of small cetaceans including dolphins, and
engendered a decrease in small cetaceans such as dolphins from Tohoku to the ocean
area around Hokkaido. This has become a major international issue. (For further
information see Bibliography reference nos. 20, 21, 22, and 28.)

According to the interviews conducted on this occasion in the Town of Shari near the
, Shiretoko Peninsula, the pods of dolphins visible from shore until two or three years
ago have completely disappeared with the appearance of the small vessels pursuing
_ them, and now one cannot see dolphins at all.

The decline in the numbers of dolphins, Baird’s beaked whale, and minke whales will
no doubt continue as long as the whale meat market exists, but when one considers the
cause-and-effect relationship in which the demand in the whale meat market for the
meat of dolphins and other small cetaceans will not disappear as long as whaling
companies exist, the existence of the whaling companies at Abashiri constitutes yet
another source of “pollution” that consists in accelerating the overﬁshing of small
cetaceans, including dolphins, in the waters near Japan.

Furthermore, the joint operations with companies from other prefectures is further
evidence of the modern commercial capitalist form of Abashiri’s whaling, which
certainly cannot be termed a traditional local industry.

5-6-9. Unused Whale Portions Discarded as Industrial Waste

As noted above, at Abashiri the whaling companies commission specialist disposal
companies to dispose of the unneeded whale parts as industrial wastes, but this
investigation was unable to ascertain the way in which the wastes were ultimately
disposed. Assuming that the wastes are incinerated, this would, as a way of utilizing
bioresources, run counter to the methods of Japan’s ancient traditional whaling. But
during the era of large-scale commercial whaling in Japan, whales were not used in
totality and unwanted portions were discarded. Even so, whaling industries put to use
the internal organs for manufacturing of pharm aceuticals and fertilizer, and the bones
were used for making oils and fertilizer (in blue whales, the bones contain 40-60 percent
oil, and account for about 20 percent of body weight, while the internal organs account
for as much as 7 percent). The very fact that Abashiri’s whaling companies separate
out parts of the whales as industrial wastes and commission specialized disposal

businesses to deal with them idkaOOf that they conduct their whaling activities as part
of modern commercial activities.

‘6. TOURISM AND THE WHALING CULTURE

6-1. Tourism Facilities and Tourists

The most popular tourist attraction in this city, which became instantly famous
b ecause ofthe Yakuza ﬁlm “Abashiri Perimeter”, is the Abashiri Penitentiary, with the 4’1...
tourist ﬁgures each year showing that the penitentiary has maintained its supreme
position. Some other tourism facilities are the Okhotsk Drift Ice House, the Abashiri
Prison Museum (this is the former penitentiary building, which has been preserved as
a museum), the Okhotsk Aquarium, the Local History and Culture Museum, the
Moyoro Shell Mounds, and the Jakkadofuni Museum. [This museum features the
clothing and other artifacts of the northern native peoples, but has nothing on whaling
and is closed at present]. In order of the number of visitors to these facilities, the
penitentiary places ﬁrst, the Drift Ice House is second, the Abashiri Prison Museum
is third, the aquarium is fourth, the Local History and Culture Museum is ﬁfth, the
shell mounds are sixth, and the J akkadofuni Museum is seventh.

6-2. Natural Parks

Abashiri City’s Commerce and Tourism Section gives nine places as natural parks in
the city. They are Yobitoura Park, Mt. Tento, Mt. Daikan, Cape Notoro, Mt. Kata Park,
Futamigaoka Park, Futatsuiwa Park, Ubaranai Park, and Lake Tofutsu. Among
these sites, Mt. Tento has the greatest number of visitors, the reason being that the
Okhotsk Drift Ice House is located near the summit, and because the mountain has a
road for vehicles and a parking lot for large buses.

6-3. The Whaling Culture as Seen in Tourism Facilities

To the extent that time permitted, I walked around the aforementioned tourism
facilities and natural parks, butI saw no place that made an ambitious effort to show
Abashiri’s whaling and deﬁne it as traditional culture. Even the Local History and
Culture Museum had no such display. The places where I saw displays that showed
whaling as a traditional culture were rather the Town of Shari’s Shiretoko Museum,
and Monb etsu City’s Local History and Culture Museum, and these displays consisted
only of, at the former, a small whaling harpoon that had supposedly been caught in a
ﬁshing net-off the coast of Shari, and at the latter, the skeleton of a minke whale that
had been displayed recently. Additionally, interviews with people living in Shari and
Monbetsu turned up no one that knew the actual circumstances surrounding whaling
at Abashiri. What they did know was that until a few years ago whaling had been
conducted at Abashiri, but that, as for themselves, they had no interest in a type of
ﬁshing with such expensive equipment and such low efﬁciency, and that there were
many kinds of ﬁsh one could catch more easily in the Sea of Okhotsk without going to
all that trouble. During recent years, as well, the whaling vessels from Abashiri have
been calling at Monbetsu Port, but even among those people in Monbetsu associated
with ﬁsheries, hardly anyone was aware of this.

 

19

 




 

 

 

 

 

Even the tourism information ofﬁce by Abashiri Station had not a single guide book
on whaling, and I was unable to obtain a single bit of information on the whaling
culture even by asking the people who worked there. What is more, I was told that no
tourists at all inquired at the ofﬁce about Abashiri’s whaling.

Those elements deserving of being called the local traditional culture are in some way
incorporated into the local tourism industry or tourism activities, and efforts are being
made for their continuance, but this investigation failed to turn up any traces of this
for whaling.

After WWII, when there was insufﬁcient food, whale meat was an important source
of protein in all parts of J apan. I expected to see a display at the prison museum, where
I was looking for something on the role of whale meat as food for the inmates at the
penitentiary, the main tourist attraction in Abashiri, but I drew a blank.

These facts indicate that Abashiri’s whaling is not recognized as something that
occupies a traditional place in the region’s culture. At some later dateI hope to discover
some new facts deriving from this investigation, but the results of visits to the principal
tourist facilities and parks, as well as of interviews with citizens of the surrounding
area, cause me to lose almost all such hope.

7. THE ROLE OF THE WHALE CULINARY CULTURE
IN REGIONAL INTEGRATION

One of the bases for advocating the continuance of small-scale coastal whaling is
supposedly the whale culinary culture. Ms. IWASAKI Masami has advocated this on
the basis of her own investigation of Abashiri, and has written'a monograph. The gist
ofher investigation has been made public in a jointly authored publication (Bibliography
reference nos. 8, 14). In this publication she says that on the occasion of the New Year,
Abashiri residents make whale soup, and that “they all buy it (whale blubber) for this
purpose at any price.”

To conﬁrm this, as well as to garner other information, I interviewed people in Abashiri
City at several locations, but I was unable to obtain results that would corroborate Ms.
Iwasaki’s assertion. The proprietor of one retail store said there were no people who
said they badly wanted whale meat, and that while there were occasionally people who
came to buy it, they were from the Aomori area in Honshu. There were no local people
like that, he said.

In a shopping mall near Abashiri Port some people told me that when they were
children a whistle would blow whenever a whale was brought in, and that they would
often run to the beach to see the whale being ﬂensed. However, they never once
received any of the whale meat on those occasions. (Reference no. 14).

Ms. Iwasaki also contends that divvyingup whale meat, as well as the culinary culture,
played an important role in the regional integration of Abashiri , butI am not convinced
by the argument that this is essential to the regional integration of the residents of this
modern city, Abashiri. It would seem that the community handing out whale meat

 

20

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

which Ms. Iwasaki investigated was limited to a private circle of friends associated
with the two whaling companies that flourished after the war, while the results
obtained from this preliminary investigation indicate that one would be going too far
in enlarging this to cover the entire modern city of Abashiri, with its population of
43,000.

As we have already seen, one would be hard put to term the existing two Abashiri
whaling companies traditional whaling, and the system of divvying up and giving
whale meat within the small community of associates encompassing mainly these two
whaling companies could also probably be found in the communities associated with
other companies such as those associated with salmon or scallops. Furthermore, this
sort of gift-giving custom is recognized all over Japan, even in the greater society
outside those people associated with whaling and other types of ﬁshing, as well as their
communities.

Within the Abashiri whaling community, salmon and salmon roe are being substituted
as gifts because of the whale meat shortage, and one way of seeing this is that the
. former “culture” is being destroyed. But it does not stand to reason that, just because
of this, whaling mustbe revived. The change in gifts within private communities owing
to changes in the kinds of marine life taken is seen as a commonplace everyday
occurrence in all other communities. For example, fewer people use herring roe —- a
traditional Japanese food for the new year — due to the smaller herring catches. It
would seem that the people of Abashiri realize this as well. When Ms. Iwasaki
enunciated her argument at the February 1989 Third Northern Ethnic Cultural
Symposium, which was held in Abashiri, an article reported that a participant had
asked - “This isn’t a change peculiar to small-scale whaling, is it? Doesn’t this also hold
for salmon and other deep sea ﬁsheries?” (Abashiri Shimbun, Feb. 26, 1989) This
appears to constitute criticism of Ms. Iwasaki’s view that this phenomenon is unique
to the whaling community.

Ms. Iwasaki’s argument is little more than an example of a small community, and it
is evident from this report thus far that one cannot use that argument as a basis for
advocating the traditional nature and cultural values of Abashiri’s whaling.

8. A PROPOSAL FOR THE FUTURE

8-1. Changes in Abashiri’s Fishing Industry

Abashiri’s ﬁshing industry has come to a major juncture of change, wherein it is
attempting to liberate itself from the take-everything type of ﬁshing conducted until
now, and switch to an industry that raises ﬁsh. The waters off the coastal frontage have
been entirely designated as an area for the establishment of ﬁsh farming facilities, and
a plan is underway to make this a reality. This is the plan mentioned previously, the
“Abashiri City Basic Plan for the Promotion of Marine Products,” which will take ten
years to complete, and it would seem that, in view of the circumstances, now is the time
for Abashiri’s whaling industry to proceed with a radical transformation.

 

21

 

 




 

 

 

There have been major changes in the ixliternational situation surrounding whaling,
with the state of affairs being such that the protection of both large and small whales
has become an urgent world task. In view of this situation, it is impossible to avoid
censure for being anachronistic by viewingthe whalingissue from a narrow perspective.
One’s considerations must always be considered from the perspective of the overall
situation that involves whaling, and world environmental problems. I have already
treated a part of this matter in another report (“Japan’s Scientiﬁc Whaling” Sekai No.
542, June, 1990), but the following proposals are conceivable for the whaling at
Abashiri that I have taken up in this report.

8-2. A Recommendation for the Total Shutdown of Abashiri Whaling and the
Whale Meat Market

It is historically evident that Abashiri’s whaling is a form of modern commercial
whaling. It’s origin, as well, is ineligible to assume the description “traditional,” and
it has little support from area residents as the traditional culture of the region. Not
only does this whaling bear the onus of pollution caused by the processing of whales,
it is also in fact nearly impossible for the processing facility to move to a new location.
Furthermore, the existence of the whaling industry and the whale meat market is
accelerating the overﬁshing of the dolphins and small whales that pass through coastal
waters, and has become a still greater source of environmental degredation that is
propelling these species toward the crisis of extinction. Additionally, since it would
seem that the argument about the collapse of the regional community is an exaggerated,
illusionary interpretation, it would be desirable in view of the foregoing facts to
completely shut down Abashiri whaling and the whale meat market for the time being.

8-3. The Establishment of a Whale Research Program and a Change in the
Regulating Administrative Authority

In addition to institutinga program for basic surveys of the whale species offshore from
Ab ashiri, it is desirable to change the regulating administrative government authority
from the Fisheries Agency to the Environment Agency. On a world level, regarding
whales as marine products is already the practice of a past era, and the deﬁnition of
whales is, rather than something to be taken like ordinary species of ﬁsh, an animal
whose stocks are managed on the basis of meticulous surveys of its ecology.

In 1989 the Tokyo University of Agriculture opened its Okhotsk campus in Abashiri.
When I visited this University I found a Bioproduction Department within a School of
Bioindustry Studies, within which there had been established an Animal Resources
Laboratory and a Hydrosphere Resources Laboratory, and there was also a Bioresources
Development Research Institute. They have only begun their work, but for the time
being one hopes that these research organizations systematically conduct fundamental
surveys of cetacean ecology.

Also, in an effort to establish the ﬁshing grounds observation system mentioned in the
“Ab ashiri City Basic Plan for the Promotion of Marine Products,” a plan has been
established for the construction of a Marine Technopark (near Lake N otoro), and this
includes a plan for the establishment of a Marine Life Research Institute. The planners
should promote this project aggressively, and establish within this institute a research
division for cetacean ecology. Because the ﬁshing grounds environmental information
system plan also includes a plan for promoting a satellite meteorological information

 

22

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

\

system, one can conceive of the possibility that, by using this system, one could
research whale ecology by tracking them with satellites.

However, we must ﬁrst of all halt for a time the social mechanism by which whales are
killed for proﬁt. This, in order to initially run this research program adequately from
a purely academic perspective, and accumulate the necessary basic knowledge. The
reason is that whales ability to replenish their own numbers is far lower than that of
ﬁsh, and it would therefore seem there are not sufficient stocks to allow a survey of basic
whale ecology while capturing them by killing.

8-4. _ A Recommendation for a Policy to Shift from the Utilization of Dead
Whales to That of Live Whales

Now on the rise throughout the world is whale watching — a way of utilizing living
whales that does not necessitate killing them. While only two or three years ago one
could not hope to see this new method in Japan, it has begun to arise all over the
country, holding out the possibility of becoming a major industry. It begin at Tosa in
Shikoku and the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands administered by Tokyo, and there are now
signs that the industry will bloom in places such as Okinawa and Muroran (Hokkaido).

I visited Cape Notoro in order to ascertain the possibility of whale watching in Ab ashiri.
Cape N otoro is about 10km from Abashiri City as the crow flies, and it has been
prepared as a natural park. This is a location of outstanding beauty that affords an
expansive view of the Sea of Okhotsk, and accounts say that during the Taisho Era (the
19105) one could, from this point, espy many pods of whales spouting as they travelled
through this area. The view from this place is much like that from the Hawaiian whale
watching base Lahaina in that it offers favorable conditions allowing one to observe
whales from shore. Since this cape is a high bluff it is difﬁcult to put out to sea from
here, but because there is a peaceful ﬁshing port at nearby Lake Notoro, it would be
possible to make an industry of whale watching by using this as a base.

There are pasture lands around Cape N otoro and Lake Notoro, and forested areas still
remain; there are also good paved roads, and even here I encountered a wild Northern
Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes schrencki). By establishing nature observation trails in the
forested areas and building a nature center, Abashiri could develop a new tourism
project, against the majestic natural backdrop of both land and sea, to work on the
coexistence of wildlife and human beings.

8-5. A Recommendation that the Existing Two Whaling Companies Switch
to a New Business

Word has it that the two whaling companies still extant in Abashiri are falling upon
harder and harder times. Both government and the private sector are responsible for
this, with the Fisheries Agency having a particularly heavy responsibility. In view of
the fact that other whaling enterprises at former whaling bases have extricated
themselves from their predicaments by switching to new businesses, one would like to
recommend that Abashiri’s two whaling companies also convert their enterprises to
conform to new world circumstances. It is, of course, up to the preferences and
resolution of each company’s proprietor as to what kind of new business to choose, but
at this time the following three paths are conceivable as ways of utilizing the
techniques of the whaling industry in which they have engaged to the present.

 

23

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

8-5-1. A Switch to the Whale Watching Industry

There are precedents for the switch to whale watching by former whaling enterprises
in Tosa and Ogasawara. According to presentations made at the First Whale Watching
Summit held last year (1990) in Tokyo, the whale watching business has accumulated
a good deal of expertise where it is practiced, and the outlook is that it offers a great
deal of promise as an industry. It therefore follows that the conversion to the whale
watching industry with the Cape Notoro area as a base is not just a pipe dream, but
a concrete plan capable of being realized.

8-5-2. A Project to Preserve the Whaling Culture

I have noted above (5-6-4 and 5-6-5) that Abashiri City has planned the construction
of a marine products industrial park as part of a project to revitalize the area behind
NOtoro Port, and that this plan includes, as a major element, the establishment of a
facility for whale processing, and a facility for whale exhibits.

This plan is part of the plan for the creation of a ﬁshing culture zone. In addition to
making this whale exhibit facility act as a museum (“Fishing Culture Museum”) and
getting serious about preservingAbashiri’s whaling culture, it might be possible to ﬁnd
new jobs for the employees of the two whaling companies by employing them at this
facility. Museum personnel must of course include people in the arts and sciences who
have received specialized education, but hiring people with extensive actual experience
for the transitional period would have an importance equal to that of rangers at a
nature center. There is an actual example of former Whalers being employed by a
whaling culture preservation facility in Augusta, Australia.

It is conceivable that this museum facility would, in addition to bringing together
historical information and artifacts on whaling in Abashiri, act as the land-based
center for whale watching.

It would, of course, be faster and easier to use existing museums in the collection and
exhibition of whaling information and artifacts, but it would probably be difﬁcult to
ﬁnd new jobs there for the employees of the two whaling companies.

8-5-3. Amalgamation of the Two Whaling Companies, and their Switch to a
New Business

Because the two local whaling businesses are both small companies, conversion would
be more efﬁcient by joining them into one company and making that into something
like a public corporation. But this would probably be impossible as long as they insist
upon the continuation of whaling because the condition for receiving permission to
conduct whaling operations is one vessel per company, and because the combined
company could probably not make a proﬁt with only one vessel. However, switching
from whaling to a different business would make it possible to join the two companies,
and a new possibility would emerge. Ivisited the Abashiri City Industrial Association
in quest of such a possibility. Because of time constraints I could not survey the
situation adequately, but, just as in other prefectures, towns, -and villages, the
Association implements measures to help many kinds of small and medium sized
enterprises, it would seem that there is a way to provide capital assistance for
converting to new businesses. -

 

 
   

2'4

 

 




 

8-5-4. Other Possibilities for New ﬁusinesses, or for Shutting Down

Though still too early for Japan, one can conceive of the possibilities for businesses
oriented toward small cetaceans, including dolphins, such as rescue centers for
beached whales, rehabilitation centers that return to the wild small cetaceans from
exhibition facilities that have bankrupted and closed, or even the establishment of
cetacean research institutions with private capital that is clearly distinct from the
whaling industry. If Abashiri’s two whaling companies would jointly plan and
implement such a project, it would garner the attention of the entire world. What is
more, this would be a milestone new enterprise preparing us for the twenty-ﬁrst
century and providing for the coexistence of humanity and the environment -
something far better than what the two companies did after the war by gambling their
destinies on the whaling venture business.

9. CONCLUSION

In order to examine on site the basis for the Japanese government’s argument
advocated vehemently at the annual IWC meetings for the continuation of Japan’s
small-scale coastal whaling, I conducted a preliminary investigation at Abashiri, the
location of the only coastal whaling base left in Hokkaido, and this led, for the time
being, to the following conclusion.

9-1. Modern Cities and Whaling

Abashiri is a modern city of some 43,000 inhabitants joined to Japan’s principal large
cities such as Tokyo and Sapporo by air in less than one hour. It also offers access by
paved roads and rail lines, the indispensable arteries of communication for human
activities such as industry and production, thus differing totally from the image of a
poor village in the north country. One can obtain any kind of merchandise just as in
Tokyo, and in no way could it be said that the regional society would not exist unless
it depended upon whaling.

9-2. Change in Proportions of Population Employed by Industry

The structure of Abashiri’s working population has arrived at a major juncture
wherein the proportion of people working in the primary industries such as ﬁshing is
falling precipitously, and there is an increase in the proportion of the population
employed in the tertiary industries such as the services and commerce. Theproportion
of the population employed in the primary industries in 1985 was 14.8 percent, which
includes the three ﬁelds of agriculture, forestry, with the proportion for ﬁsheries, and
that for whaling within this category, being even smaller. With respect to the total
number of enterprises, whaling accounts for a proportion of 0.06 percent. This
indicates that the whaling industry does not inﬂuence the existence of Abashiri City.

9-3. In Consideration of Income by Industry

The facts noted in the preceding section also hold for the city’s total income by industry.
Income from the marine products industry is about 5.6 percent of the income from all

 

25

 

 




 

 

  

industries, and that from the whaling industry is an exceedingly small part of this 5.6
percent.

94' ffAbashiri Whaling is Commercial Whaling

Whaling at Abashiri was initiated in 1911 by the Toyo Whaling Co. Ltd., which was
in turn founded on Norwegian-style whaling and modern capital, and run by a person
? from Honshu’s Yamaguchi Prefecture. It has repeatedly shut down and resumed
f operations on the basis of its business performance, and thus cannot be regarded as
traditional whaling continuously in operation from the past.

9-5. Present Whaling Began After WWII

Operations by the existin gtwo Ab ashiri whaling companies began after the war in both
cases, one in 1945 and the other in 1969. As of 1991 they have histories of only 20-odd
J years and 40 years, making it difﬁcult to call them traditional whaling.J/

9-6. . Low Dependence on Whaling ”
f.-

A look at ﬁshing methods, catch production volumes, and the number of associated
marine product enterprises shows thatAbashiri City has an extremely low dependence
on whaling, and thus the argument that without whaling the city would perish is little
more than a fantasy.

9-7. fWhaling is a Polluting Industryﬁw

People living in the vicinity of Abashiri Port have objected to the whaling industry for
its pollution, and from the end of the 19703 to the beginning of the 1980s the city
authorities found themselves in a situation demanding the removal of the whale
processing facility to the outskirts of the city. However, the removal has yet to be
completed, with only a temporary processing facility having been constructed in a
different location.

The very fact that the industry has been criticized as a polluting business by the area
' residents is the best proof that whaling, in their minds, is far from the concept of a
. cultural tradition, and that the industry does not enjoy the support of the people in the
region. It would be hard to say that the people of Abashiri see whaling as a regional
culture of which to be proud.

Additionally, an on-site inspection of Notoro Port, to which the city plans to transfer
the processing facility, revealed that such a plan would probablybe impossible.

9-8. New Pollution from Abashiri’s Whaling

The continuation of coastal small-scale whaling, as well as the existence of the whale
meat market, have engendered the overﬁshing of the small cetaceans, including
dolphins, that pass through the waters near Japan, and this is inducing a crisis that
threatens these small cetaceans with extinction. Hokkaido is not -an exception, and
Abashiri’s whaling has become a new source of pollution. It is urgent that Abashiri’s
whaling halt operations at the earliest possible moment, but even now the vessels of
these two companies are often in dry dock and do not put out to sea, showing that in

 
   

 

26

 

 




 

actuality the situation has not permitted their operation. However, there are now
instances of these two companies conducting joint operations with Whalers in other
prefectures owing to these circumstances, there is still the danger of more pollution by
exterminating small cetaceans. It is necessary to shut down the operations of these
two companies, and to close the whale meat market.

”I"

[ll .3‘
9'9' [Whaling Enjoys N0 Support as a Tourism Culture f“
I,

The traditional culture of a region has status as the tourism culture of that region, and
people for this reason try to preserve it. At the same time, it has a broad base of support
among the general population. Although Abashiri has seven representative tourism
facilities and nine natural parks, I saw no exhibits within these facilities and parks that
deﬁned Abashiri’s whaling as the region’s traditional culture, or made an aggressive
effort to preserve it. This indicates that the citizens of Abashiri are only barely
conscious of Abashiri’s whaling.

9-10. Expanded Interpretationof the Whale Culinary Culture

The whale meat culinary culture based on Ab ashiri’s whaling seems to be an exception
limited to the very small circle of people associated mostly with the whaling companies.
I was unable to ﬁnd a consciousness among the citizens that would corroborate Ms.
Iwasaki Masami’s argument that the whale meat culinary culture performs a crucial
role that unites all the people of the region. My short-term preliminary investigation
was not adequate to completely negate Mr. Iwasaki’s argument, but in view of the other
matters taken up in this report, it would seem that Ms. Iwasaki’s argument constitutes
an expanded interpretation of customs of courtesy seen throughout Japanese society
in general, by which she has taken a custom practiced among those associated with
whaling, and made it into something felt by all the people of Abashiri.

Although one could positively evaluate Ms. Iwasaki’s survey as research on the theme
of the small industrial whaling community, it is mistaken to insist upon the traditional
nature and justiﬁability of Abashiri’s whaling merely on the basis of that survey.

9-11. /Abashiri’s Whaling — Switch to New Business or Shut Down ,
,/

Judging by the previous discussion, it would seem that shutting down Abashiri’s
whaling is an urgent matter. Possibilities for re-employment exist in the whale
watching industry, and in the construction of a museum to preserve the accomplishments
of the industry’s activities until the present as the whaling culture, with the re-
employment of Whalers at this facility. Abashiri’s policy for its marine products
industry includes no plan for a whale watching industry, but this is worthy of
consideration as a plan to make the tourism culture sector ﬂourish.

9- 12. Summary
A summary of this conclusion would be the same as section 1 above, which is to say that

I see a fundamental error in the position of the Japanese government for advocating
the continuance of Abashiri’s whaling. '

10. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all those people who kindly cooperated
with me in conducting the preliminary investigation, in the cities of Abashiri, Shari,
Shiretoko, Notoro, and Monbetsu, for the preparation of this monograph. Although I
should properly thank all the peOple, both public servants and citizens, who assisted
in my effort by giving their names here, I think it best to omit names and descriptions
of those who cooperated owing to the fact that this monograph treats an issue that
involves the interests of local people. Although my own interests have nothing
whatever to do with the residents of the aforementioned cities, I would like to avoid
providing the spark with this monograph that would ignite a conflagration in the
region. I am sure the reader will understand. ‘

In closing, I should like to express my sincere hope for the future prosperity of those
cities.

As you can see from the news release, Mr. Linares was found

guilty on the most serious of the two counts with which he was
charged (illegally smuggling a quantity of worked African elephant
ivory from Nigeria into the United States). This conviction
carries a maximum prison sentence of five years and a fine of up to

$250, 000.00.

NEWS RELEASE

Roberto Martinez, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida,
announced today that Ricardo Linares was convicted of illegally smuggling a quantity of
worked African elephant ivory from Nigeria, in violation of the African Elephant
Conservation Act, Title 16, U.S.C. § 4223(5); the Endangered Species Act, Title 16, U.S.C.
§ 1538(d)(1)(B); and the smuggling statute, Title 18, U.S.C. § 545. Judge William Hoeveler
specifically found that the defendant was "quite aware" that he could not bring ivory into the
United States and that he tried to hide the ivory. Judge Hoeveler also found that the
defendant was going to engage in commerce with the ivory once he got it to Miami. This
case is believed to be the first conviction after a trial under the African Elephant
Conservation Act.

The importation of elephant ivory from any country was banned in June 1989 by a
moratorium established by the United States. (54 Federal Register 24758). The African
elephant has been listed as a threatened species since 1973 under the Endangered Species
Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. § 1531-1543. Moreover, Congress found in the African Elephant
Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. § 4201, et. seq., signed into law on October 7, 1988):

"Elephant populations in Africa have declined at analarming
rate since the mid-1970’s. . .

The large illegal trade in African elephant ivory is the major
cause of this decline and threatens the continued existence of
the African elephant." 16 U.S.C. §4202( 1) and (2).

According to the indictment and public documents, on November 6, 1990, the
defendant, Ricardo Linares, attempted to claim a shipment which he had imported into
Miami from Nigeria and which contained twenty pieces of carved elephant ivory worth
approximately $15,000 on the retail market.

Mr. Linares was found guilty on September 24, 1992 after a week-long non-jury trial
before Judge William Hoeveler. The defendant was acquitted on Count II of the indictment,
which charged him with making a false statement to United States Customs ofﬁcials. The
defendant faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and up to $250,000.00 in ﬁnes on
Count I.

Mr. Martinez commended the United States Customs Service and the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service for its work in this case.

Establishment and Preservation of Reference Inbred
Strains of Rats For General Purpose Use

Report on U.S. — Japan Non-Energy Research and Development
Cooperation: Laboratory Animal Science

Tatsuji Nomura, MD. and Stephen Potkay, V.M.D.

INTRODUCTION

Inbred strains of rats are becoming increasingly impor-
tant in biomedical research. Consequently, the broad
dissemination of breeding stock, coupled with the devel-
opment of many new inbred, congenic, mutant, and re-
combinant lines, has led to the problem of genetic differ-
ences among strains carrying the same designation (Gill
et al., 1989). Indeed, Bender et al. (1984), Natori et al.
(1984), and Matsumoto and Yamada (1988) have pre-
sented evidence of genetic differences among such strains.
Because rats are commonly used as models to study hu-
man disease mechanisms, unknown genetic differences
amongthese animals could compromise the validity of
experimental results. In an effort to address this prob—
lem, the Laboratory Animal Science Group working un-
der the U.S.—Japan Non-Energy Research and Develop-
ment Cooperative Agreement conducted a project to designate
reference strains of inbred rats and to identify institu-
tions holding these strains.

RATIONALE FOR ESTABLISHING
REFERENCE STRAINS

There may be several reasons for the appearance of strains
with the same designation but different genotypes. These
' include residual heterozygosity resulting from the coun-
teracting effects of natural selection for reproductive fit-
ness, independent derivation from the same outbred stock,

 

separation before complete genetic fixation, mutation,
and unplanned outcrossing.

SELECTION OF REFERENCE RAT STRAINS

Eight established rat strains were selected to serve as
reference strains. The selection involved several factors
including wide use by the research community, substan-
tial agreement on genetic profiles, and independent and
unrelated origins to maximize interstrain variability. Based
on these criteria six strains maintained at the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) were chosen: ACI/N, BN/SsN,
BUF/N, F344/N, LEW/N, and WF/N. Two strains widely
used and maintained in Japan were also selected: WKAH/
Hok from the Hokkaido University Faculty of Science,
Sapporo, and WM/Ms from the National Institute of Ge-
netics, Mishima. The origins of these strains are shown
in Figure 1. Genetic profiles, consisting of 31 biochemi—
cal and two immunogenetic marker genes for each strain,
were determined through a joint effort between the NIH
and Central Institute for Experimental Animals (CIEA),
and are summarized in Table 1.

MAINTENANCE, PRODUCTION, AND
PRESERVATION OF REFERENCE STRAINS

The principal objective in the maintenance and produc—
tion of these strains is to minimize the probability of ge—

CONCLUSIONS

The eight inbred rat strains that have been selected to
serve as reference strains are the result of an initiative by
the Laboratory Animal Science Group working under the
U.S.—Japan Non—Energy Research and Development
Cooperative Agreement. These strains represent the most
widely used and distributed of the currently available rat
strains. The results of this initiative also demonstrated
the necessity to establish an effective committee to stan—

 

dardize the nomenclature of rat strains. Efforts are un-
derway to establish such a committee.

INTRODUCTION

The laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) is extensively used
in experimental transplantation, cancer research, immu-
nology, and toxicology. There are well over 100 different
strains of rats listed in Inbred Strains in Biomedical Re-
search (Festing, 1979); however, very few of these strains
are used regularly by investigators worldwide. Many of
these inbred strains with the same name were indepen-
dently deriVed from outbred stock; therefore, these strains
may vary genetically. It is desirable that these strains be
genetically uniform and constant, and establishing ge—
netically defined reference strains of rats would help to
ensure uniformity. Regular monitoring of the animals’
genetic profiles is also necessary to ensure that these
strains remain genetically homogeneous. Genetic moni-
toring is customarily accomplished by testing each strain

 

for a set of biochemical markers, such as polymorphic
proteins and enzymes, and immunologic markers. Recent—
ly, molecular techniques have also been employed.

Immunologic markers, such as histocompatibility anti-
gens (MHC) and blood group antigens, are extremely impor-
tant parameters in experimental transplantation, and they
can be employed as useful markers for genetic monitor-
ing. These antigens can be determined with relative ease,
and a large number of well-defined reagents for deter-
mining them are available.

For many years, rats from the NIH Genetic Resource
have been widely used as models in transplantation re-
search. However, many of these strains have never been
tested for their histocompatibility type and/or blood
group antigens. Here we report RT1.A (MHC class I anti-
gens), RT2, and RT3 (blood group) specificities of 44
inbred and congenic strains of rats from the NIH Genetic
Resource.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Table 1 lists the monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies
that were used for determining the RT1.A, RT2, and RT3
specificities. Their immunoglobulin isotypes, the strain
combinations in which the antibodies were raised, and
their respective specificities are also shown. Production
of monoclonal antibodies has been described previously
(Misra et al.. 1981). Several examples will illustrate this
approach. Monoclonal antibody 211-4-D9, which was
produced by immunizing the (MR x WKA)Fl hybrid
strain (RT1.A"”‘) with lymphocytes from the DA (RT1.A")
strain, is specific for the A"1 antigen and will react only
with all strains of rats carrying the RT1.A“ specificity.
Monoclonal antibody 3-5—1 18 will react with several dif-
ferent haplotypes and serves as a useful reagent for the
general detection of class I MHC antigens.
Affinity-purified monoclonal antibodies to MHC class
I specificities were biotinylated, and their binding to
peripheral blood lymphocytes was measured with FITC-
conjugated avidin using an Epics Profile 11 flow cytometer.
Some monoclonal antibodies were used in concentrated
and purified form, and their binding was measured with
FITC conjugated to rabbit anti-rat IgG (Fab’)2. Figures 1

Volume 33, Number 3 Summer 1991

and 2 show ﬂow cytometric analyses of the monoclonal
antibodies to the RT1.A specificities with the appropri-
ate negative and positive controls. Measurement of ﬂuores-
cence intensity (degree of binding) is shown on a log scale.
Positive reactions show 90% or greater binding of fluores-
cein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody to lympho—
cytes and negative reactions show less than 5% binding.

Hemagglutination in Ficoll (Kunz and Gill, 1974) was
used to assay for RT1.Ag with polyclonal antibody No.
7548. This method was also used to assay for RT2 and
RT3 specificities using both polyclonal and monoclonal
antibodies.

RESULTS

The reactivity patterns of 44 inbred and congenic strains
of rats from the NIH Genetic Resource with the panel of
monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are shown in Table
2. Two animals (siblings) of each strain from pedigreed
parents were tested, and their generation of inbreeding is
listed. The RT1.A haplotype, as deduced from the reac—
tivity pattern, and the RT2 and RT3 (blood group anti—
gens) specificities are given.

There were no equivocal reactivities detected. The re-
activity pattern and deduced RT] .A" haplotype for the MNR/
AN strain was unexpected, because the prototypic MNR
strain had been described by Stark et a1. (1978) as having
the RTI’" (formerly H-Im) haplotype and as showing reac-
tivity patterns with antibodies to class I antigens similar to
those of the MR/N strain but having the RTIB/D" (class 11)
specificity. Thus, the MNR strain is a natural recombinant
strain; it was later designated as the prototypic strain of the
m haplotype (RT1.A"B/D"). Some MNR strains of British
origin had been typed earlier by Kren (1974).

There have been reports that some BUF strains have
the RT] “ haplotype and that the RT2” specificity has been
found in some colonies of BN rats. The results from this
study show that the BUF/N at F134 has maintained the
RTI” haplotype, as described originally by Palm (1971)
and by Stark et a1. (1979), thus confirming the strain’s
genetic purity. It should be used as the prototypic strain
for the RTI” haplotype. Similarly, the BN/SsN strain at
F86 still types for the RT2" and RT3” specificities as
described earlier in the BN strain obtained from Dr. Carl
Hansen in 1974 (Kunz and Gill, 1978). In summary,
MHC specificities and blood group antigens serve as
useful markers for genetic monitoring of inbred rat strains
and should be used in addition to biochemical markers
and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
mapping. In view of the extensive use of rats in experi-
mental transplantation, knowledge of their transplanta-
tion antigens is critical.

Introduction

Because of considerable interest from Congress, the Na—
tional Institutes of Health (NIH), and the public about
animal welfare and alternatives to animal testing, the
National Library of Medicine (NLM) searches its online
databases and prepares quarterly annotated bibliographies
on alternative or in vitro methods for toxicity testing and
biomedical research. The objective is to present current
literature, organized as citations with brief annotations,
for easy scanning.

The Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources (ILAR)
has invited NLM to publish in ILAR News an annual
supplement, like this one, which is an edited, concat—
enated version of the quarterly bibliographies. The ILAR
News Editorial Panel and outside reviewers will edit and
condense the quarterly bibliographies so the entries are
appropriate for the ILAR News audience.

The scientific community is concerned with humane
animal care and is sensitive to public concerns about how
and why animals are used in biomedical research and
toxicity testing. The following events reﬂect the in-
volvement of the public and the U.S. government in this
issue: an array of federal legislation related to animal
welfare and the use of laboratory animals, U.S. Public
Health Service policy on the humane care and use of
laboratory animals, and efforts at NIH to promote and
support a search for alternative methods to the use of
animals in biomedical research and testing.

Scientists generally view the use of laboratory ani—
mals in biomedical research and toxicity testing as nec—
essary, except where valid, scientific alternatives are available.
It is unlikely that in vitro methods will satisfy all testing
requirements. However, when animals must be used, the
scientific community supports careful consideration of
the number of animals used and encourages reductions
when they are scientifically feasible. Indeed, three Rs
have emerged the area of animal testing alternatives:
replacement, refinement, and reduction.

Therefore, by providing the scientific community with
access to its bibliographic databases and by producing
bibliographies on animal alternatives, NLM is support-
ing efforts by the NIH to increase the knowledge needed
to develop methods of biomedical research and experi-
mentation that

° do not require the use of vertebrate animals,

° reduce the number of vertebrate animals used in
research,

' produce less pain and distress in vertebrate animals
than do current methods,

° validate or demonstrate the reliability of nonanimal
methods, and

° increase the use of nonvertebrate animal research
methods that have been found to be valid and reliable.

The NLM anticipates an acceleration in the development
of alternative or in vitro methods used in toxicity testlng

Volume 33, Number 3 Summer 1991

and biomedical experimentation, which will result in more
articles about these methods in the literature.

The NLM hopes the bibliographies, compiled from its
databases, will help ILAR News readers keep abreast of
the new literature. Information on ordering the unedited,
quarterly bibliographies or reprints of this edited annual
supplement can be found on the inside cover of this
insert. Please direct any comments or suggestions to Dr.
George J. Cosmides, National Library of Medicine, Bethesda,

an unprotected pup based on his behavior toward a pro-
tected pup within a tube made of wire—mesh window/
ﬂy screen. Ninety percent of the predictions based on
a male’s behavior toward the protected pup matched
with his behavior toward the unprotected pup. Results
demonstrate that the behavioral measurements neces-
sary for infanticidal experiments can be accomplished
humanely and accurately without risk or injury to live

pups.

The mouse skin cocarcinogens fluoranthene, pyrene,
and undecane were used with the indirect-acting car—
cinogen, benzo(a)pyrene, and the direct-acting alky-
lating carcinogen, beta—propiolactone, in an in vitro
transformation assay. Dose response, cytotoxicity, and
transformation studies with these compounds were
performed with a subclone (A3l-1-1) of the Balb/3T3
cell line. All cells isolated from transformed foci
showed characteristics of transformed cells including
anchorage—independent growth.

adhesive tumor—cell assay system and radiosensitivity
(82: survival at 2.0 Gy) values have been measured.
The characteristics of these cultures, such as growth
rate, clonogenicity and growth enhancement by epi-
dermal growth factor, do not correlate with S2. The
average S2 value of the 72 cultures is 0.33, which is
lower than for cultures derived from melanomas and
lung adenocarcinomas. Twenty-six patients followed
up for at least 15 months have been evaluated for local
tumor control. The average S2 value of the seven
patients with recurrences in this group is slightly higher
(0.43) than that from the other patients (0.30). There
is considerable overlap of 82 values in the two groups,
and more patients must be evaluated before the groups
can be compared statistically.

Medium term bioassay methods for hepatocarcinogens
and nonhepatic organ systems have been developed as
a bridge to overcome the disadvantages of in vitro
short term tests and the longer 2 year assays. Male
F344 rats were initiated with O or 200 mg/kg

diethylnitrosamine. The test compound was given 2
weeks later, the rats killed at week 8 and the liver
assayed for placental glutathione—S—transferase. Using
136 chemicals, 41 tested positive. Twenty-seven of 30
hepatocarcinogens gave positive results. None of the
noncarcinogens gave positive results. This method uses
fewer animals and is shorter than the conventional 2
year in vivo assay.

Validation in the context of in vitro toxicity tests is

1989. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. l3(4):621—3.

Conduct of any form of testing of potentially hazard-
ous materials in animals, including lethality or eye
and skin irritation testing, should be undertaken only
after careful consideration of the necessity for, the
objectives behind, and the possible alternatives to,
such testing. Acute toxicity testing to determine an
approximate lethal dose provides a basis for a com-
parison of the relative toxicities of different materials.
These data are used to classify materials for transpor-
tation and labeling, to provide information for treat-
ment of acute intoxications, to aid in dose selection
for subsequent toxicity studies, and to provide com-
parison data for evaluation and validation of alterna-
tive methods in toxicology. Although the classical
LD50 test provides a general estimate of the quantity
of chemical likely to cause death, much of the same
information can be provided by other forms of testing
in which significantly fewer numbers of animals are
employed. Acute eye and skin irritation tests on chemical
substances are conducted in order to characterize the
hazards associated with ocular or dermal exposure. At
present, tests in intact animals are the only means of
assessing the potential hazard from such exposure other
than direct testing in man. Although validated in vitro
alternatives to eye and skin irritation tests in animals
are not available currently, many tests under develop-
ment show promise and may be useful as initial screening
techniques. Complete validation of these alternate forms
of testing for irritation may reduce the need to use
whole animals. Until these procedures have been thor—
oughly tested and validated, the investigator will have
to rely on conventional methods.

The LD50 test was introduced by Trevan in 1927 for
biological standardization of dangerous drugs. Since
then, the LD50 has gained wide acceptance as a mea-
sure of acute toxicity of all types of substances. Re-
cently, however, the LD50 test has been criticized as
an unnecessary waste of resources. Therefore, efforts

have been made to reduce the number of animals used
in such tests and to avoid using this test unless re-
quired by regulations. Future approaches include in
vitro cytotoxicity methods and computer—based struc-
ture-activity models. It is felt that, when LD50 tests
are required, the most economical approach should be
used, without undue concern for statistical precision.

Dresser, R. 1988. Standards for animal research:
looking at the middle. J. Med. Philos. 13(2): 123-43.

Much of the public debate over laboratory animal use
has focused on either the scientist’s demand for abso-
lute freedom of inquiry, or the abolitionist’s demand for
an end to animal use in science. Yet many recent
proposals for reform seek instead to balance the inter—
ests of laboratory animals in avoiding harm against the
interests of research beneficiaries in continued animal
use. This essay is an analysis of the intermediate reform
positions and their underlying ethical principles.

Safety testing illustrates a very real ethical dilemma
between moral obligations to protect humans and to
protect animals from harm. The pragmatic approach
to resolving this conﬂict is to pursue the 3 Rs of
Replacement, Reduction and Refinement. Safety tests
set out in regulation protocols often conflict with this
ethic, being wasteful in numbers of animals used, hav-
ing unnecessarily severe endpoints, and resulting in
duplication. Suggestions for refinement of these tests
are discussed. It is concluded that such refinement
could lead to the generation of more meaningful data,
thus improving both animal protection and human safety.

Lansdell, H. 1988. Laboratory animals need only
humane treatment: animal “rights” may debase human

Arguments for animal “rights” confuse the issue of
what rights are about and, in the context of the care of
laboratory animals, are misleading. Only human be—
ings have rights and they should be cherished and
extended. Consideration of the welfare of animals is
important, but the context is that it is for the benefit of
human beings and the animals serving humanity. Sci-
entists need to explain the worth of animal research,
particularly in regard to psychological studies. They
also need to expose the fallacies in the animal right-
ists’ arguments as one of the means to help diminish
the threat to science.

wherever possible, a replacement of in vivo methods
by in vitro test systems. By scoping on papers pub-

situation of animal experimentation is evaluated. Methods
are suggested to bring a reduction in the number of

The role of the veterinarian in working with toxicolo—

vitro alternatives remain the long term objective, the
modification of existing in vivo methods to permit
non-lethal endpoints and the possibility of using anal—

A method was developed for the identification of pos—
sible aneuploidy inducing agents and rapid assay us-
ing cytokinesis blocked human lymphocytes and an
antikinetochore antibody. The assay involved the chemical
or radiation induced formation of micronuclei in the
lymphocytes and the use of the antibody to determine
whether the micronuclei contained centromeres, an
indicator of high potential for aneuploidy. The au—
thors conclude that the assay described in this publi-
cation can discriminate between aneuploidogens and
clastogens and may allow a more rapid identification
of chemicals with aneuploidy inducing potential.

that whole blood cultures may be considered a better

Aneuploidy induction by chemicals and ionizing ra-

The DNA in the nuclei and micronuclei were counter-
stained with propidium—iodide. The frequency of mi—
cronuclei, the fraction of kinetochore positive and negative
micronuclei per cell, and the fraction of kinetochore
positive micronuclei were determined using an immu—
nofluorescence technique. Cultures of CHE-O cells, a
clone isolated from CCHE/27 cells, were irradiated
with 0 or 15Gy gamma rays. Surviving cells were
stained with propidium-iodide and the ﬂuorescence
distribution of the chromosomes was determined by a

the in vitro micronuclei kinetochore assay appears to
be a useful technique for distinguishing between mi-

Traditional karyotyping techniques were used to

The dissolution of aerosol 57Co304 particles was in-
vestigated by exposing baboon alveolar macrophages
(AM) to the particles and immobilizing the AM in
alginate macrobeads crosslinked with Ca2+ ions. The
rate obtained with immobilized AM is very close to
the rates previously found for adherent AM in culture.
Moreover, AM that had phagocytosed PuO2 particles
before immobilization by the same method gave a
mean daily dissolution rate close to that obtained in
vivo with baboons. It is also demonstrated that immo—
bilization did not affect AM viability. The present
method of immobilization seems very promising com—
pared to conventional methods because it facilitates
manipulation, allows the use of cells at a high density
in a small volume, and gives results for particles with
a very low dissolution rate.

gill sunfish were used to study cytotoxic effects for a
series of mercury compounds. The in vitro cytotoxic—
ity was similar to that observed in a 48—h LC50 in vivo
acute toxicity assay with rainbow trout. Using induc-
tion of micronuclei as an indicator of genetic damage,
the organomercurials, but not mercuric chloride, were
noted to be clastogenic to the BG/F cells.

membrane characteristics as indices of in vitro
toxicity. The Toxicologist 10(1):328(Abstr. 1309).

The cellular plasma membrane is one potential site of
action for chemically induced cytotoxicity. The ob—
jective of this study was to evaluate the relative sensi-
tivity of several indicators of plasma membrane func-
tion as indicators of in vitro cytotoxicity. Plasma
membrane parameters examined include assessments
of cell shape, membrane fluidity, LDH release and
ability to exclude a ﬂuorescent dye. The development
of mechanistically oriented cytotoxicity indices should
be valuable for establishing strategies for toxicologi—
cal evaluation.

toxicity assays. Potential alternatives to the draize
ocular allergy test. Cell. Biol. Toxicol. 1(1):55-65.

A short-term cytotoxicity assay carried out in multiwell
test plates and a supplementary colony forming assay
are both useful for screening and range finding of
toxic concentrations of test agents. The highest toler-
ated dose (HTD), a concentration at which only mini-
mal morphological changes were observed, was des-
ignated as endpoint in the assay. Epithelial rabbit cornea
cells, murine fibroblasts, Chinese hamster lung cells,
human hepatoma cells and mouse macrophage cul-
tures were used as targets. An ID50 of colony forma—
tion was used as a quantitative corroborating test. This
easily reproducible, rapid in vitro test is cost-effective
and can be used for preliminary large scale screening
of potential toxicants.

oil ingredients for cosmetics using cell culture sys-
tem. Nippon Koshohin Kagakkaishi 13(4):194-202.

This article (in Japanese) describes cytotoxicity tests
for the safety evaluation of 42 oil ingredients for cos-
metics carried out in vitro by using cultured epithelial
cells derived from human skin (JTC-17). The cells
were exposed to the test substances which were dis—
persed in the cultured medium using an ultrasonic
emulsion method, and cell viability was estimated by
Neutral Red dye uptake. Comparison was made be—
tween the results of in vitro tests and primary irritancy
tests on rabbit skin. Though not all of the primary skin
irritants show toxicity to the cultured cells, the in vitro
cytotoxicity test described here seems to be simple
and useful as a first screening test for primary skin
irritants of oil ingredients for cosmetics.

The in vitro cytotoxicities of 59 chemicals, expressed as

duced the final cellular protein content of test cultures
by 50% in comparison with appropriate solvent control
cultures) and obtained using murine 3T3-L1 cells and
the FRAME kenacid blue method, were compared with
rat oral and mouse ip LD50' A better in vivo/in vitro
correlation was obtained for the chemicals with mouse
ip LD50 (r = 0.80) than with rat oral LD50 (r = 0.76). The
best correlation was found when the most toxic values
were used in the comparison (r = 0.81).

In vitro chemosensitivity of blast cells from 19 pa—

gated. A semiautomated P—iodonitrotetrazolium violet

able cells to cleave piodonitrotetrazolium violet into a
red formazan derivative and a short-term antimeta—
bolic assay based on the uptake inhibition of [3H]—
thymidine were compared in terms of their ability to
predict clinical outcome. Both methods were able to
discriminate between sensitive and resistant patients
by in vitro cytosine arabinoside testing. A good cor-
relation was demonstrated between the results of the
two different methodological approaches, validating
the recently described INT sensitivity test.

Comparison of tetrazolium colorimetric and

Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 24(5):295-301.

A colorimetric assay for assessing chemosensitivity
with the advantages of safety, cost, and simplicity was
previously described and relies on the ability of living
cells to reduce a soluble tetrazolium salt, 3—4,5-
dimethylthiazol—2,5—diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MMT),
into an insoluble formazan precipitate. A modified
MTT assay for chemosensitivity screening is described
but further modifications seem necessary to improve
the sensitivity and decrease the problem of cell loss
after washing.

radiation or drugs. Leuk. Res. 13(10):943-7.

A novel dye exclusion assay based on differential
staining of fixed cells has been evaluated using the
MOLT4 (T-lymphoblastic leukaemia) and DAUDI
(Burkitt lymphoma) cell lines. Reproducible differen-
tial staining was found with fixed samples kept for up
to 2 months. Reproducible dose—response data were
obtained with cells treated with radiation or drugs and
assayed after 4 days in culture. This ability to fix cells
prior to measurement of viability is of general use
particularly where time constraints prevent
haemocytometer counting. More specifically, it may
have potential use in the field of chemosensitivity
testing particularly where large sample numbers re-
quire rapid processing.

response to radiation. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 56(5):846.

The basic principle of the MTT assay is the reduction
by viable cells of a tetrazolium salt producing formazan
crystals. These are solubilized and the resultant ab—
sorbance measured. The MTT assay was evaluated
with the aim of measuring the radiosensitivity of new
xenograft cell lines. The assay has advantages in
terms of speed and simplicity over other assays mea—
suring cell response and providing the cell conditions
and time of assay are optimized for each cell line. It is
a useful additional test system.

and pharmacology of chemical agents. The advantage
of the test described here is that it uses adequate target
cells and that it evaluates both the ability of the test
chemical to penetrate several cellular layers as well as
the ability to interfere with cellular function. The end-
points are cell viability and cell metabolism, which
are determined by neutral red uptake and MTT reduc-
tion, respectively. This test system might be in its
present stage a supplement to current tests which may
replace in vivo irritation tests like the Draize test.

The ability of two in vitro techniques, consisting of
the FRAME cytotoxicity test and calculating the soft-
ness of the metal, to predict in vivo toxicity of metal—
lic compounds was evaluated. The FRAME test con-
sists of incubating the test compound with mouse-3T3-
Ll fibroblasts and determining the concentration re-
quired to reduce the cellular protein concentration by
50 percent. Metal softness of the metal ion in the test
compound is calculated from the values of the coordi-
nate bond energies for forming the iodide and ﬂuo—
ride. The authors conclude that of the two methods,
the FRAME cytotoxicity test is the better predictor of
in vivo toxicity.

was measured. The in vitro data derived from these
tests corroborates the animal and limited clinical data
available for the aminoglycosides.

A number of surfactants were studied for their effects
on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), protein content, and
de novo synthesis in a murine epidermal cell line
(HEL/30). Protein synthesis, evaluated as [3H]leucine
incorporation into cell proteins, was a more sensitive
endpoint of toxicity than LDH leakage or protein con—
tent. Comparative surfactant toxicity followed the
general order of cationic > anionic > nonionic > am—
photeric. A good rank correlation was observed be—
tween their relative toxicity produced in vitro and the
eye irritation produced in vivo in the Draize test. This
sensitive and reproducible in vitro method may offer a
means for screening potentially irritating water-soluble
chemicals such as surfactants to quantify their toxic-

ity.

In an effort to find alternative approaches to animal
testing, cells (rat alveolar macrophages, hamster tra-
cheal epithelial cells, rat lung fibroblasts) of the respi-
ratory tract have been evaluated for cytotoxic and
metabolic changes after exposure to fibers and par—
ticles. Release of superoxide from alveolar macroph-
ages, release of 51Chromium in hamster tracheal epi—
thelial (HTE) cells, and an increase in the ratio of
collagen to non—collagen protein in the cell line (RL-
82) of rat lung fibroblasts are taken as indicators of
the fibrogenic potential of minerals. Results suggest
that a battery of in vitro assays can be used to screen
the capability of minerals to elicit cell damage and in—
ﬂammatory changes in the respiratory tract.

tions. Altern. Methods Toxicol. 7(In Vitro ToxicolzNew

A long—term bone marrow culture system developed
in the laboratory should serve as an excellent substrate
for cytotoxicity determinations. Nylon filtration screen
is inoculated with bone marrow stromal cells and sus-
pended in ﬂasks containing liquid medium. A second
inoculation of hematopoietic cells is applied after ap-
proximately 70% of the mesh spaces are spanned by
developing stroma. A three-dimensional growth pat-
tern is observed and extensive hematopoietic coloni-
zation occurs in the stromal interstices. These cul-
tures are easily manipulable and support multilineage
hematopoietic expression. Assessment of cytotoxic
effects can be performed by phenotypic and/or hema—
topoietic progenitor analysis of the adherent zone. It
may also be possible to test the effects of potential
therapeutic regimens on a patient’s bone marrow cells
in vitro before they are used in vivo.

applied compounds. J. Pharm. Sci. 79(4):312-6.

In order to obtain more insight into the potential skin
toxicity of penetration enhancers, they were adminis-
tered to cultured human keratinocytes and fibroblasts
and the following cytotoxicity assays were performed:
inhibition of the proliferation of fibroblasts and
keratinocytes; inhibition of collagen contraction by
fibroblasts; and cell morphology changes in confluent
cultures of fibroblasts and keratinocytes. An obvious
advantage of the in vitro model presented here is its
immediate availability and reproducibility, which al-
lows for the comparison of a large series of topical
agents with respect to their cell toxicity under stan—
dardized conditions. However, this single-cell model
lacks some of the properties found in intact skin, such
as the stratum corneum barrier, and interactions be-
tween keratinocytes and other cells, such as Langer—
hans cells. Hence, extrapolation of these data to in
vivo should be done with caution.

The current strategy for the design of cytotoxicity

ity of in vitro tests to fulfill expectations for alterna-
tive methods to animal testing. Past experience with
in vitro and short-term tests for mutagenicity indicate
that it is not wise to look for one single supertest. The
relevance of an integrated approach must be aimed
directly at the organisms that may be exposed.

The application of a modified colorimetric assay for

reported. Using four mammalian monolayer cell types
(swine kidney. African green monkey kidney, Madin
Darbin canine kidney and bovine embryonic lung
cells), the influence of the mycotoxins zearalenone
and deoxynivalenol on the cellular methylthi-
azoltetrazolium (MTT)-cleavage activity was evalu—
ated after different toxin exposure times. The yellow
tetrazolium salt is converted by mitochondrial en-
zymes of metabolically active cells into purple formazan
products. These crystals were dissolved in dimethyl
sulphoxide to obtain a homogeneous solution, the
optical density of which was suitable for precise spec-
trophotometric measurement by a plate reader. The re-
sults indicate that monolayers are useful targets in
the MTT assay for investigating the action of myco—
toxins and for performing comparative studies in
mammalian cells.

Four assays that may serve as components of a battery
of alternatives to the conventional Draize test are de—
scribed. The exfoliative cytology assay is a refine-
ment of the Draize test that may provide a more sensi-
tive and more objective endpoint. The macrophage
migration assay addresses the inﬂammatory aspects of
the physiological response to irritation. The uridine
uptake inhibition assay uses a quantitative, reversible
endpoint to detect the short—term action of agents on
cell membranes and cell phosphorylative potential.
Finally, the cytological assay serves as a rapid, easily
performed general indicator of cytotoxic action. The
two latter assays have been demonstrated to correlate
very well with Draize test results and with each other
for a wide range of test agents.

A rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive method was devel-
oped for measuring the cellular protein content of
adherent and suspension cultures in 96-well microtiter
plates. The method relies on protein binding of the
dye sulforhodamine B with determination of optical
density in a computer-interfaced, 96-well microtiter
plate reader. The sulforhodamine B assay provides a
colorimetric endpoint that is nondestructive, indefi-
nitely stable, and visible to the naked eye. It provides
a sensitive measure of drug-induced cytotoxicity, is
useful in quantitating clonogenicity, and is well suited
to high-volume, automated drug screening.
Sulforhodamine B fluoresces strongly with laser exci-
tation at 488 nm and can be measured quantitatively at
the single—cell level by static fluorescence cytometry.

Screening of in vitro cytotoxicity by the adhesive
film test. Biomaterials 11(2):]33-7.

The adhesive film test is proposed as a screening method
to predict potential cytotoxicity of biomaterials. This
in vitro test utilizes a sterile strip of acrylate-based
medical adhesive as an anchorage substrate in cyto—
toxicity studies. The adhesive film allows direct fixa-
tion of test samples to the base of the petri dish,
ensuring close contact between sample and cells. The
test is based on the principle that toxic components
present in the test material will readily leach out into
the culture medium and adversely affect the local cell
population. The main advantage of the adhesive film
test is that a viable cell population can be added di—
rectly to the test plate and after an incubation period
of 24 hours, the cellular response can be recorded as
either cytotoxic or cytocompatible. Microscopic ex—
amination can be followed by quantifying the results
using a micrometer to measure cellular attachment
areas, migration distances and zones of inhibition. In
addition, the adhesive film used to attach the test samples
is shown to support extensive fibroblast growth and
attachment to its surface and hence can also function

rinated aliphatic compounds. The rankings were com-
pared with the maximum tolerated doses for each spe-
cies. Significant correlations between the rankings were
obtained. These data support the use of isolated hepa—
tocytes for screening of chemicals for relative toxic-

1ty.

Neutral red in medium was absorbed and concentrated
in lysosomes of cultured rat and human hepatocytes.
Uptake was proportional to the concentration of the
neutral red solution and the numbers of viable liver
cells. Neutral red can be extracted from lysosomes for
quantitative measurement of hepatocyte viability and
cytotoxicity of xenobiotics. The cytotoxic effects of
dimethylnitrosamine and aflatoxin B1 were examined
by the neutral red assay on rat and human hepatocyte
cultures and found to be dependent on dose and time
of exposures. Compared with the lactate dehydroge—
nase leakage test, the neutral red assay was simpler and
more sensitive in determining the viability and cytotox—
icity of xenobiotics in primary cultures of hepatocytes.

tometric absorbance and cell numbers was not com-
pletely linear. this method could be used effectively as
a simple preliminary assay to test for the toxicity of
dental drugs and materials.

Developmental toxicity

Low-level exposure to lead impairs longitudinal growth
in children and in experimental animals. The proposed
mechanisms include decreased osteocalcin secretion
in response to l alpha,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 and de-
creased response to insulin-like growth factor-I. The

interaction of lead, 1 alpha,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3, and
insulin-like growth factor—I was investigated in an os—
teoblast-like cell line from rat osteosarcoma, ROS 17/
2.8. The data are consistent with a toxic effect of lead
on osteoblastic function and the cellular responses to
1 alpha,25-(OH)2 Vitamin D3 and insulin-like growth
factor-I. This interaction may be relevant to impaired
childhood growth at low levels of lead exposure.

(GRA&I) Issue 04: NTIS/AD-A2l3 868/3.

The goal of this project was to develop and validate
the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay Xenopus (FETAX).
FETAX is a 96 hour whole embryo bioassay designed
to rapidly assess the developmental toxicity of pure
compounds or complex mixtures. The four specific
objectives of this study were: 1) validate FETAX us—
ing direct—acting compounds of known mammalian
developmental toxicity, 2) develop and validate an in
vitro metabolic activation system using rat liver mi-
crosomes, 3) explore the use of three carrier solvents
which will help solubilize non—polar compounds and,
4) develop an atlas of malformations which will assist
users in performing FETAX. Endpoints of FETAX
are mortality, malformation and growth inhibition.

teratogenesis in neural primary cultures and cell
lines. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 8(2):143-50.

To establish inherent potential for the induction of
neural tube defects, the ability of selected anticonvulsant
agents to interfere with cell division has been estab-
lished in vitro using an antiproliferative assay in clonal
cell lines and a cytotoxicity assay using primary cul-
tures of cerebral cortex neurons at different stages of
development. It is concluded that assessment of
antiproliferative activity of anticonvulsant drugs may
be one criterion for identification of teratogenic po—
tential during neurulation.

Interest in non-mammalian alternatives to in vivo ani-

However, few of these alternative screening systems
have been critically evaluated or validated. In order to
characterize such tests, there is a need for reproducible

paper presents this scoring system and demonstrates
its application in developmental toxicity evaluations.

and E. M Johnson. 1989. Hydra test modification to
identify developmental hazards among volatile liq-
uids and gases. Teratology 39(5):483.

As opposed to the mammalian test, the hydra test is
much less costly, is more rapid to conduct, and re-
quires only a very small amount of test chemical. The
test can now be conducted in vials outfitted with teﬂon—
lined screw-caps to provide a closed system from which
samples can be taken for analytical purposes. The
conclusion that FC-l32B, a highly volatile liquid, was
not uniquely sensitive to the mammalian conceptus
was supported by the results of a preliminary test in
the rat.

ods: development and use of two in vitro models
for endocrine studies]. Schweiz. Arch. Tierheilkd.
131(9):537-45.

Most endocrinological studies are normally performed
on several animal groups. In order to overcome some
of the drawbacks associated with in vivo experimenta—
tion, a method was developed using two in vitro mod-
els by means of which could be studied on the tissues
from the same animal, (1) function and structure of
the hypothalamus, and (2) function and structure of
isolated pituitary cells. Using these models can con-
siderably reduce the number of animals needed for the
studies, replace the in vivo by the in vitro experiments
and refine the methods avoiding, among others, the
extrapolation of results. This publication is written in
French.

1987. Comparison of in vitro cell toxicity with in
vivo eye irritation. Mol. Toxicol. 1(4):561-70.

The cytotoxicity potentials of 26 different cosmetic
ingredients were ranked for each of four in vitro test
and compared with the in vivo eye irritation in guinea
pigs (Draize test) after application of 5% or 2.5%
solutions of the same test batches. Strong irritants
could be easily detected by most of the in vitro tests,

516

but the neutral red uptake assay was the only one that
was able to distinguish the minimally irritating test
agents from strong irritants as well as from nonirritants.
Other in vitro tests considered were cell detachment
from culture dish, growth inhibition, and membrane
permeability.

Bracher, M., C. Faller, J. Spengler, and C. A. Reinhardt.

1988. Comparison of in vitro cell toxicity with in
vivo eye irritation. Mol. Toxicol. 1(4):561-70.

The effects of 26 different cosmetic ingredients were
assessed by four endpoints indicative of qualitatively
and quantitatively different cytotoxicities: (1) neutral
red uptake reduction after 24 hours of treatment (NR—
90 and NR-50); (2) cell detachment from culture dish
after 4 hours of treatment (CD-25); (3) growth inhibi-
tion after 48 hours of treatment (GI-50); and (4) mem-
brane permeability measured by fluorescent dye re-
tention (ﬂuorescence shift FS—25) and dye exclusion
(viability ratio VR—25). The cytotoxicity potentials of
the test agents were ranked for each in vitro test and
compared with the in vivo eye irritation in guinea pigs
(Draize test) after application of 5 or 2.5% (wt/vol.)
solutions of the same test batches. The neutral red
uptake assay was the only one that was able to distin-
guish the minimally irritating test agents from strong
irritants as well as from nonirritants. At least two of

_ the other cell tests (CD-25, GI—50, FS-25, and VR-25)

had to be considered to allow an adequate interpreta—
tion of in vitro cytotoxicity.

Bruner, L. H. and R. D. Parker. 1990. Evaluation of six

in vitro alternatives for ocular irritancy testing.
The Toxicologist 10(1):258(Abstr. 1029).

Six in vitro assays were evaluated to determine if any
are useful as screening procedures in ocular safety
assessments. The six assays evaluated included the
Microtox Assay, Light Addressable Potentiometric Sensor,
Neutral Red Assay, Total Protein Assay, Tetrahymena
thermophila motility assay, and the EYTEX System.
There was a significant correlation between the in
vivo irritancy and the in vitro data for all the tests
except the EYTEX System. These results suggest it
may be possible to classify materials into broad irritancy
categories and thereby use some of these assays as
pre—screens prior to in vivo confirmation in the ocular
safety assessment process.

The reSponse of human subconjunctival fibroblasts to a
variety of pharmacological agents was evaluated utiliz-
ing a novel in vitro wound assay and a separate pro-
liferation assay. The authors conclude that the wound
assay is well suited for rapid screening of drugs for
their effect on fibroblast morphology, motility, and pro-
liferation, and that colchicine and cytochalasin B, in
doses well below those documented to produce ocular
toxicity, are effective in inhibiting directed migration
and proliferation of subconjunctival fibroblasts in vitro.
Differences in mechanism, onset of action, therapeutic
range, and cytotoxicity of drugs could be exploited in
controlling ocular fibroblast behavior in vivo.

Glutamic acid (GA) content was measured in cultured
Hep G2 cells, after treatment of the cells with test
compounds. Results with 37 chemicals were com-
pared with their respective rabbit eye irritation data.
The xenobiotics were applied to the cells for 4 hours
at 5 different concentrations. The cells were then in-
cubated for 15 minutes with tritiated GA and GA
uptake inhibition was measured. A linear correlation
coefficient of r = 0.66 was found between the in vitro
and the mean corneal opacity scores. However, r =
0.81 was found when the in vitro results were com-
pared with range-finding scores, indicating that a closer
relationship exists between cytotoxicity and the latter.

The objective of this study was to determine whether

tion studies could be reduced and still maintain cor-
rect conclusions regarding the eye irritation of various
substances. An alternative to the Draize scoring sys-
tem was used which involves measurement of increases
in corneal thickness accompanying eye irritation. The
corneal swelling technique can provide statistically-
analyzable eye irritancy data that will quantitate irritancy
potential from three rabbit subsets rather than the tra-
ditional six-animal data sets.

The goal of this project was to determine how accu—
rate the EYTEX data were when compared to the
standard in vivo eye irritation data (Draize test) and
also for inter— and intralaboratory variability. Two
assays employed for this purpose were the Standard
Assay and the Membrane Partition Assay. The ap—
proach was to evaluate the chemicals at concentra—
tions comparable to potential human exposures. In
Phase I of the project, six toxicology laboratories were
contracted to participate in an external evaluation of
the Standard EYTEX System. In Phase II, the EYTEX
System was used to evaluate a select group of military
compounds and compare the results with Draize scores.
The data and equivalence values indicate that the
EYTEX System is a suitable prescreening tool, and a
need exists for the development of a broader data base.

The in vitro red blood cell assay (RBC assay) allows
the estimation of irritation potentials of tensides and
detergents. The estimation is based on the differentia-
tion between cell membrane lysis and cell protein
denaturation. All data were compared with in vivo
data on eye irritancies. The good correlation of in
Vivo and in vitro data (r = .806, p < .0001) allows one
to predict eye irritation. The RBC assay is an inex—
pensive, rapid, irritancy screening test that provides
reliable results with good reproducibility. The test
helps to reduce or even avoid animal testing in this
application.

In the field of in vitro toxicology, attention is being

alternative mouse embryonic fibroblast (3T3-L1) cells
were cultured. The cells were incubated at 370C in
95% air/5% CO2 for 4 days until conﬂuent, the me-
dium replaced with medium containing neutral red,
and after 3 hours the neutral red medium was re-
moved. The test was carried out within 1 hour. At the
end of the treatment period (usually 1 minute), the test
sample was removed and neutral red destain solution
was added. The neutral red released by the treated
cells was measured and correlated with the known in
vivo irritancy to the eye.

tion and by dye exclusion. The hen’s egg test was
performed on the chorioallantoic membrane of 10-
day-old chicks. A good correlation between the four
alternative in vitro tests and the in vivo irritation data
was obtained which allowed a prediction of irritation
potential of unknown test chemical based on cell tox-
icity. The hen’s egg test was shown to be of limited
value.

Ocular irritancy may be predicted in vitro using nor-

the cell protein or neutral red assays. Alkalinity or
acidity of test agents cannot be predicted with cell
cultures, and these properties of test agents should,
therefore, be measured by titration. For the nonalkaline
and nonacidic agents, these assay systems correlated
well with Draize scores and irritancy evaluations.

We have compared the in vitro cellular toxicity and

In vitro, the cellular toxicity was estimated on Chi-
nese hamster lung fibroblasts (V79) using a cell mor—
tality test and a cell growth inhibition test. In vivo,
each surfactant was applied directly to the cornea of
six albino rabbits. The results suggest that the use of
cell culture tests as pre-screening systems to measure
eye irritation potency of surfactants could be a reli—
able alternative method in order to reduce the use of
the Draize rabbit eye test and can provide a better
knowledge of the irritative process.

There was a close correlation between the cytotoxicity
in RC cells in vitro and the Draize score in vivo in
response to the chemicals. The data suggest that the
cytotoxicity test in vitro using primary RC cells may be
useful as a substitute for the Draize eye irritancy test.

VOIUme 33, Number 3 Summer 1991

Toxicological studies using primary cultured hepato-
cytes were reviewed in Japanese. Primary cultures of
mature hepatocytes retain many liver functions and
various hormonal responses for long periods. Toxico—
logical studies using primary cultured hepatocytes show
a high correlation with some in vivo studies. Some of
the shortcomings such as lack of enzyme production
stability are being worked out. It is suggested that in
the future it may be possible to culture hepatocytes for
long periods or subculture them and still have them
maintain liver function. Not only rodent hepatocytes
but also human hepatocytes may become more useful
for toxicological assessments and screening of drugs
used for treating liver diseases.

The effect of Zn-induced metallothionein on the tox—
icity, uptake, and subcellular distribution of cadmium
was examined in rat primary hepatocyte cultures and
compared to results obtained earlier in this laboratory
from intact animals. Cytotoxicity was assessed by
enzyme leakage, intracellular potassium loss, and cel-
lular glutathione content. These results indicate that
cultured hepatocytes are a model for examining
metallothionein—induced tolerance to cadmium
hepatotoxicity.

hepatocytes. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol.. 101(1):106—
13.

Primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes were incu-
bated with carbon tetrachloride and/or chloroform. Agent-
dependent alterations in hepatocyte functions were as-
sessed by measuring (1) [3H]choline incorporation
into phosphatidylcholine (endoplasmic reticulum), (2)
MTT (tetrazolium salt) reduction (mitochondria), and
(3) AST release into medium (plasma membrane). These
effects of carbon tetrachloride and/or chloroform on
liver cell functions in vitro are consistent with liver
alterations observed in vivo. Therefore, primary cul-
tures of adult rat hepatocytes may be an appropriate
model in vitro to assess the hepatotoxic potential of
agents alone or in combination.

This report describes the production of polyclonal an—
tibodies against microgram quantities of a weakly im-
munogenic tumor—associated protein of canine origin.
The technique employs the subcutaneous implantation
of nitrocellulose electroblot strips without the use of
adjuvant. The method is simple, appears reliable, can
be used to improve antigen purity, and is applicable
for either polyclonal or monoclonal antibody produc-
tion in different host species. In addition, because
traditional adjuvants are not required with this system,
severe inﬂammatory responses and associated animal
discomfort are reduced.

ToxicolzNew Dir.): 141-9.

Many approaches for primary immunotoxicity assess—
ment include a limited evaluation of in vitro immune
function. For screening purposes, and where little data
exist concerning the toxicity of the chemical or com—
pound of interest, in vivo exposure in conjunction
with the in vitro immune function assays is preferable
to in vitro exposure. Immune function assays with
appropriate sensitivity and comprehension in terms of
the cell types, interactions and functions they assess,
are best suited for screening purposes. Two such
assays are the antibody plaque assay and the cytotoxic
T lymphocyte assay. These assays provide important
measures of functional competence in the two major
branches (cellular and humoral) of the immune re—
sponse. They are antigen-driven responses and immu—
nization with the appropriate antigen can be either in
vivo or in vitro. For a more detailed understanding
and dissection of mechanisms associated with chemi-
cally induced immunotoxicity, in vitro systems may
provide advantages over in vivo models.

Macrophage chemiluminescence was evaluated as a

activity of 17 different chemicals. Elicited mouse
peritoneal macrophages were exposed to the chemi-
cals in vitro, and chemiluminescence was measured in
response to an opsonized yeast stimulus. Macrophage

capable of identifying many known immunomodulatory

ous Ocul. Toxicol. 8(2):227—40.

Human epidermal keratinocytes were prelabeled with
(3H)choline and then treated with four surfactants.
Media were assayed for release of labeled choline
metabolites. Irritancy of these surfactants was deter—
mined in two animal test systems: the guinea pig im-
mersion assay and the guinea pig dermal irritancy
assay. The rank order response for the choline release
assay was analogous to the rank order irritancy in
animal skin. This positive correlation suggests that
this system merits further investigation as an alterna-
tive in vitro assay for human skin irritancy.

Gajjar, L. and D. J. Benford. 1987. Irritancy testing in

(9 refs.).

An in vitro system for assessing skin and eye irritancy
was evaluated. The system used a keratinocyte line
derived from explant cultures of rat sublingual epithe-
lium. Cytotoxicity was indicated by the cells releas-
ing alkaline-phosphatase and by determining the ex-
tent of uptake of neutral—red and kena—blue dyes. Although
there are insufficient in vivo skin irritancy data to
obtain a meaningful comparison, the test data corre—
late well with data obtained in other in vitro and in
vivo tests used to assess eye irritancy.

Recent research trends have been oriented towards the

rate of diffusion of different anionic surfactants through
both cellulose acetate and collagen membranes are
described. A correlation between results of diffusion
through the protein membrane and results published

A cytotoxicity assay based on the uptake of Neutral
Red by HeLa cells was investigated as an in vitro
screen for assessing the irritancy potential of paren-
teral formulations. Three irritants and two nonirritants
were examined for cytotoxic effects in this system.
The ranking of the injectables tested, in order of de-
creasing cytotoxic effects, correlated with both previ-
ously reported qualitative in vitro data and their re-
ported irritancy when administered to man. The HeLa
cell/Neutral Red cytotoxicity assay may provide an
alternative to animal studies for the assessment of the
irritancy potential of parenteral formulations during
the preliminary stages of their development.

and complex mixture toxicity by measuring the extent
of cellular adherence to a foreign substrate, phagocy-
tosis of inert particles, release of lysosomal or cyto-
plasmic enzymes, metabolic alterations such as changes
in oxygen consumption or free radical production, or
changes in cytokine production. The author concludes
that when they are performed carefully, alveolar macro-
phage assays can be used to predict pulmonary toxicity.

vitro effects of fibrous and nonfibrous silicon ni-
tride on bovine pulmonary macrophages. Environ.
Res. 50(2):279-288.

Bovine pulmonary macrophages were exposed in vitro
to a fibrous silicon nitride, nonfibrous (milled) silicon
nitride comminuted from the fibrous powder, alpha—
quartz (an active control), or glass beads (an inert
control). Functional evaluation, biochemical studies
(increased release of lactate dehydrogenase and acid
phosphatase, consistent with both cell membrane and
lysosome lysis, and depression of total protein levels,
suggesting significant impairment of cellular synthetic
processes), and scanning electron microscopy were
used to assess the effects.

rat liver, primary rat hepatocyte cultures, hepatic
rat microsomes and the whole rat. Toxicol. In Vitro
3(3):167-74.

The metabolism of the aromatic amine, 1,3—
diaminobenzene was studied in vitro by use of the
perfused rat liver, primary rat hepatocyte cultures and
hepatic rat microsomes. The metabolites formed were
compared with urinary metabolites excreted by the rat
in vivo. The results show that in addition to the
metabolites that can be detected in the urine in vivo,
several other derivatives, including glucuronic acid
conjugates are formed by the rat liver. The results
suggest that primary rat hepatocyte cultures are the
preferred model system in metabolic studies in vitro.

Metabolite analysis by gas chromatography-mass spec-
trometry of supernatant and cell extracts from hepato-
cyte cultures exposed to 2,3,4-trimethylpentane for
four hours indicated the presence of three metabolites:
2,3,4—trimethyl-l-pentanol, 2,3,4—trimethyl-2—pentanol,
and 2,3,4—trimethyl-l—pentanoic acid. This study indi-
cates that primary hepatocyte suspension cultures pro-
vide a useful system for rapidly identifying liver me—
tabolites of selected test compounds.

UMR-106—01, an osteoblast-like cell line, was used in
an effort to determine the mechanism by which the
accumulation of iron or aluminum might cause meta-
bolic bone disease. The results indicate that osteo-
blast-like cells have a single class of membrane recep-
tors for transferrin and that the regulation of transferrin
receptor expression in UMR-106-01 cells is similar to

that in other cell types. The uptake of iron and gallium
via the Tf—receptor complex can affect osteoblast pro-
liferation, and such a mechanism may contribute to
the bone cell toxicity of various metals.

in an energy-dependent paraquat-accumulating cell
line. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 274(2):366-74.

In vitro screening of potential antidotes that act by
blocking paraquat uptake requires a cell line that ac-
cumulates paraquat by an energy—dependent mecha-
nism. Various lymphoblastoid cell lines were screened
until one was found that accumulated paraquat by an
energy-dependent mechanism. During study of this
cell line, a marked resistance to paraquat developed in
a clone. The resistance was associated with a reduc-
tion in NADPH reductase activity, confirming the original
report (using microsomal preparations) that intracel-
lular reduction of paraquat occurs primarily by this
enzyme. Thus, this cell line will be useful for study-
ing other toxins where the involvement of NADPH
reductase is suspected, but not proven.

It is concluded that cryopreservation of certain stages

sages.

Review of annual reports of the numbers of animals
used in testing in the United States, the United King-
dom, and Japan shows a continuing reduction in the
numbers for all species. Multiple in vitro systems
have been developed for screening/testing for eye and
skin irritation, skin sensitization, teratology, and other
endpoints and a scientific consensus has been formed
on requirements and process for validation. However,
the use of these test systems in place of existing in
vivo tests is minimal. At the same time, innovative
designs have been developed (and are in wide use) for
in vivo tests which reduce both the numbers and the
pain and distress of animals used in testing. Progress
and dialogue continue on modification of both US.
and international requirements and guidelines for test—
ing, and for defining an “approval” process for alter-
natives and innovations.

The results indicate that under the experimental con-
ditions used and within the limits of the data analyses,
the assays perform similarly. Because the sulforhodamine
B assay has practical advantages for large—scale screening,
however, it has been adopted for routine use in the
NCI in vitro antitumor screen.

not only to identify new model organisms for studying
more optimally those life processes we know some-
thing about, but also to discover entirely new biologi-
cal principles, processes, and products. Increased em—
phasis on the need to preserve the diversity of life also
requires more knowledge of the comparative biology
of processes such as reproduction, growth, defense
mechanisms, and nutrition. There is a critical need of
commercial biotechnology for basic functional infor-
mation on more species, especially microorganisms
and plants.

Zbinden, G. 1990. Alternative methods, the present

and future. Therapie 45(4):347-50.

This paper, written in French, states that alternative
methods are widely used in fundamental biological
research. Among 6,649 papers given at the Federation
of American Societies for Experimental Biology 1989
meeting, nearly 60% deal with experimental data ob—
tained without the use of live animals. Alternative
methods are less frequently utilized in industrial toxi-
cology. The reason for this discrepancy is discussed
as well as the efforts made to reduce the numbers of
animals for acute toxicity studies (LDso) and cutane—
ous and eye tolerance. Present scientific developments
as well as the possible agreement by regulatory agen-
cies of the newly developed tests are presented. In
spite of the increasing acceptance of alternative meth—
ods, large numbers of animals are still used. The rea-
sons for this situation are analyzed, as are the efforts
made to encourage research for the replacement of
animals in programs traditionally based on animal
experimentation.

As part of the third UKEMS collaborative trial, ICI
Central Toxicology Laboratory (CTL) tested three chemi-
cals in a microwell adaptation of the L5178Y gene
mutation assay using the thymidine kinase (tk) locus.
Cofactors for metabolic activation were optimized prior
to testing the chemicals under differing expression
times and S9 levels. The results for zero hour sur—
vival, relative total growth and mutant frequency were
subjected to extensive statistical analyses. It was con—
cluded that the methods described produce a robust
and reliable assay and that for routine use a single
expression time and S9 level are sufficient, provided
true independent replicates are used.

The concept of combining several histidine-dependent

has been applied to the microtitre ﬂuctuation test. The
activity of five mutagens was determined in strains
TA97, TA98, TAlOO, and TA102 individually as well
as in a SIMULTEST mixture. All five compounds
were mutagenic in the SIMULTEST, demonstrating
the utility of this time and labor-saving approach of
combining strains for testing with this method. The

titatively comparable to those of the SIMULTEST
salmonella/microsome plate test.

T-lymphocytes stored in liquid nitrogen and returned

the same sensitivity as freshly—isolated T—cells to kill-

efficiencies and frequencies of 6—thioguanine-resistant
cells as did the corresponding populations that had been
assayed directly without freezing. Use of these proce—
dures should facilitate investigation of the frequency
and kinds of mutations induced in the HPRT gene of
peripheral blood T—lymphocytes in vivo and in vitro.

The use of short term testing batteries to predict the
mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of industrial chemi-
cals and the use of mutagenic screens and teratogen—
esis were reviewed. The author concludes that short
term mutagenicity tests are of value in predicting risk
to humans, but recommends caution in interpreting in
vitro mutagenicity test results applied to industrial
compounds, and that in vitro activity be correlated to
in vivo response by comparing results at similar end—
points, as well as the nature of specific compounds

different mechanisms of nephrotoxic effect. The au—
thors conclude that alpha—methylglucose is a sensitive

Evidence was offered of ultrastructural changes in
response to very low dosages of ionic cadmium in

induced events resulting in human proximal tubule
dysfunction. According to the authors, these studies
clearly indicate that very low cadmium concentra—
tions, below those eliciting proximal tubule cell death
or destruction of tight junctions and the epithelial sheet,
elicit subtle fine structural changes coupled with alter—
ations in transport function. The in vitro system used
mimics many of the well defined cadmium elicited
responses reported in vivo systems.

A study was conducted to observe alterations in cel-
lular viability and fine structure in response to expo-
sure to cadmium as cadmium-chloride in vitro. The
human proximal tubule cell culture model, as used in
this study, offered a method of identifying the early or
acute effects of cadmium in the human kidney. Cells
treated with each of the cadmium doses exhibited some
evidence of cell death. Cadmium treated tubule cells
demonstrated fine structural alterations including con-
densation of nuclear chromatin, loss of microvilli structure,
disorganization of lateral membrane interdigitation,
and decreased uptake of aminoglycoside antibiotics as
evidenced by decreased numbers of myeloid bodies in
these cells. The authors conclude that the use of the hu-
man proximal tubule culture system may be helpful in
discerning structural and functional effects of exposure
to cadmium and other nephrotoxicants on the kidney.

Synaptic rearrangement during postembryonic de-

Synaptic rearrangement during development is a char—
acteristic of the vertebrate nervous system and was
thought to distinguish vertebrates from the inverte-
brates. However, examination of the wind—sensitive
cercal sensory system of the cricket demonstrates that
some identified synaptic connections systematically
decrease in strength as an animal matures, while oth—
ers increase in strength over the same period. More—
over, a single sensory neuron could increase the strength
of its synaptic connection with one interneuron while
decreasing the strength of its connection with another
interneuron. Thus, rather than being a hallmark of the
vertebrate nervous system, synaptic rearrangement is
probably characteristic of the development of many if
not all nervous systems.

In vitro neural systems can be predictive for CNS neu—
rotoxicity. Using rat whole—brain reaggregate cultures,
good in vitro/in vivo correlations for the cholinergic
neurotoxicant ethylcholine mustard aziridinium have
been demonstrated. Treatment of reaggregates lesioned
with the cholinotoxin with a neurotropic factor, nerve
growth factor (NGF), did not reverse the lesion but
treatment of control cells with NGF elevated both cho-
line acetyltransferase activity and muscarinic receptor
binding. The “lesioned” reaggregate culture system may
thus be of future value in evaluating potential therapeu-
tic agents that could reverse such lesions in the CNS.

The effects of acute in vitro lead exposure on slowly
inactivating voltage—sensitive calcium channels in central
neurons of the freshwater pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis
were studied under voltage clamp. Three physiologi—
cally distinct cell types were used: two subsets of the
B cell cluster (Bpos and Bneg) and the pedal giant
neuron (RPeDl). These data indicate that (l) voltage-
sensitive calcium channels in Lymnaea neurons are
inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of free Pb2+;
(2) there are multiple types of calcium channels in
Lymnaea neurons; and (3) the effects of in vitro lead
exposure differ qualitatively among channel types.

Evaluation of neurotoxicity is heavily dependent upon

cytotoxicity assay using neuronal cell culture. Appli-
cations discussed for this in vitro technique include:
concentration-response relationships, mechanisms of
action, toxicity of parent compound or metabolites,
structure-activity relationships, and pharmacologic in-
tervention. This work demonstrates some of the ad—
vantages and disadvantages of in vitro alternatives to
whole animal testing.

sion of propidium iodide by intact cellular membranes.
This ﬂuorescent dye binds to nucleic acids at concen-
trations suitable for long-term exposure to neurons
without toxicity. The progressive loss of resting membrane
potential and the progressive inability to generate stimu-
lated action potentials by cultured mouse dorsal root
ganglion neurons is correlated with increasing incor-
poration of propidium iodide. The scoring system used
to gauge incorporation of propidium iodide is rapid
and highly reproducible using a standard fluorescence
microscope. Applications exist for studies of neuronal
toxicity, survival, and electrophysiology in vitro.

Vinca alkaloids, vincristine, vindesine, and vinblastine.
On the basis of a comparison of the data presented in

neurotoxicities, it is proposed that neurons of the snail
L. stagnalis may be suitable for the development of a
test system to predict the degree of clinical neurotox-
icity induced by Vinca antitumor drugs.

1988. Effects of antimicrobial agents used for therapy

Pediatr. Res. 24(3):367-72.

Experiments were undertaken to determine if in vitro
exposure of cultured brain cells to antibacterial drugs
could predict neurotoxicity in man. Effects of antibi-
otics used for therapy of bacterial CNS infections on
growth and differentiation in dissociated rat brain cell
cultures were studied. Results demonstrated a revers—
ible inhibition of cerebral sulfate transferase activity
and to a lesser extent of DNA synthesis in brain cell
cultures by the highest concentrations studied of amikacin,
cefuroxime, and ceftazidime which correspond to peak
cerebrospinal ﬂuid values attained by intraventricular
therapy in patients. Accumulation of DNA reﬂects
brain cell growth whereas cerebral sulfate transferase
activity parallels brain cell differentiation. Thus, this
brain cell culture model might become a supplement,
complement, or even alternative technique for neuro—
toxicity assessment of antibiotics with proven or po—
tential value for therapy of CNS infections.

Pheochromocytoma (PC—12) cells synthesize, store,

cate that PC—12 cells may be useful for neurochemical
evaluation of neurotoxicants with particular reference
to effects on catecholaminergic systems.

Myxicola infundibulum is a marine worm which is
gaining popularity in neuroscience research because
of its large syncytial axon. A model system using
Myxicola has been developed to investigate neurofilament
crosslinking in worms exposed to neurotoxic agents
whose putative mechanisms involve covalent crosslinking
of neurofilament proteins. These studies support pre-
vious observations which suggest that neurofilament
crosslinking is the molecular event which initiates
neurofilament aggregation in gamma—diketone neuro-
toxicity, and establish Myxicola iizfzmdibulum as a
useful species in which to study certain neurotoxic
compounds.

Tests have been carried out on a variety of potential
contaminating avian pathogens to determine whether
tests in chicks offer any advantage over tests in em-
bryos or cell cultures. In many cases, but not all, in
vitro tests were shown to be more sensitive. The use
of ﬂuorescent antibody or enzyme-linked assays serves
to enhance the sensitivity of the tests. In the future it
may be possible to adapt techniques such as nucleic
acid hybridization to the detection of extraneous
agents.

The pathogenicity of Legionella pneumophila, serogroup

LD50 data and the ability of the organism to induce
pathological lesions in the fertile hen’s egg. Results
reported here indicate that the fertile hen’s egg may be
a useful alternative to other animal systems for the in

in the treatment of Legionnaires’ disease.

An assay using established cell lines, human A431 epi-
dermal cells and mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, has been devel-
oped to predict the phototoxic potential of compounds.
The test determines the viability in response to UV
light in both the presence and absence of the test com—
pound. The system has been validated with 30 com—
pounds classified according to reactions in humans.

as an in vitro alternative to in vivo phototoxicity
testing. The Toxicologist lO(1):326(Abstr. 1304).

In this study the responsiveness of the in vitro yeast
phototoxicity test to a variety of fragranced and
unfragranced cosmetic formulations was compared with
the in vivo guinea pig phototoxicity models. The
results of these experiments show that the in vitro
yeast assay is more sensitive to phototoxicants than
either the guinea pig or human phototoxicity models.
Therefore, the yeast assay can serve as a rapid and
inexpensive screening in vitro assay for phototoxicity
evaluation, so long as the sensitivity of this model is
considered.

A quantitative in vitro method for phototoxic evalua-
tion of chemicals has been developed and validated.
The assay uses Saccharomyces cerevisiae, seeded in
an agar overlay on top of a plate count agar base.
Activity is quantified by cytotoxicity measured as zones
of inhibition. An excellent correlation is observed
between in vivo studies employing Hartley albino guinea
pigs and the in vitro assay for several fragrance raw
materials and other chemicals. Although the in vitro
assay does not discriminate between phototoxins and
photoallergens, it can be used for screening of raw ma-
terials so that reduction in animal usage can be achieved
while maintaining the protection of the consumer.

Physiology

Erickson-Lamy, K. A. The perfused trabecular mesh-

work as a model for outﬂow (human). Crisp Data
Base, National Institutes Of Health.

The experimental system to be used in these studies is
the perfused human outﬂow tissue model. This newly
developed model involves placement of the eviscer-
ated (e.g. lens and uveal tissue are removed) anterior
corneoscleral shell with attached trabecular meshwork
(TM) onto a specialized perfusion apparatus. The TM
and associated outflow tissues are perfused with cul—
ture medium at a physiologically—relevant perfusion
pressure in a 5% CO2 environment at 370C. Under
these conditions, the perfused TM is similar to the
human outﬂow system in vivo for several days with
regard to morphology as well as functional param—
eters. Of considerable interest is the finding that epi—
nephrine increases outﬂow facility in the perfused TM
model. The ability to study the epinephrine respon-
sive human outﬂow tissues for a period of several
days along with the opportunity to establish a model
which serves as an alternative to animal testing clearly
points to the potential importance of this model in
investigating the biology of the outﬂow pathway
system.

showed resistant results in the in vitro assay, thus
providing a preliminary indication that this assay may
be of value as a predictive test.

diploid fibroblast cell strains from various genetic
disorders to acute and protracted radiation expo-
sure. Radiat. Res. 123(1):87—92.

The cytotoxic effect of acute X irradiation was studied
by a colony formation assay in human skin fibroblast
cell strains from apparently normal individuals and
patients with a variety of genetic disorders possibly
associated with in vitro hypersensitivity to ionizing
radiation. The effect of protracted exposure to beta
radiation from tritiated water (HTO) was examined in
parallel experiments in 65 of these strains. The disor-
ders included neurological diseases and syndromes
characterized by an increased susceptibility to sponta-
neous and radiation—induced cancer. While HTO may
be useful as a quantitative method for determining the
cytotoxic response of human diploid cells to ionizing
radiation, the present results indicate that it does not
offer a more sensitive assay than acute X irradiation
for detecting minor degrees of hypersensitivity.

The possibility that human granulosa cells from the

was investigated. This system has the advantages that
human cumulus granulosa cells are readily available
from IVF/ET programs, the techniques for maintain—
ing the cells in culture are extremely simple, a marker
of highly differentiated granulosa cell function (pro-
gesterone production) can be reliably measured, and
the cells respond predictably like other comparable
granulosa cell systems. It is concluded that human
cumulus cells are a readily available and useful re—
source for in vitro screening of potential female repro-
ductive toxicants.

An elucidation of drug reproduction toxicology is pre-

and methodology of animal testing of drug substances
for their embryotoxic and teratogenic potential, perinatal

Epidermis was reconstructed in vitro by seeding hu-
man keratinocytes on a human dermal substrate in an
air—exposed culture. The end product was examined
by freeze-fracture electron microscopy, transmission
electron microscopy of thin sections, light micros—
copy, and lipid analysis using thin-layer chromatogra—
phy. In its present form, the air—exposed cell culture
already looks very promising as a model for studies of
skin differentiation disorders such as psoriasis or
ichthyosis, studies of the percutaneous penetration and
intra(epi)dermal biotransformation of drugs, and skin
toxicity screenings. It is suggested that certain imper-
fections in the air—exposed cell culture might be avoidable
by changing culture conditions such as the relative
humidity, the pH, or the composition of the medium.

Five substances were investigated for their primary

humans and skin erythema in rabbits. The uridine
uptake inhibition assay on KB cells was included as a
cytotoxicity test. The CBFV in the human correlated
very well with erythema scores obtained on rabbits. A
poor correlation was observed between the in vitro and
the in vivo results. From this study, it can be concluded
that CBFV measurement is a valid method for the
detection of erythema at subclinical concentrations.

The rat tail was tested as a practical alternative to the

obtained for the compound lindane were compared to
those with rat back and with those of rhesus monkeys.
Neither the total percentage urinary recovered nor the
half-life values obtained for the rat tail and rat back
models differed significantly. This method is consid—
ered to be less stressful on the animals than previous
procedures, which involved shaving, with its inherent
risk of skin abrasion, and the use of cumbersome foam-
rubber patches attached with tape, which were diffi—
cult to remove painlessly.

Thus, the number of paranuclear vacuoles reﬂected
decreases in protein synthesis by the injured epider-

A physiological skin model for in vitro toxicity studies.
Altern. Methods Toxicol. 7(In Vitro Toxicol: New
Dir.):183-9.

A three-dimensional skin model is being utilized as a
substrate for a variety of toxicity assays. This histo—
logically complete model is established by seeding
dermal fibroblasts onto a nylon mesh which has been
pretreated to optimize cell adherence. When suspended
in liquid medium, the fibroblasts form a dermal equivalent
by stretching across the 210 mum openings and de—
positing collagens and other matrix proteins. In 5—7
days a full-thickness dermis with mitotically and meta—
bolically active fibroblasts is established. Cocultured
melanocytes and keratinocytes continue to produce
melanin when inoculated onto this dermis and remain
above a naturally formed dermal/epidermal junction.
Keratinocytes exhibit normal differentiation patterns
and secrete keratin proteins. Human cells grown with
this skin model have been used successfully as sub-
strates for cytotoxicity and skin penetration studies.
This culture system is easily adaptable to standard
cytotoxicity assays and can be used as a tool to study
the effect of a variety of compounds on normal neona—
tal and adult skin in vitro.

The present study was undertaken to assess the poten-
tial and kinetics of N-Phenyl—p-phenylenediamine (N—
PPDA) uptake onto collagen. A linear relationship
between N—PPDA concentration and its uptake on col-
lagen fibrils was observed. A striking resemblance
between the binding kinetics of N-PPDA onto colla-
gen and that observed previously with skin portions in
vitro, suggests that the collagen fibril model may have
a use as a simple preliminary tool to screen chemicals
that show binding potential towards skin, in order to
make predictions about their dermal toxicity.

This is a brief overview on a series of studies per-
formed at the Italian National Institute of Health, all
focusing on the ability of mutagenicity short-term as-
says for identifying genotoxic agents and predicting
carcinogenicity. The analytical tools of such studies
were the multivariate data analysis statistical tech—
niques. The overall picture points to three main classes
of assays, on the basis of their responses to the chemi-
cal agents in the available data bases. The implica-
tions for practical chemical testing and battery design
are discussed.

Xenobiotica 19(12):1471-81.

The ability of 20 mono— and di—phenylhydantoin de—
rivatives to inhibit differentiation of rat embryo mid—
brain and limb bud cells in culture has been used as an
index of the teratogenic hazard represented by these
compounds. Molecular orbital calculations on these
compounds were combined with indices of teratoge—
nicity in the two cell types, to generate a coherent
structure-toxicity relationship. Teratogenicity corre-
lated with frontier orbital electron density of the N1
hydantoin ring atom in a sub-series of 12
monophenylhydantoins, whereas the corresponding
toxicity for both mono- and di-phenylhydantoins re-
lated more to the molecular polarizability of the mol-
ecule. Furthermore the importance of lipophilicity in
the toxicity of these compounds was indicated. Over-
all, the data emphasize the ability of electronic struc-
tural calculations to identify chemical descriptors of
toxicity.

Structure-activity relationship equations with model
toxicological endpoints have been developed to make
available alternative methods which approximate the
results that could be obtained from bioassays but which
are less expensive and time-consuming and use fewer,
if any, animals. These equations are based on sets of
bioassay results and explain the end—point under con-
sideration in terms of substructural and other param—
eters which describe the chemical entities. The result—
ing equations—or models—can then be used to
estimate—or predict—the end-point for new structures.
The estimation is followed by validation procedures.

of peroxisomal beta-oxidation in the rat liver in

Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 100(1):l77-84.

The effect of structure on the ability of tetrazole sub—
stituted acetophenones to induce peroxisomal beta oxi-
dation in the rat liver, in in vivo and in vitro situation,
was examined. For the in vivo studies, male rats were
fed a 25% dietary concentration of one of 12 tetrazole
substituted acetophenones for 10 days. Peroxisomal
beta oxidation and serum triglycerides were measured.
For in vitro studies, rat hepatocytes were cultured, test
compound added, and resulting supernatant assayed
for peroxisomal beta oxidation and proteins. There
was good agreement between in vivo and in vitro
studies. The activity of the compound was influenced
by the presence of free acid, the length of the alkyl
chain and the spatial orientation of the acidic tetrazole
with respect to the planar backbone of the molecule.

Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies
and in vitro studies in which correlations with LD50
have been sought are reviewed. It is concluded that
insufficient evidence is available to determine whether
QSAR methods can be of general use in predicting the
acute toxicity (LDso) of chemicals, although good cor-
relations have been obtained between toxicity in vivo
and in vitro, using systems in which the toxic endpoint
reﬂects the probable mechanism(s) of acute toxicity
of the test chemical (e.g. the assessment of neurotox-
ins using neural cell systems). The authors suggest
that the successful application of in vitro methods
requires a better understanding of the mechanisms of
acute toxicity in Vivo and the development of mam—
malian cell culture systems that can model more closely
the metabolic fate of the chemicals in vivo.

A number of N-alkylazacycloheptan-2-one derivatives,
with the hydrocarbon chain lengths systematically varied

toxicity effects. For this purpose, three in vitro cyto-
toxicity assays were used: (1) inhibition of prolifera-

tion of cultured human fibroblasts and keratinocytes;
(2) inhibition of collagen contraction by human fibro-
blasts; and (3) cell morphology changes in conﬂuent
cultures of human fibroblasts and keratinocytes. With
all assays used, the toxicity of N -alkylazacycloheptan—
2-one derivatives increased from C2 to C8, remained
constant at a hydrocarbon chain length between C8
and C14, and subsequently decreased with increasing
alkyl chain length. It may be that with these com-
pounds a parallelism exists between skin cell toxicity
and penetration enhancing capacity.

Results demonstrated that cultured hepatocytes retain
diverse bioactivation capabilities and that excision/

spectrum of types of chemical damage to DNA. The
authors conclude the hepatocyte/DNA repair test is
very reliable for the detection of a wide variety of
genotoxic carcinogens.

comitant studies of drug uptake into zygotes and drug
effects on both microtubule assembly in vitro and

The potential teratogenic hazard of three compounds

tems, a compound unaffected by mixed-functional oxidase
metabolism, and a compound thought to be inacti-
vated by cytochrome P-450 was evaluated using the

and a metabolic activation system. Embryos of the
South African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, were ex-
posed with and without the presence of the exogenous
metabolic activation system Aroclor 1254—induced rat
liver microsomes. The results demonstrate the utility
and importance of a metabolic activation system for in
vitro developmental toxicity screens such as FETAX.
Consistent use of a metabolic activation system with
FETAX should reduce the number of potential false—
positive and false-negative test results.

chemicals is presented. International laboratories al-
ready using or developing in vitro tests of various
partial aspects of general toxicity are invited to test
the substances. The predictivity of the in vitro results
for both partial and gross human toxicity data will be
determined with combined use of univariate regres-
sion analysis and soft multivariate modeling. The
predictivity of the in vitro results will be compared
with the predictivity of conventional animal tests for
the same chemicals. Finally, batteries of tests with
optimal prediction power for various types of human
toxicity will be selected. The need for and possible
uses of such batteries are discussed.

potential as a rapid, simple method to screen biomaterials

the purpose of classifying chemicals according to their
acute toxicity. Of the methods tested, the approxi-

very suitable alternative method to the classical LD50
test since it requires only about six animals, provides
enough information to order chemicals according to
their toxicities, and provides useful information for
planning subsequent repeated-dose studies.

From 436 Drosophila melanogaster cDNA clones, were
selected 39 that are expressed exclusively or pre—

clones has been identified, by sequence analysis, as
the structural gene (Arr) for a Drosophila homolog of
human arrestin. Vertebrate arrestin interacts with
rhodopsin in phototransduction and has been associ-
ated with an autoimmune form of uveitis in primates.
The presence of an arrestin homolog in Drosophila
suggests that both the vertebrate and invertebrate
phototransduction cascades are regulated in a similar
manner.

Issues For Institutional Animal Care

and Use Committees (IACUCs)

Prolonged Water Deprivation: A Case Study in
Decision Making by an IACUC

F. Barbara Orlans, Ph.D.

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this case study is to illustrate how a
conscientious Institutional Animal Care and Use Com—
mittee (IACUC) tackles a controversial procedure and
arrives at a decision. It concludes with a note describing
how case studies can be used for training purposes. In
order to maintain anonymity, only details relating to hu—
mane considerations are described.

A protocol involving prolonged and repeated water
deprivation of monkeys recently came before an IACUC.
The protocol involved adult rhesus monkeys, Macaea
mulatta, performing visual discrimination tasks as part
of a project investigating the development and allevia-
tion of strabismus in children. The monkeys were de—
prived of water for 22 out of every 24 hours for each of
the 5 test days in any 1 week. After the 22—hour water
deprivation period, each animal was placed in a restraint
chair and tested for a period of l to 1V4 hours. During the
test period, one drop of water was given as a reward each
time the monkey performed a required task. During the
remaining 45 to 60 minutes of the 24-hour period, the
animals were allowed as much water as they needed. On
the 6th and 7‘h day of the week, the animals were also al-
lowed free access to water. The cycle was then repeated.

The IACUC was uncomfortable about the water depri-
vation aspects of the study but did not question other
aspects of the protocol. Committee members thought
that the monkeys were being subjected to undue suffer-
ing. They questioned whether such a long period as 22
hours water deprivation was either necessary for the pro-
tocol or tolerable for the animal. The committee re-
quired the work to be stopped temporarily while addi-
tional information was sought. '

 

F. Barbara Orlans, Ph.D. is a research associate at the Kennedy Insti-
tute of Ethics, Georgetown University, in Washington, DC. This ar—
ticle is based on a chapter of a forthcoming book entitled In the Name
of Science: Issues in Responsible Animal Experimentation by F. Bar-
bara Orlans, to be published by Oxford University Press, New York.

48

The investigator argued that a 22—hour period of water
deprivation was standard practice among investigators,
and that any change in protocol would interfere with his
baseline data collected for more than 6 years. According
to the investigator, the animals seemed to be in satisfac—
tory condition; they maintained satisfactory body weight
and none had ever died from water deprivation. He said
that other investigators who currently use such periods of
deprivation had encountered no problems.

The committee’s responses were threefold: (l) The
fact that the procedure was standard practice did not nec-
essarily indicate that it was desirable orjustified; (2) The
claimed interference with baseline data was an untested
assumption since alternatives had not, at that point, been
tested; and (3) the animals’ failure to die was an unac—
ceptable criteria because life can be sustained under in-
tolerable conditions.

The committee conscientiously reviewed this protocol
at three meetings over a 2-month period. During this
time, it obtained expert opinions, conducted literature
searches, and sought out relevant policy statements. Even—
tually, notwithstanding the investigator’s objections, the
committee finally disapproved the water deprivation as-
pect of the study.

The IACUC concluded that prolonged water depriva-
tion was not justified for the following reasons:

(1) Although the animals appeared to be in satisfac—
tory physical condition, they were subject to unjustifiable
mental suffering;

(2) The animals’ thirst had no relevance to the subject
of scientific investigation. This was not research on
thirst—thirst was being used merely as an inducement to
perform a task. (There was a consensus among committee
members that justification for using water deprivation
would be enhanced if this were thirst research); and

(3) Alternative methods exist to induce animals to
perform tasks.

The committee learned that given free access to water
and food, animals will work well for rewards of high
preference foods or drinks that are not part of their nor-
mal laboratory fare. Rhesus monkeys will work well for

rewards such as mandarin oranges, yogurt, Gatorade (a
commercially available fruit drink), or malted milk. (For
the animals’ general health, these nutritionally balanced
rewards are better than others such as sucrose pellets or
marshmallows). The investigator was advised to rede-
sign his protocol along these lines.

An analysis of the information that helped the com-
mittee arrive at this decision is described below. The
sources are expert opinions, a literature search, and
statements of national policy.

EXPERT OPINION

The committee solicited expert opinions from a number
of primatologists, psychologists, physiologists, other sci-
entists, and relevant professional scientific associations.
It described the protocol and sought advice. A wide
range of opinions emerged. Many who objected to this
protocol indicated that there is no rationale for this type
of water deprivation. Several scientists wondered whether
human beings could tolerate 22 hours a day without wa—
ter for 5 days a week. Primatologists as a group tended
to show particular sensitivity to animal welfare issues
involved. They, and others, concluded that the monkeys
would suffer severe distress from the long period of thirst
followed by drop—by-drop water administration and said
they would disapprove this procedure. Several experts
questioned whether the daily dehydration would affect
the monkeys’ vision and, therefore, the researcher’s re-
sults. Many offered constructive advice regarding alter-
native procedures involving rewards that could be sub-
stituted for extreme thirst (see above).

On the other hand, a number of opinions were voiced
in support of the procedure. For instance, a spokesper—
son from a professional association, after having sampled
opinions from association members, reported, “There was
no sense (among these scientists) that there was anything
wrong with this regimen, not at all.” One expert who had
used a similar procedure said, “Animals adapt to drink—
ing only once per day, and there is no cause for concern
over this protocol.”

Among those experts who were tolerant of the 22—hour
deprivation, several suggested evaluating the animals at
the start of the experiment and then continually moni—
toring them to be certain they remain in good health.
Several experts stressed the importance of monitoring
animals individually —— averaging the figures for water
intake or urine output of a group of animals would not be
satisfactory, because individuals vary greatly. Indeed,
care must be used to establish baseline data for an indi-
vidual animal. For instance, if the relative humidity of
the environment is low, or if a particular animal is prone
to sneezing (thereby losing water droplets), the animal’s
water intake would tend to rise. Another factor is the
housing arrangement. If the animals are group—housed,
the social rank of the animal will inﬂuence how much

Volume 33, Number 3 Summer 1991

water a particular animal may obtain, because the ani—
mals themselves prioritize access to both water and food.

Each individual animal should be checked for contin-
ued good health judged by stability in weight; stablility
of performance in the experimental protocol; develop—
ment of signs of dehydration, (e.g. daily total water in-
take, urine output and specific gravity, and sequential
multiple analysis of blood); and the development of signs
of stress. Disturbances of normal activities can signal
stress, including changes in normal sleep/wake cycles;
abnormal levels of social adjustment when placed in a
cage with other animals of the same species; and emer-
gence of abnormal behaviors such as foot/thumb suck-
ing, cage chewing, abnormal vocalization, and aggres—
sion. These experts recommended that the monkeys
should be removed from the study if their health begins
to deteriorate.

After listening to the experts, the committee was faced
with a difficult choice: (1) Should the procedure be aban—
doned completely and another more humane method sub-
stituted? or (2) Can the water deprivation be made hu-
mane enough (with health monitoring) to allow it to
continue?

The health monitoring so far conducted by the investi—
gator had been superficial and not the rigorous monitor—
ing suggested by the experts. The committee gave some
thought to requiring that the investigator conduct a pilot
study of two animals with rigorous monitoring. With
this additional information, the committee perhaps would
have been convinced that it would be all right for the
investigator to continue with additional animals. But
this pilot study idea was put aside and, in the end, never

acted on because other inﬂuential information emerged.

In discussions with the experts, the committee debated
whether the investigator should be asked to substitute
food deprivation for water deprivation because animals
can withstand food deprivation with less stress. How-
ever, the committee considered food deprivation a type
of punishment and abandoned this idea because of the
general principle that rewards should be used in prefer—
ence to punishments whenever possible.

The experts’ information about using high preference
foods and drinks as rewards played an important role in
the committee’s final decision. This significant fact
emerged only from communication with experts. Nei-
ther the scientific literature nor policy statements pro—
vided such information, emphasizing the importance of
exploring many avenues of advice.

LITERATURE SEARCH

The committee pursued another avenue of information-
gathering by seeking help from the scientific literature,
which showed that a complicated set of factors are in-
volved in thirst (see for instance the classic paper of
Adolph et al., 1954) and that there is considerable bio-

49

 

 

 

 

 




 

logical variation among individuals within a species. How—
ever information on variables that might inﬂuence the
effects of water deprivation such as species, age, or other
factors was not really helpful. In general, the literature
provided a sparse source of help. For instance, the com—
mittee asked the investigator to provide publications to
substantiate his claim that this pattern of water depriva-
tion is not deleterious to the animals. Although similar
procedures are used by others, the investigator could
provide no published research articles in which the hu-
maneness or justification of this procedure is discussed.

Nothing was found in the literature concerning the
effects on animals of prolonged and repeated daily peri-
ods of water deprivation. However, in research on thirst,
some researchers reported the effect on rhesus monkeys
of a single 24 hour period of water deprivation, “The
monkeys experienced significant cellular dehydration, as
indicated by a 5.8% elevation in plasma osmolarity that
exceeded the threshold for thirst, and a significant hy-
povolemia, as indicated by elevated plasma protein and
hematocrit values,” (Wood et al., 1982). These investiga-
tors reported that following a single period of 24-hour
water deprivation, a “mean volume of 32.1 i 12.2 ml.kg'l
was drunk over 15 minutes . . . . The mean weight loss dur—
ing the deprivation period was 35 i 7.8 g.kg'1. The plasma
osmolarity increased from 295 i 2 to 312 i 3 mosmol.kg'1
. . .The magnitude of the cellular dehydration produced by
water deprivation is indicated by the increases observed in
plasma osmolarity . . . and sodium concentration.”

Thus, there appears to be merit in the concerns, voiced
by some experts, that cellular dehydration should be rec-
ognized as a potentially confounding factor in interpret-
ing the researcher’s results.

Committees like to know what other committees have
done when faced with a similar situation, and the litera-
ture was searched for such information. IACUCs are
understandably troubled when they learn that they are
making decisions that differ from those made by other
committees when reviewing the same procedures. Anec—
dotal information about inconsistencies of IACUC
decisions abound, but to date, scholarship (and therefore
accounts in the literature) on analysis of IACUC deci-
sions is in its infancy. In what is probably the first such
endeavor, Professor Rebecca Dresser, J .D., reports on a
survey in which IACUCs reviewed identical protocols,
one of which is similar to the one under discussion in this
paper —— prolonged water deprivation that is not part of
research on thirst (Dresser, 1989). In the case described
by Dresser, six squirrel monkeys were to be deprived of
water 5 days a week except for one randomly timed 30-
minute period daily.

Dresser reports that the 31 committees reviewing the
case “typically wanted evidence that the monkeys would
be adequately hydrated and often asked whether the in-
vestigator could substitute positive reinforcement or food
deprivation, which is viewed as less detrimental to the
animals.” One committee immediately disapproved the

50

water deprivation section of the protocol and others wanted
additional information. For instance, one committee re-
quired that the investigator justify the need for water
deprivation; another wanted documentation that water
deprivation is safe and required the investigator to de-
scribe the monitoring plan to ensure against dehydration;
and another wanted information on how nutritional needs
of the animal would be satisfied during water deprivation
because they would be unable to eat when their mouths
were dry from severe thirst. (This point is of signifi-
cance for all species of animals and in particular to the
case presented in this article because rhesus and other
macaques tend to drink while eating. Even within spe-
cies, wide variations can be found from animal to animal
with respect to differences in habits of eating with or
without water consumption). As one would expect, these
31 committees did not show uniform judgments, although
there is certainly a sense that prolonged water depriva-
tion raised significant concerns among them.

POLICIES

The committee was grappling with the problem of deter-
mining where the burden of proof lies and sought guid—
ance from national policies. Should the burden be to
show that the procedure is acceptable, or the reverse, that
the procedure is inhumane? This is an exceedingly im-
portant and difficult issue to address because the choice
inescapably biases the case against the side that must
accept the burden of proof. Should one assume that
the animal is not necessarily suffering (and, therefore,
initiate monitoring procedures), or should one assume
that the animal probably is suffering (and, therefore, sub-
stitute alternative procedures)? Current public policy
offers little guidance on how to approach these issues.

The Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals does state, however,
that in the absence of established evidence to the con—
trary, “Investigators should consider that procedures that
cause pain or distress in human beings may cause pain or
distress in animals” (PHS, 1986). This statement played
a part in inﬂuencing the committee’s final decision.

The issue of water deprivation as part of a research
protocol is not specifically addressed in either the PHS
policy or the Animal Welfare Act. However, it is men-
tioned in several voluntary codes from professional orga—
nizations both in the United States and abroad. On the
whole, the guidelines that were found tended to place 22
hours of water deprivation into a very questionable cat—
egory, and some would prohibit it.

Since the investigator was a psychologist, it was ap-
propriate that guidance should be sought from the offi-
cial code of the American Psychological Association (APA)
(1985). Part of this code states, “Procedures involving
extensive food or water deprivation should be used only
when minimal deprivation procedures are inappropriate

to the design and purpose of the research.” Similarly, in
another context, the guidelines state, “Psychologists should
adjust the parameters of [aversive] stimulation to levels
that appear minimal.” The investigator was confronted
with this statement in the early part of the negotiations
with the IACUC. He said that if he used a shorter period
of water deprivation, such as 6 hours, then the monkeys
refused to perform the required tasks after a relatively
short time. The investigator said he needed an hour or
more to collect what he considered to be a satisfactory
volume of results each day. Thus, it seemed that the
investigator’s decision was based on convenience to himself
—namely, the faster accumulation of data—and not on
the benefit to the animals. Several policies in various
contexts state that when there is a conﬂict between in—
vestigator convenience and welfare of the animal, then
the animal shall take precedence (see for instance the
Canadian Council on Animal Care, 1980).

Other provisions of the APA guidelines, not specifi—
cally concerning water deprivation per se, are: (l) “Psy—
chologists are encouraged to test painful stimuli on themselves
wherever reasonable,” and (2) “Whenever consistent with
the goals of the research, consideration should be given
to providing the animal with control over the painful
stimulation.” One of the experts suggested that the in-
vestigator and the committee follow these provisions as
the best guidelines available.

Another set of pertinent guidelines comes from the
New York Academy of Sciences which state, in part:

Water deprivation should be used primarily when
thirst or drinking is the specific object of the
study or if required for the safety of the animal
prior to anesthetic procedures. When water dep-
rivation is contemplated for other procedures,
special consideration must be given since water
deprivation usually affects an animal’s physi-
ological and metabolic condition more than does
food deprivation. The period of withholding fluid
should not ordinarily exceed limits similar to
those established by the US. Department ong—
riculture for the transport of the species con-
cerned. If these are exceeded, the approval of
the full IACUC is required (New York Academy
of Sciences, 1988).

The specifics of the US. Department of Agriculture's
(USDA’s) policies are not included in the Academy’s
guidelines. However, referring back to the USDA Ani—
mal Welfare Regulations, it is found that nonhuman pri—
mates must be given water “at least every 12 hours” once
having been accepted for transport. Since the monkeys
were deprived of water for a period considerably longer
than 12 hours, the Academy’s waiver would take effect
and approval of the full IACUC would be required.

There are also relevant policies in both Canada and
the United Kingdom. Unlike the guidelines of the New
York Academy of Sciences, the national standards of

Volume 33, Number 3 Summer 1991

Canada allow no waivers. The Guide to the Care and
Use of Experimental Animals of the Canadian Council
on Animal Care unreservedly states, “Water deprivation
should be used only when thirst is the specific subject of
the study (Canadian Council on Animal Care, 1980).”
Perhaps the most uncompromising policy of all those
encountered is that of The Biological Council (1987) in
the United Kingdom. This Council is made up of repre—
sentatives of ten professional associations, including the
British Veterinary Association, the British Laboratory
Animals Veterinary Association, the Physiological Soci-
ety, and others. This policy states, in part, “Water should
always be available to all animals.” Under these guide—
lines, the protocol could not be approved.

On the whole, therefore, the voluntary codes reﬂect
the same concerns that were expressed by the IACUC.

CONCLUSION

The committee found that, in its totality, the information
from experts, the literature, and policy statements tended
to substantiate its original concerns. Though committee
members anguished over the resistance encountered from
the investigator, they finally came to a firm conclusion
that this procedure could not be approved.

The decision-making process followed by a conscien-
tious committee is complex and painstaking. It is impor-
tant that multiple sources of information be sought because
some types of information are available only from certain
sources. Throughout the process, inevitably, there was
ambiguity on some questions, and many difficult choices
had to be made. It is a tribute to conscientious committees
that they fulfill their mandated role with such rigor.

NOTE

Case studies such as this one are useful tools for training
purposes. They can be used in seminars for students or
in training courses for laboratory personnel. To use a
case study for these purposes, the participants role-play
as IACUC members, and a leader acts as the chairperson.
The protocol is described (but not the conclusion) and
discussion is opened. The participants are invited to
identify and analyze the humane issues and come to a
conclusion to approve, disapprove, or modify the proto-
col. Case studies can help to sensitize people to animal
welfare concerns and the dilemmas faced by conscien-
tious committee members.

Animals Available

Hydrocephalic Rat Line

A mutant hydrocephalic rat line, maintained by S. P.
Hicks, a researcher at the University of Michigan Medi-
cal School, is being disbanded. These rats show local
overgrowth of the dorsal midbrain—thalamic junction (MTJ)
beginning on the fourteenth fetal day, bringing about
closing of the aqueduct by the nineteenth day, with rapid
development of hydrocephalus prenatally. Expression is
variable, and the constant reliable gene marker is sparse
hair. The recessive mutation arose spontaneously in the
fiftieth generation of brother >< sister mating of albino

WF rats given to Dr. Hicks by Dr. Jacob Furth at F34.
The strain is now at F107 and is designated WF/Hda-
hyc. The mutation is autosomal, and the mutants re-
semble in some respects hydrocephalic rats caused by
prenatal B 12 deficiency or folate analogs, and hydrocephalic
rats produced by prenatal irradiation on the eleventh day,
and human sex—linked prenatally originating hydrocephalics.

Robert A. Whitney, Jr. Promoted

Dr. Robert A. Whitney, Jr., Director of the National
Center for Research Resources, National Institutes of
Health (NIH), was promoted recently to “08” rank as an
Assistant Surgeon General, U.S. Public Health Service.
The action is equivalent to promotion from brigadier
general to major general in the U.S. Army or to a “two
star” rear admiral in the Navy. Dr. Whitney is only the
second veterinary officer in any of the U.S. uniformed
services to receive this honor. Former Assistant Surgeon
General Joe R. Held retired from the Commissioned
Corps in 1984 with the 08 rank.

The National Center for Research Resources, headed
by Dr. Whitney, is the NIH component responsible for
developing and making available resources needed for
biomedical research at NIH and at other institutions where
research is supported by Public Health Service grants.

Internationally Known Primate Research
Scientist Joins Yerkes Center

Dr. Frans de Waal, whose behavioral research with apes
and monkeys has garnered both public and scientific
recognition, has joined the Department of Psychology
and the Yerkes Primate Research Center of Emory Uni-
versity. Known to the public for his two books, Chim-
panzee Politics, and Peacemaking Among Primates, Dr.
de Waal has attracted international scientific attention
for his research on how conﬂicts in primate societies are
avoided and how relationships of the combatants are
repaired and normalized when conﬂicts occur. At Emory,
Dr. de Waal has a joint appointment as Associate Profes-
sor of Psychology and Yerkes Research Professor of Be-
havioral Biology. This position allows him to combine
teaching in the Department of Psychology with research
on the social intelligence of apes and monkeys at the
Yerkes Center. Dr. de Waal received his Ph.D. in biol-
ogy in 1977 from the University of Utrecht in the Nether-
lands, and has written more than 25 scientific papers in

National Research Council. A six member committee
has revised the. 1971 publication A Guide to Infectious
Diseases of Mice and Rats. The committee’s report con—
sists of two documents. The first, aimed at laboratory
animal scientists, is a complete discussion of infectious
diseases of these animals. The second, the Companion
Guide to Infectious Diseases of Mice and Rats (listed
below) aimed at biomedical scientists, is a handbook
providing a brief review of information relevant to inves-
tigators’ needs. Both volumes have a broader scope than
the predecessor, which focused solely on the etiology,

clinical signs, pathology, and diagnosis of specific dis-
eases. The revisions discuss principles of rodent disease
prevention and include, in addition to the topics con-
tained in the 1971 report, summaries of the pathogenesis
and control of these diseases. An important new area
covered is the significance of these diseases, that is, the
way in which they can interfere with research. National

readily accessible to researchers. This volume parallels
the three parts of the main volume. The first part brieﬂy
examines the requirements for maintaining pathogen-free
rodents, factors in designing health surveillance programs,
and other laboratory management issues. The second
part is an easy-to-use reference section, listing diagnosis
and control methods, the potential for interference with
research, and other factors for disease agents ranging
from adenoviruses to tapeworms. The third part presents
alphabetical listings of clinical signs, pathology, and re-
search complications and lists infectious agents that might
be responsible for each. National Academy Press, 1991,

BUSH SIGNS THE WILD BIRD CONSERVATIOB ACT

Afte‘lf: over two and a half years of lobbying, negotiations
and congressional procedure, President Bush signed The Wild Bird
Conservation Act on Friday 23rd October. The original sponsors of
the bi ll, Representative Gerry Studds and Senators Baucus and
maffee are to be congratulated on achieving passage of this
important bill that establishes the concept of reverse listing;
Under the current system trade is allowed until it can be‘
conclusively slim that a species is endangered by trade. With
reverse listing the Species is protected unless those wishing to "
trade can soientifieeily demoﬁstrate that their activities will not
harm the conservation of the species is. giving the Species the
benefit of the doubt rather than the trader . Governor Mike Haydyn
of the 8.5.13‘31521 and Wildlife Service was also a keen and active
proponent of the legislation.. Defenders of Wildlife, BIA-03,1313
and SAP}. were the core of the large number of N603 supporting the
legislation. . _

Although considerable comptonises were made. to obtain a consensus

with the pet trade and “WE—Us, if properly implemented the

legislation Should address the problems of the wild bird trade.

The lmiSlation enacts an immediate ban on trade in seven species.
of parrot 11an to be severely oval-exploited. It also gives the

F1521 and Wildlife service the ability to suspmud trade when it
poses a risk to the conservation of a species.

 

The wild Bird Conservation not requires a moratorium on imports of
Species listed Under the Convention on International Trade in,
Endangered Species Of Wild Flora and Fauna. (CITES)... this includes
. all parrots except budgmmqars and sacks-.1915 and many other
"species of birds. Trade in a speoies can be restarted from a
~particu1ar country if it: can be shown that various management,
conservation and welfare criteria have been met. specifically
countries met fully meet the requirements of CITES, which no bird
exporting country does at present. There must be a scientifically-
based management plan for the species. This plan mt provide for
the conservation of the afieciea and its habitat,- give incentives
for conservation and address factors such as illegal trade,
domestic trade and habitat loss The plan must also be implemented
and enforced. The hethods of Wren, transport and maintenance of
the species most minimize the risk of. injury or damage to health,
including inhumane treatment. .. .

 

AlthOugh no country yet meets the standards set by the legislation

(in most cases matey-.13 no management plan, no Scientific surveys,

little enforcement and little or nothing is done to protect the

welfare of the birds), the pet industry is confident that they can

keep trade open in a number of species. "RICH has announced that it

The staff of the MSPCA and I were disappointed that you could not
be with us to receive the George T. Angell Humanitarian Award. vWe
were also concerned that you have been ill and certainly wish you
a very speedy recovery.

 
 

It was a meaningful, fun and uplifting evening and I'm sure you
would have enjoyed it“ I can think of no one who is more deserving
of the highest award that we give than you who have selflessly
devoted your life to the welfare of animals.

  
 

    
  

I have enclosed a copy of the evening program for your information.
Mr. Gleiber did an exceptional job in accepting the award in your
behalf.

Death of Rare Malaysian Tiger on Flight to U. 8. Is Revealed

I Animals: The cub was
reportedly conﬁned in cargo
hold in a small crate with poor
ventilation.

 

By TOM GORMAN
trues sum: warren

SAN DIEGO—A rare Malaysian tiger,
one of only about 200 in enstence. died
while being ﬂown from Koala Lumpur to
Los Angeles after being placed by Malay-
Stan authorities in a crate that was partly
wrapped in plastic and barely larger than
the animal itself. authorities said Tuesday.

The lw-ponnd female tiger was one of
two lO—month-old sister cubs that were
destined on Feb. 19 for the San Diego Zoo,
which plans to establish a breedingpro
gram for the endangered animal. distinc-
tive for its bright orange color'mg and
black stripes.

The animal was ailing—if not already
dead—when a Malaysian Airlines 747
stopped for two hours in Honolulu and
ground argo handlers said they smelled

smoothing foul. But before a veterinarian
for the U. S. Department of Agriculture
could arrive at the airport to check on the
animal's condition. the airliner already had
taken off for L08 Angela.

When the plane landed at Los Angeles
on Feb. 19, concluding the 24-hour trip. the
cub was dead. either from dehydration or
because it apparently had overheated in its
small wooden cage, said Dr. Ron DeHaven,
animal care supervisor for the USDA in
Sacramento.

“ he cagewasharely largerthanthe
' l itself," DeHaven said. “It
literally could not stand up in the crate.
There was no ventilation. It was a solid
wooden crate except for one end. the tail
end. where there was heavy gauge wire.

“But the crate was wrapped in plastic
halfway up. so that half was cut off to
ventilation." he said.

The animal was 43 inches long from the
crown of its head to the base of its tail, and
the cage was just 46 inches long. a USDA
inmection showed. The cage was 23%
inches in height and 223/: inches wide.

The investigation into the cub's death

will tours on wgo handlers in Honolulu
and whether the animal was properly
aged for shipment in Kuala Lumpur.
where the two cubs were born m captivity,
aocordingtosouroes.

The two tigers were on loan from the
Malaysian Wildlile Authority to the San
Diego Zoo. Ofﬁcials for the wildlife author —
ity were not reachable for comment.

”It's beyond disappointment" said Jeff
Jouett. spokesman for the San Diego
Zoological Society. which operates the San
Diego Zoo. where the two cubs were
headed. “We' re outraged about this. We' re
mad as hell.

“There can be no excuse for how those
tigers were shipped. and we're hoping
someone will be called to account for it."
Jouett said. “To say that we're shocked.
saddened and angered is putting it mildly.“

The surviving female cub—which was
said to be "stressed" by the flight—is in
routine quarantine at the San Diego 200
before going on display in its exhibit

At the 200’s request. the (LS. Fish and
Wildlife Service began an investigation
into the incident and is considering press—
ing criminal or civil charges said Larry

Farrington senior special agent for its los
Angeles office.

Farrmgton said that the reason one
animal died and the other lived may be
because “the cage with the live animal was
bigger than the dead annual. This is pretty
simple stuff.”

The cub‘s death is the second in recent
weeks involving the transportation of ex-
otic animals. Last Friday. Hannibal. the
Los Angeles Zoo's ﬁve-ton African bull
elephant; died after being sedated for
shipment to Mexico.

he International Air Transport Assn

sets guidelines for memberswinclud-
ing Malaysian Airlines—on shipping live
animals including speciﬁcations for ado-
quate ventilation with air holes.

A USDA inspector said that of the cage' 5
so: walls. only one—at the cub's rear
end—had ventilation through heavy gauge
mesh wire. There were no other breathing
holes and the bottom and inside walls were
lined "with metal sheet.” he noted in an
internal memo to his boss

A USDA veterinarian in Honolulu. Dr.
Elizabeth Lyons, said she learned from

authorities to Honolulu that the airplane
containing the two ugers had landed there.
and that one was in distress. according to a
USDA memo obtained by The Times.

But by the time she got to the airport.
the Jumbo jet had left. She called to alert
the San Diegrl Zoo.

“No care was provided for either tiger in
Hawaii " U DA veterinarian Wensley
Koch wrote in his report to DeHaven and
other superiors. “The tiger that died was
apparently grossly mishandled by both the
shipper and the airline.” Koch wrote. '“l‘he
Honolulu station manager {for Maiaysan
Air! inns] uanesuonahly consuiereo punc-
tuality to be :more important than animal
welfare."

Ralph Knox. administrative executive
for Malaysnan Airiine‘s North America
operations, said he had "heard about the
student" but anew few details.

“The shipper does the crating and all the
handling," Khox said‘ And the mat is
only accepted according to the guidelines
of live animal carriage. Our agent looks at
the documents and the cage. but he does
not, nor is expected to have. expertise on
the health and condition oi the animal."

"You're spending $400,000 to seTT a cow's WHAT?!"

——An Anonymous Taxpayer

v' Dear CoTTeague,

The USDA has announced how it' 5 going to hand— out $200 miTTion worth
of goodies under the Market Promotion Program (MPP). ATT I can say is,
it' s a strange way to spend our constituents' tax money.

 

As you may know, the MPP is a notorious corporate weIfare program in
which the AgricuIture Department pays AmeriCan corporations to advertise
their products abroadé—something which, when you think about it, the
corporations woqu probabTy do anyway.

The money is given to industry associations and individuaT businesses
which then use it to advertise their products genericaTTy ("Eat kiwi
fruit") or by brand name ("Try CampbeTT Soup").

There's a Tong Tist of Tucky recipients. Thétﬁhocoiate peopTe get
$2.1 miTTion to seII their candy. Kentucky DistiITers get $3.7 miTTion to
market bourbon. The Tobacco Associates get $3.5 miTTion to push
unmanufactured tobacco. Even'the Popcorn Institute gets $197,000 to seTT
popcorn. A ;

Then there's my persona] favorite. The NationaT Association of
AnimaT Breeders gets $394,000 to market what the USDA caTTs "Bovine semen,
frozen." That's right, $394,000 of tax money to seTI buIT semen.

I don‘t mean to make Tight of theSe products. Far from it. These
products are without doubt the finest of their kind in the worId——which is
exactTy why the government shoqu not have to pay these groups to $911
them. The Market Promotion Program isxa corporate hand—out, nothing
more. \

I've introduced a biIT to stop this nonsense, kiTTthe_MPP, and save ‘
the taxpayers $200 miIIion a year. If you woqu Tike to sign on as a .
cosponsor,p1ease have your stan caTT Brian Gunderson in my office at 5—

Complaints about the depart-
,jfmcnt‘s oversight of the Marketing

, the start.

agency operated with little plan-
ning and loose regulations. ac-
cording to government audits.

In a series ofaudits. the (icneral
Accounting Office said it couldn't
find adequate documentation to
show why the export agency gives
out several.mi|liou dollars a year
to some businesses but allots
othersjust a few thousand.

“Funding decisions appear to
be made upon applications that
are really quite minimally de-
tailed," GAO auditor Allan Men-
delowitz told the House Agricul-
ture Cornnrittee in July l988.

Last year. Mcndclowitz repeat-
ed the criticisms. Although the
Foreign Agricultural Service had
responded to some audit recom-
mendations. “we found that FAS
still does not have an adequate
system of internal controls." he
said.

The Foreign Agricultural Scr—
vice this year created a set of
regulations to govern the pro-
gram. Urrtil now, the agency has
merely asked participants to
follow guidelines.

But a review of
taincd by The .S'Iur under the
Freedom of lnforrnation Act
found that some recipients contin-

reeords ob-

ue to offer little accounting for
expenses such as travel and
consultants.

Umbrellasaud consultants

The California Walnut Com-
mission spent your money on
business cards. excessive travel
expenses and $3.000 in “petty
cash" and miscellaneous expenses
rung up by its advertising agency
in Australia.

Ollicials for the American
Soybean Association bought busi-
ness cards. too. and first-class
plane tickets. And they used the
tax money to pay the salaries of
secretaries overseas without ap-
proval.

Other

program participants

have charged taxpayers for late‘

charges on credit cards ‘and
“consulting" commissions for
people to reserve hotel rooms for
promotional banquets and to mail
out invitations.

in these cases and others. the
department asked for and
received —- the money back.

But it approved other expenses.
such as when the Wine lnstitute in
California paid public dollars to
ﬂy Japanese visitors on helicopter
tours ofvineyards.

One of the more unusual bills
was sent in last year by the Walnut
Commission. which wanted to see
if its advertising was hitting home
with Japanese consumers. So it
hired a consulting firm to do
door-to-door interviews.

The firm questioned 700 per-
sons. The cost to taxpayers:
548.774. That‘s about $70 an
interview —— and just part of the
$8 million a year the walnut group
gets from the Agriculture Depart-
ment to tout its nuts in Asia.

USDA analysts at first deemed
the polling expense “an unreason-
able expenditure" and asked for
an explanation or the money back.
But after the walnut board
provided a breakdown of the poll
expenses —-— including cash paid to
participants to answer the ques-
tions —- the department dropped
its claims.

According to audit records.
USDA officials apparently never
found out the results ofthe survey
or whether the board sold a single

walnut because ofit. ‘7‘“

‘ And it‘s also'just one small part

of a $200 million-a-year govern-
ment venture called the Market
Promotion Program. Better
known among industry recipients
by its old name. Targeted Export
Assistance, the program has spent
about $1 billion since 1986 for
foreign television commercials.
grocery displays, wine tastings
and other promotions in markets
around the world.

it‘s supposed to help shore up
America‘s sagging exports by
promoting the labor of American
farmers.

But often. according to an
examination by The Kansas City
Star. your money merely becomes
advertising pocket change for
some of the world's biggest food
companies. like Sunkist growers
($9 million). Tyson Foods ($4.6
million). E&.l Gallo Wines ($2.3
million) and Pillsbury Foods ($1.2
million).

How do those giants spend your
money? Many would not say.

Even some USDA employees
who oversee the program for the
Foreign Agricultural Service say
they have no idea exactly how the
money was spent. They say
they're kept in the dark about
advertising strategies and whether
they‘re paying off.

Some of the recipients ack-
nowledge -— privately -— that the
program is seriously flawed.

“Frankly, there are people
spending tax dollars who
shouldn‘t be," said a recipient
who would talk only if his name
was withheld. After all, he plans to
seek more money for his cause
next year.

“1 don‘t think you could find
two people in the South Ag
Building in Washington who. if
truthful, would tell you that they
think the TEA program is worth
the powder it would take to blow
the thing to hell.“

Critics say the program does
less to help farmers than it does to
line the pockets of Big Food.

“At a time when we are trying
to squeeze every last dollar out of
the federal budget, we shouldn‘t
be asking American taxpayers to
pick up the multimillion-dollar
tab for foreign advertising ex-
penses of huge multinational
corporations." says US. Rep.
Charles Schumer ofNew York.

Philip Mackie. assistant ad-
ministrator of commodity and
marketing programs for the
Foreign Agricultural Service, de-
fends the program as a valuable
tool for farmers and notes that

companies put up their own
money to supplement public
funds.

"The object is not to help any
particular company but to help
the producer.“ Mackie said.

He doesn‘t dispute that his
agency has lacked information
about brand-name promotions.

summer should help
oversight. he said.

“1 know we're getting the
informationwe feel is necessary to
operate the program." he said.
“Otherwise. we wouldn‘t do it."

The Star's examination found
that trade groups participating in
the promotion plan billed the
government for expenses that
often had little to do with touting
American exports.

For example. how did trade
associations help American farrn-
ers by buying business cards.
paying secretaries' salaries. paying
late charges on credit cards or
buying 600 non-waterproof um-
brellas?

in some of those cases. the
Foreign Agricultural Service de-
manded the money back and got
it. But sometimes the companies
said no, and they won.

The Market Promotion Pro-
gram arose in the l980s from a

Helping farmers?

The department could provide
a list of its Market Promotion
Program participants only for the
1990 budget year -— five years
after the program started.

Even a partial list reads like a
“Who‘s Who" in food. Besides the
companies already mentiOned,
taxpayers helped advertise Blue
Diamond almonds ($7.6 million).
Sunsweet prune growers ($3.3
million), Sun-Maid raisins ($2.7
million), Welch's ($648,000). Ral-
ston Purina ($380,000). Seagram's
($310,000). McDonald‘s
($210,000) and Campbell Soup
($180,000).

and bovine semen ($400,000).

It's an impressive list. But in
some cases it's difficult to see
where most American farmers —
or taxpayers -— benefited at all.

Dozens of companies already
had touted their products over-
seas for years, without any
apparent. need for taxpayer sub-
sidies. Some of the products seem

to rely little on farm commodities. .

And many of the largest recipients
gowthetr own crops in private
with or vineyards. or contract
only with certain farmers.

Dole, remember, got 54 million.
it grows its own pineapples and
bananas and has farms in Hawaii
and across the world, including
the Philippines, Honduras and
Thailand.

Klein said the company buys
some of its produce. such as
raisins and citrus. from indepen-

dent farmers. And while she could
not provide a breakdown of the
Market Promotion Program mon-
ey. she insisted it paid only for
products grown in America.

There's also Pillsbury Foods.
which isn't an American com-
pany. Although based in Minne-
apolis, Pillsbury is actually owned
by the British conglomerate
Grand Metropolitan PLC. ,

Pillsbury is famous for its
Popping Fresh dough boy, Jolly
Green Giant, Jeno's pizzas and
Burger Kin Whoppers. But it
received its 1.2 million to market
frozen corn in Japan and else-
where in the Pacific Rim.

The company already was
selling corn there. Though Japan
has many trade barriers, it doesn‘t
restrict imports ofcorn for human
consumption, according to the
Office of the US. Trade
Representative.

Moreover, selling more Pills-

spokesman, said - the company's

market programs.

. , Finding the money

The USDA's Foreign Agricul-
tural Service oversees both the
Market Promotion Program and a
much smaller related plan begun
in the 19505. The earlier plan
spends about $35 million a year
on promoting bulk commodities.
such as wheat. '

Over the years, however, food
companies convinced USDA offi-
cials that consumers were more
attracted to brand—name promo—
tions than generic advertising.
The General Accounting Office
and others question that claim.

“If brand name promotion is so
effective in expanding markets,"
says Schumer, “these companies
should pay for it on their own."

Mackie and other USDA ofﬁci-
'als back the brand-name theory.
Mackie says brand-name advertis-
ing is the best way to sell “high
value" products. or processed
foods such as frozen corn.

Under the Market Promotion
Program. the department gives
the money to agricultural trade
associations like the US.
Poultry and Egg Export Council
— but allows them to pass on
one-third of .the money to food
companies like Pillsbury. ~

It is those trade groups that
decide how much money each
company gets for brand—name
promotions, not taxpayers or the
Agriculture Department.

And although the USDA audits
spending by trade associations. it
has less luck with the companies.
USDA officials say they often
have no idea how much money
corporations receive for brand-
name promotions, what it‘s used
for or how successful the ad
campaigns are.

“We at one time attempted to
collect that information. but the
industry itself was very much
against it and prevented us from
collecting it." explained Wendell
Dennis, a USDA economist
whose job is to help evaluate the
program's effectiveness.

The department suggests that
you call the companies if you‘re
curious about how they're spend-
ing your money.

Try it. Here's what some of
them say:

U.S. producers finance promotional activities for 0.5. agricultural products”

 

HPP is similar to the Targeted Export Assistance (TEA) Program which was
repealed by the 1990 Farm Bill. The TEA program was limited to commodities
where exports had been adversely affected by unfair foreign trade practices.
Vhile those commodities must be considered a priority for participation in the
HPP, once their promotional needs are satisfied, consideration may be given to
assisting other commodity groups.

HOV THE PROGRAM VORKS--Under the HPP, surplus stocks or funds from the CCC are
used to partially reimburse agricultural organizations conducting specific
foreign market development projects for eligible products in specified
countries. Proposals for HPP programs are developed by trade organizations and
private firms and submitted to USDA by a deadline specified in the program ‘
announcement USDA publishes annually in the Federal Register.

 

After a program has been approved and announced by USDA, participating organiza—
tions or firms sign a program agreement with the CCC. The HPP participants then
submit activity plans to PAS describing specific activities and proposed
budgets, which are partially reimbursable with CCC funds or certificates.- To
date, the program has used generic commodity certificates exclusively. These
certificates can be redeemed for commodities from the CCC inventory or sold.

PROGRAM COVERAGE-~USDA has approved HPP programs to promote a wide variety of
0.8. commodities in almost every region of the world. Among the commodities
included are: nectarines, pears, plums, canned peaches and fruit cocktail,
table and concord grapes, apples, wood products, poultry and eggs, soybeans,
dried prunes, almonds, walnuts, raisins, fresh and processed citrus, rice,
frozen potatoes, confectionery and other processed food products, red meat,
salmon, avocados, kiwifruit, pistachios, sweet and tart cherries, processed
corn, wine, cotton, strawberries, hops, bourbon, bovine semen, dry beans, honey,
peanuts, mink pelts, ginseng, strawberries, dates, processed tomato products and
sunflowerseeds.

 

Activities financed by the programs vary from commodity to commodity, and

include activities such as market research, construction of a three—story wood
demonstration building, construction of a model feed mill, and consumer

promotion activities.

McWaste

US government wasting your tax mon-
‘ ey on ads for McDonald’s and other

big companies. It’s fine,‘ot' course, for these
' companies to advertise in our country and
abroad. Indeed, existing shackles on their
. .First Amendment rights should be removed,
‘ and the distinction between free, private
speech and unfree, “commercial” speech,
should be abolished.

But it passes Strange that the federal Agri-
culture Department gave 3465.000 of your
tax money last year to subsidize McDonald’s
commercials boosting Chicken McNuggets.
Other uses of your tax money, as uncovered
by the Associated Press from analysis of
documents acquired under a Freedom of In-
formation Act request: $150,000 to Campbell
Soup Co.. much of it to promote V8 juice
overseas; and $146,000 to Joseph E. Sea-
gram and Sons to promote Four Roses whis-
key.-—- even as US liquor taxes were in-
creased.

These ad campaigns were part of the Mar-
ket Promotion Program, funded with $200
million in taxpayers' money. The rationale
for this program is that we need to promote
Americangproducts abroad. Well, why can’t
. the companies themselves pick up the tab?
, Even though foreigners are not too keen on
. some US producm, they seem to be crazy
- about Big; Macs and Yankee whiskey.

‘ . complained Rep. Dick Armey of Texas:
“This is a classic example of welfare for the
; rich in the worst possible way. You go down
the list of companies and it's hard to imagine

Y on deserve a break today - from the

they need a handout from the American tax-
payer to market their products abroad. If
McDonald‘s needs help in marketing we
are in sad shape in this country."

US congressmen and businessmen com-
plain about subsidies foreign governments
give to homegrown companies. There are
two solutions: 1. Pressure those govern-
ments to end the subsidies. 2. End foolish
programs such as this one and refund the
money to taxpaying citizens and businesses.
The businesses could use the refunded mon-
ey to produce more goods. — or to increase
advertising — on their own, without interfer-
ence by government apparatchiks. And citi-
zens could use the money to buy more prod-
ucts, or to invest in productive companies.

This $200 million government McWaSIe
program is yet another example of how gov-
ernment has strayed far off course. It has
become an enemy of Americans’ true inter~
ests, taking their money to subsidize favored
special interests. Another recent program
has given US wheat to Russia. The program
is paid for by taxpayers. It also has reduced
the SUpply of wheat in America, thereby
causing the recent bOOSt in bread prices
here. Our government is robbing Peter to
pay Ivan —— or. rather, to keep Ivan in a
socialist system, instead of allow him to go it

alone and pressure the Russian government

to adOpt capitalism.

Next thing you know the US government
Will tax us to promote sales of US-distilled

vodka in Russia. 2/7/? 2

cided they do not mind the public see-
ing this big. fat, ugly, obnoxious wart
in the middle of American farm policy.
But insofar as anybody can vote for a
bill that takes our money for this pur-
pose, given our deficits, do not ever
come to the floor again and try to tell
me we need a farm program to ensure
a stable, safe. cheap food supply for the
American consumers or to help the
small family farm. -

“I’m sorry.” I say to my colleagues,
“but if you continue to fund the mar-
ket promotion plan as you do, you’ve
broken your cover. This is just a big
pork barrel for all the porkies that try
to get into Uncle Sam’s pocket. I think
you ought to be embarrassed about it
and get rid of it.”

Mr. MCHUGH. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from California (Mr. FAZIO].

(Mr. FAZIO asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)

Mr. FAZIO. Mr. Speaker, it is very
easy to be critical with quips and hu-
morous allusions about the MPP Pro-
gram. but I think the most important
thing for us to focus on is that it fills
a very real, GATT—acceptable need in
export promotion for value-added agri-
cultural products.

The first thing I think most of us do
not understand is that the European
‘ Community, a major agricultural com-
petitor in the international market. is
spending 81.5 billion in direct pro-
motional and advertising reyenue. We
are talking about spending something
close to SlSO‘milli'bn as a result of‘the
efforts of this subcommittee. It is just
a very minor contribution to the kind
of international competiton that we
face in agriculture. and of course this
is one of the most, productive areas of
our export economy. We have a $40 bil-
lion annual export sale from agri-
culture. We have a net balance of pay-
ment of :17 billion on the plus side in
this area of our economy, and. frankly.
it is one of those areas where we get
tremendous income for American
workers as a result of the efforts that
we make.

The gentleman from Texas (Mr.
ARMEY] was mentioning the efforts of
the McDonald’s Corp. and others who
have started stores to sell their prod-
ucts in Asia. McDonald’s, for example.
has 59 outlets in Hong Kong and 42 in
Singapore. The 812 million in sales of
American chicken to those facilities in
those two countries have created 3,780
jobs in the United States in 1991.

People also need to realize that these
dollars do not flow without a matching
amount of funds from businesses. large
and small, whether they are a small
businessman, like the actor that was
mentioned earlier. Paul Newman. who.
by the way. gives his profits to charity,
or whether or not they are a large co-
operative or corporation promoting ag-
ricultural sales overseas. They have to
match dollar for dollar the funds in the
program that is established within
USDA.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- HOUSE

Now the committee has understood
some of the criticisms that were lev-
eled at this program when the agricul-
tural appropriations bill was on the
floor several months ago. The report
language, which I think has been al—
luded to, goes a long way to requesting
a review of the program through the
Department with its participants, and I
am convinced that by the early part of
next year those problems that have
been identified around the margins can
be eliminated and the program can be
increasingly effective at promotion of
value-added agricultural products. in-
cluding, I might add. branded name
products. It is so important that we
not simply promote generically and
then lose the advantages of that adver-
tising and marketing revenue for
American producers by simply increas-
ing consumption of a product that may
well have been produced in some other
country. We have to be pragmatic and
practical about promotion of American
agricultural products.

I believe this committee has been
very supportive, as well as they could
have been given the other stresses and
strains that are imposed on this bill
this year, and I will be extending my
remarks in the RECORD so that we may
have even more evidence as to the
value of this very important program
for American agriculture.

Mr. Speaker. let me include the com-
ments of the Secretary in support of
this program. ’

DEPARTMENT or AGRICULTURE.
Washington. DC. June 23. 1992.

, Hon. VIC FAZIO.

House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.

DEAR VIC: I would like to take this oppor-
tunity to urge strongly that Congress con-
tinue funding for the Market Promotion Pro-
gram (MPP) at the two-million level pro-
vided in the President‘s FY 1993 budget. All
the statistics we have about US agriCul-
tural exports and all the current trends in
global agricultural trade suggest that a cut
in funding for the Department (USDA) Mar-
ket Promotion Program at this time would
be short-sighted.

High-value products constitute the fastest—
growing component of the world's agricul-
tural trade and by the end of this century
are expected to represent at least three—quar-
ters of world trade. In other words. the high-
value market is where future growth will be
for US farmers and exporters. More than 80
percent of MPP funding is targeted toward
building exports of high-value products.

If Congress were to reduce funding for the
MPP now. it would seriously jeopardize the
ability of US. agriculture to compete in this
vibrant sector of world trade. The European
Community (EC). our main competitor in the
high-value market, paid out direct subsidies
of nearly $1.5 billion to producers and export-
ers of high-value products in 1990. In addi-
tion. the EC and member governments also
offered their exporters many other indirect
subsidies. USDA’s saw-million annual pro-
gram level for MPP pales by comparison. but
it has been sufficient up until now to help
us. farmers and exporters boost their ex-
ports of high-value products. Such exports
have risen 75 percent since 1985. reaching a
recordchigh 319.9 billion in 1991. with another
record forecast this year.

The MPP also helps support the creative
market expansion work conducted by bulk

August 11, 1992

commodity producer organizations to con-
vince potential customers of the quality at-
tributes, new uses. and superior advantages
of US. farm products.

U.S. agricultural exports generated as a re-
sult of the MPP are directly responsible for
as many as 38,000 jobs on and off America‘s
farms and represent as much as $2.23 billion
in additional activity for the US. economy.

The MPP has had its critics however, and
I would like to address some of the main
points of controversy surrounding the pro-

gram. /

Some have claimed the MPP has not really
worked to help small exporters. This is not
true. however. Small businesses accounted
for 84 percent of the 287 firms participating
in the MPP last year. The goal of the MPP
is to increase agricultural exports as much
and as effectively as possible. Thus. neither
the law nor USDA discriminates by size of
company or type of ownership.

Some critics believe the US. Government
has no business promoting branded products.
The MPP however. promotes American food
and farm products. not American companies.
It is a fact of life that. if we are going to pro-
mote high-value—product sales, we are going
to have to promote branded products. Two-
thirds of the world’s high-value-products
trade consists of processed items; virtually
all of these are produced by branded compa-
nies. '

An exclusive focus on unbranded activities
runs the risk that generic demand can be
met by a non-US. supplier with a less expen-
sive. lower quality product. For high-value
commodities. US taxpayers may get a bet,
ter return on their investment with branded
promotions which build consumer loyalty to
a product containing American rather than
foreign commodities.

Others have asserted that tighter manage-
ment controls by USDA would allow the
MPP to be operated with less money. In re-
ality, both USDA and participants have .a
vested interest in running the MPP as effi-
ciently as possible because both have sub-
stantial sums of money invested.

The Department takes its role as guardian
of the taxpayers’ money very seriously. In
the last year, we have put in place new allo-
cation criteria that targets MPP funds so as
to receive the “biggest bang for the buck."
We are not renewing programs that have
proven not to be cost effective or that have
reached a plateau. We require all partici-
pants to submit comprehensive strategic
marketing plans and to evaluate the effeco
tiveness of every promotional activity. All
participants are subject to full. top-to—bot-
tom audits. Finally, we have published de-
tailed regulations to which all participants
must adhere and made other substantial
changes to tightsn management controls.

MPP participants also have a stake in effi-
cient program management since they are

-required to invest their own money in MPP
projects. In the case of branded promotions.
participants are required to put up at least
half ofthe cost of the MP? activity.

I appreciate this opportunity to set the
record straight on what the MPP really
means to US. agriculture and us. business.
Once again. I urge that Congress maintain
its commitment to expanding U.S. agricul-
tural exports by supporting the currently an-
thorised $200 million program level for MPP.

Sincerely,
EDWARD MADICAN,
Secretary.

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT

A message in writing from the Presi-
dent of the United States was commu-

 

 




August 11, 1992

So. farmers in this country are not
living high on the hog, and rural Amer-
ica is not doing all that well either.

But despite all of the negatives, there
is something positive to say about our
agriculture producers. In the United
States, we have the best fed, at the
lowest cost, people in the world.

I am proud of what our agricultural
producers do for a. living—and for our
country—that they work hard and are
thoughtful stewards of the land. I am
also proud of what is going on in rural
America—innovations in technologies
and education and new approaches to
affordable health care. ‘

I strongly urge my colleagues to con-
tinue the partnership that the Federal
Government has had with rural Amer-
ica by voting in favor of the conference

report today.

Mr. MCHUGH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Califor-
nia (Mr. Fame].

(Mr. FAZIO asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)

Mr. FAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to
join in the accolades that were directed
toward the gentleman from Mississippi
(Mr. WHI'I'I‘EN], the chairman of this
subcommittee for many years.

This has been a particularly tough
year, as has been pointed out in debate.
This bill is only 31.5 billion beyond last
year’s outlay funding. With the growth
of entitlements, particularly the
growth of the Food Stamp Program
during this recession, it shows that
this committee has been particularly

responsible in the way it has dealt with ,

the departmental programs, and of
course they are so important to the fu—
ture of American agriculture because it
is there that we get the increase in pro-
ductivity and acreage production.

So, Mr. Speaker, at this point I will
be revising and extending my remarks
in some depth on a number of pro-
grams, and, once again, I congratulate
this committee for the outstanding job
it did within the limited resources it

Additionally, the conference report provides

Mr. MYERS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker.
I yield 3 minutes to the farmer from
Texas, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
ARMEY). I could be stretching the
point.

Mr. ARMEY. Let me say, Mr. Speak-
er, I was bitterly disappointed to find
out that the conference returned to us

culture policy that should he more an
embarrassment to the advocates of
American agriculture policy, it is this
one.

This provision does nothing for small
American farmers. This provision does
nothing to guarantee American con-
sumers a stable, inexpensive food sup-
ply. This provision allows us to fund
overseas advertising for large agri-
business corporations. even retailing.
They have provisions here, and the way
they have allocated this money for
McDonald’s Corp., it is to advertise
Chicken McNuggets in Asia.

Now tell me how that helps the small
struggling American farmer.

Hershey Corp., which prides itself in
having built this wonderful American
success story without ever spending a
dime on advertising domestically is
dipping into the market promotion
fund to advertise abroad. Would they
do that without these free bucks from
the Government? I doubt it. I imagine
they would follow the same practices
internationally that they did domesti-
cally. .

U. S. STATE DEPARTMENT CABLE FROM JAPAN, EARLY DECEMBER 1992

1. Secretary. An "Action Committee to Deal with the Kyoto
International Whaling Commission [IWC] Conference" has been
formed by the Japanese fishing industry for the purpose of
promoting the resumption of commercial whaling and publicizing
the importance of whaling as an essential part of Japanese
culture which can be compatible with conservation of the
resource. In order to support the industry's activities, the
Fisheries Agency of Japan (FAJ) has established a headquarters to
deal with the Kyoto IWC conference. It is led by the . . . of
the Agency, . . . End summary.

2. Local news reports which we have corroborated with officials
of FAJ confirm that Japan is making extensive efforts to
influence opinion at the 45th meeting of the International
Whaling Commission in Kyoto on May 10-14 (?), 1993. On October
20 (?), 1992, twenty-four Japanese fisheries related
organizations fishing, whaling, fish and whale meat wholesalers,
labor unions, and citizens’ councils established an "Action
Committee to Deal with the Kyoto IWC Conference." Virtually
every significant fishing and fishermen's organization in Japan
is a member of the committee. In order to counter what is
perceived as substantial anti—whaling pressure by international
environmental groups, which the Action Committee fears will
become generalized anti-fishing sentiment, the committee has
established several broad-based objectives:

(1) Push for resumption of commercial whaling. The committee
believes now would be an opportune time to carry out such a
campaign because the Revised Management Procedure, the condition
precedent to a review of the moratorium on commercial whaling,
was completed at the 1992 IWC meeting, and (2) protection of the
Japanese fishing and culinary culture.

3. The membership, budget and proposed activities of the Action
Committee are as follows:

A. Secretariat:

B. Chairman:

Chairman, Citizens’ League for Protection of Whaling

C. Acting Chairmen (2):

Executive Director, Japan Fisheries Association

F. Budget:

A total of one hundred million Yen (approx. . . . dols). will be
raised by contributions from the member organizations and the
general public to support the committee.

G. Activities:

(1) Fund raising campaigns will be carried out on the street and

at special events by selling t-shirts with whale logos. A
portion of the proceeds will be contributed to UNICEF.

(2) Posters and pamphlets will be distributed to International
Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting.

Fisheries marketing facilities, public transportation networks,
public facilities (schools, museums and aquariums), and city
offices. .

(3) Local events will be organized from January to March 1993 at
coastal whaling cities such as Abashiri, . . ., . . ., . . ., . .
,., . . ., . . ., Nagato, and .

(4) Advanced PR in foreign countries and for foreign scientists
coming to Japan: Advertisements will be carried jointly with the
Ocean Trust of the U. S. in the leading foreign mass media.
Japanese public opinion leaders will be dispatched in an effort
to influence members of the IWC. Foreign whale scientists and
'anthropologists from Alaska, Britain, Canada, Iceland, Norway and
South Africa are scheduled to visit Japan in January- February
1993 at the invitation of the Japan Institute of Cetacean
Research to discuss the . . . importance of small— —type coastal
whaling and distinguish it from the large— —scale whaling
operations which prompted the moratorium.

(5) Activities planned for the Kyoto IWC meeting: . .

activities will be held in front of the Kyoto railway station and
the Kyoto conference hall. Foreign delegates to the Kyoto IWC
meeting will be invited to a reception where fish and whale meat
will be served while local cultural events including whale
dancing will be presented. Citizens of Kyoto will host an event
to familiarize delegates with whale culinary culture.

4. Comment. Apart from whalers, the whaling associations and
the large unions, most fishery related industries and '
associations in Japan have been indifferent to the whalers’ call
for resumption of commercial whaling. But things have changed
significantly as a result of what the Japanese see as their
success in defeating the Swedish proposal to add bluefin tuna to
the CITES list. Mr. Yamato . . ., President, Federation of Japan
Tuna Fisheries Cooperative Associations, said in an inaugural
meeting of the Action Committee that "We were successful in
defeating the Swedish proposal to include bluefin tuna in the
CITES list owing to cooperation by other fishing organizations
which have nothing to do with tuna fishing." The broad-based
participation of non-whaling organizations in this most recent
effort to save Japanese whaling implies that not only Whalers but
also fishermen generally sense an impending crisis at the hands
of international environmental organizations which are opposed to
fishing per se, not merely whaling. Fishermen see themselves as
the logical next target of the indiscriminate ideology of these
groups. End comment.

5. . . ., President, Citizen’s (?) League for Protection of
Japanese Whaling, delivered a speech as a guest at the inaugural
meeting of the Action Committee suggesting that, "We should aim
.at not only lifting the commercial whaling moratorium but also
securing 50 minke whales for our small-type coastal whaling."

6. The Fisheries Agency of Japan (FAJ) lost no time in following
the industry’s lead. On December 7 (?), 1992, FAJ formed a
17-member "Headquarters to Deal with the Kyoto IWC Meeting." FAJ
. . . heads the FAJ team, followed by Deputy Shima, 4 FAJ
Department Directors, Councillor of FAJ Department of Oceanic
Fisheries, 8 Division Directors, Counselor of FAJ-Department of
Oceanic Fisheries, and Chief, Office International Whaling
Commission (IWC) meeting.

. . . Overseas Fisheries Cooperation in the FAJ International
Affairs Division. A special Secretariat has been formed within
the FAJ Far Seas Fisheries Division with Mr. Ishimara Division’s
Deputy Directors as Secretary General. The Secretariat has a
staff of 9 officials including officials of the FAJ Whaling
Section.

7. On January 21, 1993 Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs is
expected to establish a special office to deal with the Kyoto IWC
meeting. . . .

ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION BY THE_DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

The Committee on Armed Services issued a report on
hearings held this Spring. Excerpts follow:

The committee is concerned about the DOD's
[Department of Defense] use of animals in
military experiments. The committee has heard
testimony that raises disturbing questions about
the necessity, ethical propriety, oversight and
quality of the military's experiments on animals.
Although the hearings focused on the use of
animals in biomedical research, the committee is
also concerned about the experiments on animals
by the department that are of a truly military
nature, such as in weapons testing and biological
warfare. '

To increase the department's accountability
to the Congress and the concerned public, the
committee directs that the Secretary of Defense
submit a comprehensive annual report to the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
House of Representatives on animal cost and use
programs. The report should provide in—depth
profiles of animal research (including testing,
education and training) conducted at each DOD .
facility. This information should be combined
with similar information about extramural
projects funded by the department to provide
comprehensive profiles of all animal research
conducted by or for each military service and for
the department as a whole. The report should
include descriptions of: (l) initiatives to
promote alternative methods that replace, reduce,
and refine the uses of animals in research; (2)
procedures to avoid unintended duplication of
research and unnecessary research; (3) the chain
of command over the animal care and use programs
from the individual facility to the Secretary of
Defense; and (4) the total cost of the animal
based research in comparison to other forms of
biological research conducted by the facility,
the military service, and the department as a
whole.

The committee also directs the Secretary to
establish aggressive and targeted programs that
replace, reduce, or refine current uses of
animals. [Emphasis added.]

The committee also recommends that an ombudsman

 




  

 

 

for animal issues be established at each animal
research facility. The purpose of the ombudsman
would be to field and act on any complaints and
concerns about the facility's animal care and use
program in an impartial manner.

The committee expects that animal advocates will
be appointed as the bona fide community members
to the animal care and use committees at each DOD
facility. [Emphasis added.]

Furthermore, the committee requests the
Department of Defense Inspector General to
conduct a review of every program, project, or
activity funded by the Department of Defense that
conducts any type of live animal research and
report on whether the animals used in each
program, project, or activity are handled and
treated in accordance with the Animal Welfare
Act, Department of Defense regulations, and rules
of basic humaneness that govern live animal
research.

Finally, the committee requests the General
Accounting Office (GAO) to conduct a review of
every prOgram, project, or activity funded by the
Department of Defense that conducts any type of
live animal research and issue a report on each
program, project or activity detailing the
purpose of the research, the number and types of
animals used, and the cost including the funding
level for the most recent year. The GAO should
identify overlap between the programs, projects
and activities and make recommendations as to
where funds could be saved.

 




DRAFT ARTICLE 0N RHINOS FOR.AWI QUARTERLY

The earth's rive rhinoceros Species, along with its other
endangered animals, may still have a chance to survive.
Hollowing years of inaction by the international community,
several animal welfare and conservation organizations are
calling on [all Americans] to send a strong and clear signal
to Taiwan, the main culprit in the illegal trade in rhino
horn, tigers, and many other endangered species.

the Animal welfare Institute, Environmental Investigation
Agency,‘Hunane Society of the united States, and Earth
Island Institute will launch a nationwide boycott of
Taiwanese brandname goods on March 1st to protest that
country's open violations of international wildlife laws.
The date of the launch will coincide with the 20th
anniversary celebration of the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES), the
united Hatione body which governs those laws, and which was
signed in Washington in 1973. The CITES Appendix I listing
grants international protection to the rhino and other
endangered species. ,

The "Boycott Taiwan" coalition is demanding that the
government of Taiwan to comply with CITES regulations,
including the international trade ban, as well as a recent
'resolution which calls on Taiwan and other consumer
countries to acquire and destroy stocks or rhino horn.
China, along with South Korea and Yemen are also reported to
be in current violation of the rhino horn trade ban. The
coalition will also urge Taiwan, which has one of the
largest reserves of foreign exchange in the world, to .
compensate some of the rhino range states which have spent
not only millions of dollars trying to save their national
heritage, but numerous human lives as well.

Those who wish to support this campaign should urge others
to stop buying goods "Made in Taiwan." You can also write
to your federal representatives and the Secretary of
Interior, Hr. Bruce Babbit, and ask them to support CITES
and its nunerous--hut all too often ignorode~rhino
resolutions. Any questions or suggestions for our campaign
can be directed to: [where?}

commune nonmamc or THE UN DRIFTNET mm

Since the United Nations ban on driftnet fishing became a reality
in December of 1991, The Coalition to End Global LargeHScale
Driftnet Fishing has been working to find ways in which the UN
and member states may work most effectively to enforce the ban.

There is great fear among member states that pirate driftnetters

will start operating under aesumed flags, with refitted vessels

and under contract from countries which may not be members of the ,J
UN, such as Taiwan. Several recent sightings have been reported

of Taiwanese vessels in the South and North Pacific and there is

evidence emerging that the Taiwanese are expanding their fleets

and directly reneging on their promise to decrease their existing

fleets and halt Operations altogether by December 31, 1992.

The Coalition’s Steering Committee recently travelled to New York
to promote the introduction of a formal registry of largemscale
pelagic driftnet fishing vessels from around the globe;
designation of the Law of the Sea Office as the deposit of
information relating to violations of Resolution 46/215: and
cooperation of member states to report sightings of suspected
driftnet vessels, as well as other pertinent information to the
U.N. Law of the Sea Office (L05).

The response among UN missions and the LOS office was genuinely
positive and it was agreed that a resolution to this effect must
be put forth in the very beginning of next years' General
Assembly.

As the deadline of December Si is rapidly approaching, it is
essential that we do everything possible to ensure that pirate
driftnetters do not flock to the most vulnerable regions of the
world and exploit those nations which have little or no
capabilities for enforcement for in own waters. moreover, it is
important to get the attention and involvement of those Us
federal agencies which may assist in-providing such services as

satellite and defense surveillance, processing of data and active
enforcement of the worldwide ban.

United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/215 sets a historic
precedent With its environmental nature and.we must make it clear

that it is not-enough to pass the ban; the dirty work is yet to
come. . '

ANIMALS REMAIN A? THE GRENADA 200

Less than thirty severely malnourished wild animals, victims of a
wildlife smuggler's trade, remain in a dilapidated zoo on the
Eastern Caribbean island of Grenada. The majority were stolen
off the Grenadine airport runway almost one year ago, as they
were making their way with almost 200 others to be cared for in
proper facilities in the United States. In 1990 and early 1991
the small, run~down zoo was being used as a stopping-off point by
wildlife trafficker Sadhu Lall—-twice convicted in the United
States for illegally importing endangered wild parrots. By time
Sadhu’s activities (which are suspected to also involve drug
trafficking) were effectively ended by the government last year,
only 200 remained'of an original 2.000 animals held at the
facility (see past AWI Quarterly issue--—-).

Presently Grenada’s new Minister of Agriculture, , has
asked the island's Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals (SPCA) for recommendations to deal with the remaining
animals. Though animals continue to die from starvation at the
zoo, the government had been reluctant to confiscate and export
them because they have no legal mandate to do so under Grenada
law; Grenada is not a member of CITES and only has one federal
animal welfare law, which has never been implemented. The
government has no financial or legal resources to counter a
potential lawsuit which Sadhu has threatened in order to regain
his lost capital.'

In the interim, British Airways and American Express have kindly
provided free transportation for animal feed provided by the
Animal Welfare Institute; volunteers of the GSPCA are
distributing the feed. The World Bird Sanctuary, a non~profit
organization located in Missouri, has offered once again to care
for the twentywnine animals, which include'macaws, Indonesian
lories, peacocks, mandarin ducks, and a lone monkey. A.single
pig, W911 fed by guards from the nearby prison offeringaﬂIEF
bananas, will be allowed to remain wandering the zoo.for
tourists' pleasure.

RHIN AND TI rERS DIE AS T

Rhinos are being pushed toward extinction by human activity faster than any ether land
mammal. ' Indeed, the world’s remaining five species of rhinoceros may be extinct in only
five years. The African black rhinoceros has declined from approximately 65,000 in 1970
to only 2,400 today that’s a decline of 96 percent in little more than twenty years! The
other {car rhino species are not faring any better only about 10,000 rhinos are left in the
world. The principal cause of this decline is poaching of rhinos for their horn which is
ground up and used as a traditional "fever-reducing" medicine in Taiwan, China, and South
Korea (there is no scientific evidence supporting its medicinal properties); the horn is also
carved into traditional dagger handles in Yemen. Rhino horn continues to be illegally traded
even though all five rhino species were placed on Appendix I of the Convention on
international Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), thus banning the legal international
trade in rhino horn among its (now) 117 member nations.

Investigations into the illegal trade in rhino horn indicate that Taiwan, in particular, can be
blamed for the decline of the rhino species. A very wealthy nation, wealth gained by selling
Taiwan exports here in the U.S.A., the Taiwanese can afford to buy the expensive rhino
horn drug which sells for up to $23,587 per pound. In Taiwan, horn is openly displayed and
sold to customers and the government does little to stop its trade. '

Investigations have also implicated Taiwan in the continuing destruction of other endangered
species, including'the world’s few tigers of which only 6,000 remain in the wild. Like the
rhino horn, tiger bones are used in traditional medicine in Taiwan. One Taiwanese company
advertised that it imports the bones of up to 100 tigers per year to make its product. At this
rate of use, it is thought that tigers, too, may become extinct by the end of the decade.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

Taiwan does not have an embassy in the US. because formal diplomatic relations do not
exist between our two countries. Instead there is a Coordination Council for North
American Affairs to which you could write to express your concern for rhinos and tigers (Mr.
Mou-shih Ding, Senior Representative, Coordination Council for North American Affairs,
4201 Wisconsin Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20016). Tell Mr. Ding that you want the
Taiwan government to strictly enforce a ban on the trade in endangered species, including
rhinos and tigers. And that the Taiwan government should donate money to help protect
rhinos and tigers from poachers.

Please also write your Senators (The Honorable , U.S. Senate, Washington, DC
20510) and Representative (The Honorable , US. House oi“ Representatives,
Washington, DC 20515). Ask them to ask the new administration to seek a suspension of
US. trade with Taiwan unless they strictly enforce a ban on the sale of endangered species.
including rhinos and tigers. Rhinos and tigers are protected by the US. Endangered Species
Act and the US. has signed the CITES treaty that bans their international trade. Thus,
Taiwan is undermining the good efforts made by the US. to save these species from

extinction.

These past weeks have been something
of a strain —- out of town, bouts with
flu and back problems -— therefore
had not been in touch. Soon, I hope

we can get togetﬁr in re: certain

I sent a few copies of "speech" around,
and have great replies. I thought you
would like to see a copy of Paul Brooks'
and his notation about her book chang—
ing the world.

The new format ( i.e. cover) is quite
striking. A real departure and surprise.
Might I suggest a table of contents box?

I hope you can refer to the Schweitzer—
