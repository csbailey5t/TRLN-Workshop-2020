When it comes to the Senate, the measure will certainly
have my earnest consideration.

Let me hear from you at any time.

Dear Merrill:

As you know, I__h;a_ve been working in behalf of funds
to meet all requirements of the Laboratory Animal Welfare
Act, and I am pleased to tell you that our Senate Appropriations
Committee today included in the fiscal year 1968 Agriculture
Appropriation Bill $1. 2 million to enable the Department of
Agriculture to proceed expeditiously with its responsibilities
under the Act. This is $900, 000 over the House allowance
and is, of course, in addition to the $325, 000 we included in
the Supplemental Appropriation for 1967 for administrative
expenses of the program.

Ibelieve we will be able to win Senate approval o_f___t_h9_
funds and I hope we can hold them in the joint Senate and House
conference committee on the Agriculture Appropriation Bill.

Dear Mrs. Durrett:
I am glad to have your letter in support of

humane treatment of animals used in research.

You will be interested to know that I worked

closely with the Humane Societies in securing adequate
quarters for the research animals of the Food and Drug
Administration. And under the Health Research Facilities
Construction Program of the Public Health Service some
20% of all funds expended have been for the improvement
of animal care facilities.

No hearings have been scheduled on S. 1071
pending receipt of a report on the bill from the Depart-

urged the Department to transmit the required report, and
I shall bring your letter and support of the bill to the

Dear Marion:
I am glad that you contacted me about Mrs. Frances

Frost‘s interest in the proposed legislation relating to humane
treatment and care of laboratory animals.

As you and Mrs. Frost know, I worked closely with
the humane societies in securing adequate quarters for the

research animals of the Food and Drug Administration. The
Senate Appropriations Subcommittee, of which I am Chairman,
provided the funds for the facilities. Also, under the Health
Research Facilities Construction Program of the United States
Public Health Service, some twenty per c__e_.r.1.t of all funds
expended have been useffor the improvement of animal care
facilities.

Please assure Mrs. Frost that I will certainly be
mindful of her support of S. 1071 and that I will also bring
her interest to the attention of my colleabues on the Senate
Labor and Public Welfare Committee.

_I__do hope that all goes well with you and send you
my kindest regards.
