1;. ,WASHINGTON, June 7
(AP)———Legislation intended to
assure the humane treatment of
cats, dogs: - and other“ animals
uSed for research was sent‘”to
the Senate floor today by its.
Commerce Committee.

The measure includes most

iaboratory purposes who fail to

‘ ment and ”care of the animals.

The Senate bill includes a re-.
quirement for laboratories and
research institutions to meet
the careand treatment require-
ments, ‘exCept “during actual re-
search or experimentation by a
research facility as determined

' by such research facility.”

DEB-Theft C I‘ackdowns :14

' By LEW SHARPLEY

A crackdoWn on dog-theft rings op-
erating in Kentucky, Tennessee and In-
diana is being planned. ' ~

Ponce in the three states have ordered
a “‘Dognaper Alert” at the request of
Mrs. Nellie Bond, secretary of the Ken-
tucky Association of Dog Clubs. cine.

“The legitimate use of dogs for genu-
ine scientific purposes has attracted
racketeers,” Mrs. Bond explained. “Not
only strays and- unclaimed dogs bought
from pounds,_ but many hunting, ,show
and pet dogs are being stolen from their

owners. and smuggled by the truckload.

for sale in the North and the East.”

Recently, in the Louisville area, an at-
tempt was made to steal an entire kennel
of toy show dogs. A truék was backed
up to 'the kennel door, but the “dog-
napers” "ﬂed-at the sight ofan armed
caretaker.

Near Shepherdsville, a Collie breeder
reported thatI12 dogs sold in the past
year have been stolen from the yards,
kennels ._ or homes of private owners in
six counties. Because of their friendly
disposition, Collies seem to be favorites
ofthe dognapers. Many dogs are trans-
ported and, then caged under inhumane
conditions,Linvestigators have revealed.

State Police Forces Alerted ;,,

The state police of Kentucky, Tennes-
see and Indiana, the Jefferson County
police and the Louisville Police Depart-
ment have been notified of the situation
and officials have promised to, instruct
all officers to be on the lookout for dog
thieves. . ‘ .

Drivers hauling truckloads, of dogs will
be asked to produce invoices, showing
where they got their car’gO'and] where
it is going. In suspicious circumstances,
proof “of ownership ~2 may be 5 demanded.

penalties would apply to? anyone know-
ingly possessing a stolen dog.

The 1954 Kentucky dog law merely
declares dogs to be personal property,
the .theft of which is punishable under
the larceny laws. The Peace bill would
require certain penalties.

“The penalty asked is too severe,”
one capital observerremarked. '

However, Gerry Voyles, LOuisville
Kennel Club board chairman, said: “Any-
one willfully stealing a dog ought to con-
sider himself lucky if he isn’t shot.”

500 Trophies Offered

Over 500 trophies and cash prizes total-
ing $700 will be awarded at the Louis-
ville Kennel Club all-breed show Feb.
27, Dr. Pearl E. LeMay,-tr0phy commit-
tee chairman, announced.

Many trophies also are offered in the
shows to be held by the Cocker Spaniel
Club of Kentucky and the Collie Club
of Kentucky. Feb. 26, in the Buechel
Armory and the State Exposition Center,

respectively.

Collie entry blanks can be obtained
from Mrs. Jack Goldstein, 2609 McCoy

tary, Mrs. Frank McLaughlin, 417 Wood-

The Animal Cruelty Bills

Congress at laSt is headed toward
enactment of a law to require humane
treatment of animals used in laboratory

research and to halt thefts of pets by

dealers supplying this market
At the eleventh hour, however, a

snag has been encountered in the senate '

Commerce Committe.Medica1 research-
ers, hostile to government supervision,

(but not government grants, it should -'

be added), are attempting a switch
f play. A bill introduced by Senator Hill
of Alabama would head off federal in-
spection of how laboratories treat ani-
mals awaiting experiments Instead this
authority Would be given to a private
group '

' The medical men,- in fact,- have such
a group all ready and waiting Set up

last year, it is called the American As- ,

. 80ciatiori for Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care; Its members are of the
establishment; all are Staff members

of medical schools and research institu-,'

tions. And, as the aesociation’ s brochure

suggests the “inspections” would be

rather friendly affairs.

There would be no surprise audits,
such as those routinely carried out now
.‘1n the banking industry, for example.

Instead a visit Would be scheduled by ,
It would not 1'
come distress1ngly often—no more than ,
. once every five years. The inspectors,’

“m’utual convenience

according to the brochure, would Charge

fees ranging up to $1, 000 for their
trouble. . -

If the laboratories are in fact treat—i

a 1ng their animals humanely, they Should:

l have nothing to fear from a proposal by

Senator Magnuson of Washington that

such inspections be made be the De-
partment of Agriculture after standards
have been published. His bill has

,nothing to do with the anti- vivisection- ._

ists; the government would not interfere ii

‘ With any laboratory tests or Operations.

Certainly the public should not be

' deluded into thinking the'Hill propOsal

represents any kind of adequate sub-
situte for impartial inspection of such

institutions.

‘PETS T.HEFT j/g 9/5!
‘ Animal Proposal

-.w» ,@
Passes ‘ enate .,‘

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The pet animals for use in research
Senate passed 85-0 Wednesday a and to require greater care of
bill designed to prevent theft 3f research animals.

, The unanimous action sent the
measure back to the House
which had passed a similar ver-
sion. The bill would authorize
the secretary of agriculture to
regulate the transportation, sale
and handling of dogs, cats and,
other animals to be used in re-
search or experimentation.

 

I The purpose of the measure,
the Senate was told, is three-
fold: .

1. To protect owners of cats
and dogs from theft of their
pets. ‘

2. To prevent the use or sale
of stolen dogs or cats for pur-
poses of research. '

3. To establish “humane

standards” for treatment of ani—
mals —- including rabbits, ham-
sters and guinea pigs —— by ani-
mal research and medical facil-
ities. .
The measure would require
licensing of animal dealers by
the secretary of agriculture and
make itvillegal for a research
facility to buy animals from
anyone but a licensed dealer.

It would direct the secretary
of agriculture to promulgate
standards, including thOSe cov»
ering handling, care and trans:
portation of animals except dur-
ing actual research or experi-
mentation. , l

The measure would authorize '
the Agriculture Department to
make inspections to insure com-
pliance with the measure, pro-
vide criminal penalties for “vio—
latiOn of the act by dealers, and
suspension and revocation of a
dealer’s license. In the case of
violations by a research facility,
the AgriCulture Department
could apply for a cease and de-
sist order. . ,

The criminal penalty would be
imprisonment of net more than
one year or a fine of not more.
than $1,000 or both.

REGULATION OF. TRANSPORTA-
TION, SALE, AND HANDLING OF
ANEMUS INTENDED FOR PUR—
PosEs OF RESEARCH AND EX-
PERIMENTATION

Mr. SCOTT. Madam President, I in-
troduce, for appropriate reference, a bill
to regulate the transportation, sale and
handling of dogs, cats, and other animals
intended to be used for purposes of re~
search and experimentation.

My bill is designed to put the cruel and
inhumane “dognapers” out of business.
It would outlaw the purchase or trans-
port of dogs, cats, or other animals in
interstate commerce by research facili-
ties unless these facilities were licensed
by the Secretary of Agriculture for this
purpose. It would also outlaw the sale
or transport of these animals in inter-
state commerce by unlicensed dealers to
research facilities. Administration and

 

implementation of this legislation would

W

 




5000 “ cor

be vested in the Secretary of Agricul-
ture. . .

This proposed legislation would in no
way impede the legitimate use of ani-
mals in medical research. It is designed
to stop the “dognapers.”

Americans are rightly shocked and in-
dignant at the gruesome stories of dog-~-.
naping which have been" brought to
their attention recently. This racket is
lucrative. Dognapers buy these inno-
cent animals at low prices, or in many
cases steal them outright. Then they sell

‘the dogs to medical research institu-
tions which have a continuing need for
animals for experimental and research
purposes. In the process of being held
and later transferred to their new own-
ers, the medical research institutions,
these dogs and cats are often subjected
to brutal and inhumane conditions.
‘ This shocking situation must be ended,
Madam President. It can be, by the en-
actment of legislation to outlaw the dog-
naping racket.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The bill will be received and ap-
propriately referred.

The bill (S. 3059) to authorize the Sec-
retary of Agriculture to regulate the
transportation, sale, and handling of
dogs, cats, and other animals intended
to be used for purposes of research or

Animal Protection 4/2 3/gg

The Senate Commerce Committee has, in a
humane way, taken the bull by the horns so to,
speak and put the brand of its approval on a solid,
sensible bill to protect research animals from need—
less, wanton cruelty. Its bill, introduced by Sena-
tor Magnuson and measurably strengthened by
Senator Monroney’s amendment, ist markedly su-
gperior to the animal ‘care measure passed by the
House. We hope that the Senate will give it
speedy endorsement and that the House will accede
to its wise humanenes's.

The Senate Commerce Committee billwould re-
quire laboratories, animal dealers and persons
transporting. animals to- be used in scientiﬁc re-
search to Observe certain elementary standards
to be set by the Secretary of Agriculture for the

for experimentation.- The standards would be de-
signed to deter the stealing of pets for sale to“ lab-
oratories and to require giving them decent shel-
ter, ventilation, Mnitation, food and water. The
legislation would not limit or affect actual use of
the animals for scientific experimentation in any
way.

There is not a syllable in this bill that can be
Said to impair or impede research. It is not anti-
viviseotionist, or antimedioal or antiscientific or
anti- anything save senseless neglect and brutality.
It amounts to no more than a simple expressioh
of humanity.

WASHINGTON’—On some
mornings the well-drESSed,
clean-shaven Si'Xsfoot‘er left
for the Office just like many
other family breadwinners in
suburban Washington. But
other mornings, he would
leave , unshaveh,.. roughly
dressed 4' - in jeans, icowboy
Debts and worn windbreak-
er. And the neighbors won-
'déred - and whispered

something hush-hum,
they figured, but what? '-
‘ On those unshaven days,

Declan Hogan, 26, was on

his way to get the goods'on
dog and cat dealers and
thieves preying on the pets
of thousands of American
families, and the sensibili-
ties of millions more.

'" In particular, he was after ‘

dealers who mistreat ans
mals —— obtained for sale to
research labsathrough‘ neg-
lect and virtual starvation-

This hard-tc—unccver evi-
dence, often hidden aWay oft
country roads, is helping to
speed into law provisions of

27“ bills introduced in Con- 1'

gress. Such legislation will
cruh .“petnaping” and com-
pel dealers ‘m and possibly
research. facilities, too - to
meet government standards
of kindness .and decency.
None of these bills, aspre-
sently worded. affects the
use of animals under actual
é’iqierimentation. (Other bills
have been intrOduced to re-
gulate this phase.) '

‘ “I figure,” the lanky New
York-born Mr. Hogan told
two congressional commit-
tees— recently, “that half the
dogs Supplied by dealers are
stolen” He admits he can-
not prove this, because ani-
mals, unless tattooed, carry
no permanent identification.

ciety of the United States

being acquired at the cost
of more than $30 million an

mates or humane addicties
and members of Congress.

When Hogan, a former
{restaurant operator and fa-
ther of two pre-school chil-

3' dren, took the job he had no
previous experience in hu-

mane work. He admits, “I
was a bit skeptical of those
seemingly fantastic claims
of cruelty to animals.”

Nearly 2milion dogs and .
some half million cats are ,

 

But his very earliest re- "

 

Americans across the land have been
sickened by tales of horror in the treat-
ment of dogs, cats, and other pets by un-
sorupulous animaldealers who sell them

j to research laboratories. It’s, estimated

ried paragraphs. such as
these:

“I purchased two collie
shepherds for three dollars.
These dogs were in small
chicken coops and When I

removed them they could
hardly walk.’

“Conditions were outrage-
ous -— 15 to 20 dogs in five-

by-«six root bins—little dogs
f in With the big, who ate up
. the food thrown in— usu-

ally slaughter-house entrails:

some of the dogs were col-

lars and license tags.

“At the Manheim, Pa., ’
dog and cat auction, I saw
dogs and cats soldrby the -

pound. ,One dealer, known
only as No. '10, purchased
about 20 dogs, 30 cats, sev-r
eral guinea pigs, some rab-

bits,.and one goat for $13. ;-~
Chicken crates were used

to store the animals on the '

" he used to have a $15,000-

Repeated Visits to dealers _

as a dealer-thief set the

stage for police raids. Capt.

THIS WEEK, State Police and U. S
Humane Society officials raided a‘
junk yard in Baltimore and found 103 ,

dogs in various states of agony. A man
in charge of the dogs was arrested
and charged with 28 counts of cruelty
to animals.

This is just one instance of a too
little noticed immoral practice that is
associated with keeping you, a human
being, in better health. .

: - justify obtaining a warrant from a Gettysburg ‘

Justice of the Peace. Then they decided to
make a second trip. ‘ - , '

Sanctuary. A platoon of ducks exercised stiffly
around a pond. Some doves peaked at seeds in
the spare grass.

“Sometimes we get hawks,” Hudson said.
“We get all kinds of birds. People bring them in
with broken wings. Last week We had an owl
We give them care, then take them to their
natural environment and release them.” .

Back in the buildings HudSOn strolled

. through the maternity ward where pups were
about to be born. He passed encIOSures with
- assorted dogs.

“Some are strays,” he said. “We keep them

; for a while and if nobody claims. them and

nobody adopts them we have to put them. to
sleep. It’s a sad thing. People Want dags while

' they’ re puppies, but the pups grow into dogs
. p. . and when the people find having a dog is a
. '. . f“ responsibility, they throw them out.”

THE OTHER members of the raiding Crew

had arrived and were waiting at the car. They

' were Ted Uerkvitz, the SPCA’s chief agent,
.thickset, tough, quiet-spoken; and Dr. James

M. Penny, a tall, athletic-looking veterinarian.
“All set?” said Hudson. “Let’s go. ” '
0n the way, the men talked shop. Hudson

mentioned five dead cows he’d found on a tour

the day before, out in ChesterCounty.




 

 

oioﬁn woo Aq sqdmboioqd‘

— Primitive dag houses dot the bleak
expanse of farm visited by agents.
Over the scene rose the chorus

of a hundred dogs—yelping, howling. .

(

remembers from being a pup—how his mother
picked him up and shook him when he mis-
behaved. . But it spoils some dogs for good.
They won’t be aggressive. even when you want.
them to protect you.”

The men Stopped brieﬂy for doughnuts and
coffee, then . continued ‘the drive along the
Turnpike. Hudson took what looked like a
fountain pen from his pocket.

“You press here” (he indicated a button).

“and it squirts tear gas up to twenty feet. It
doesn’t hurt a dog, but it changes his mind.”

They pulled up at the State Police Station

just outside Gettysburg. ...—.

~ “Now,” Hudson said,‘ ‘we Didi up a state.

trooper and we’ re on our way to the farm.’

Picking up the-trooper proved more com— "4
plicated than the SPCA men had expected. The “
. State Police sergeant was. a cautious man. He
fingered the warrant Uerkvitz had proffered

him.-
“You better see the district attorney,” he

said.
The SPCA men left. When they returned to

the station, two-and-a—half hours later, they .

looked angry.

“He talked to us a bit and we settled
nothing. Then he made us sit there and wait
while he had his lunch,” Hudson said of the
D.A. “Then he told his secretary to tell us he

‘ couldn’t see us again because hehad to go out.”

They had driven over to Gettysburg to see
the Justice of the Peace who had issued the
warrant and, after much legalistic argument,
the J. P. had consented to issuing an amended
warrant.

“This means,” Uerkvitz said,‘ ‘we can look
around the farm but we can’t go inside the
house.”

There followed another, rather heated

said “H’ya boy?”

The dogs, the adult ones, now came mto
view. Some were loose, most were tied up, out-
side primitive dog houses made of wood and

‘metal.

”‘

.In front of the farm house stood the farmer’s
wife. She was grayhaired and Small. She wore a
red and black checkered hunting jacket, anold
tweedy skirt, white boots and a hunter’s cap
Her eyes ﬂashed with indignation. ' '

“Sara,” said the trooper, “those men are /

from the SPCA. They want to look around the

place. There’s been a complaint about the 1’ .

dogs. 7 .
“My husband’s out,” she said. “I don’t go ' I

.. with these people coming in and taking over

the place. I reckon they have no right. It
doesn’t seem the right thing to do.”

The trooper was young and friendly. He had
known the farmers since he was a bOy. ~

“Sara,” he said, “they have a warrant.
They can look over the farm, but you don’t
have to let them in the house.”

“Well,” she said, “I just don’t like strangers
barging 1n here and taking over.”

A rangy young man in dungareos drove up
in a truck. '

“That’s my] son,” the farmer’s wife said.
“He’ll handle this matter.” , a.

Uerkvitz stepped up and began to read the
warrant. The farmer’s son listened in silence.
Then he spoke slowly

“This may not be the best run farm in
the state,” he said. “But it’s not the worst-
You people have no call to come in here, I don’t

I think.”

Hudson reddened.

 




 

“They had just starved to death,” hesaid.

“But some calves were alive. They’d sucked the
last drop of milk from their mothers, so they

survived ”
Uerkvitz remarked that m a popularity con-

test, SPCA agents would probably come out
last.

“Many people think we’re just a bunch of
weepy-eyed do-gooders, ” he ’said. “They see us
coming and say, ‘Look, here come those jerks
again, the bleeding hearts.’ ”

“Sure,” the doctor said. “They forget that

a crack at a human being.”

“Right,” said Hudson. “The thing 1s, if we
didn’t do it, nobody would. Somebody has to
care, because animals have rights, too. They
can’t speak for themselves.”

“Did you ever get jumped by a dog?”
Uerkvitz asked Hudson.

“I did,” said Hudson. “It isn’t pleasant.
Best thing to do is try to bring your knee up
7 and hit the dog in the chest. It knocks him off
balance because it knocks the wind out of him.
But, of course, you don’t always have time to
do that.”

“One good way,” the doctor said,‘ ‘is' to grab
the dog by the loose skin behind his ears and
shake him..It discOurages the dog from biting.
It is probably something psychological the dog

debate With the State Police sergeant who told
the SPCA men, “Now let’s not get hard-nosed
about this,” but ﬁnally assigned one of his men
to go along.

“We don’t give up easily,” said Hudson,
back in the car. “In fact, we don’t give up at
all. Some places we get cooperation from the
authorities, other places we don’ t. This place
we didn’t. They tried to get rid of us, but we
got the warrant. Right?” 1

The others agreed that was so and the car
followed the trooper’s vehicle.

THEY REACHED the farm in mid-after-
noon. A wooden gate barred the way and the
cars stopped and the men got out and put on
their boots.

“Gad, I’m hungry,” the doctonsaid.

“So am I,” said Hudson.

“Me, too,” said Uerkvitz. “You never know
when you can eat on this job. ”

They opened the gate and slowly walked up
what had once been a path but was now a
loamy, slippery channel.

The place looked like a junk yard. Broken

wheels, rusting car parts, refuse littered the

vast expanse of land.
Suddenly a great howl broke the stillness,a
hundred dogs yelping, howling, barking up and

then, down the rutted road, came a solitary .

“What about these animals?” he asked
severely. “What about those poor dogs?”
“You won’t find no hungry dogs here,” the

farmer’s son said.
“That’s right,” seconded his mother. “N o

’ hungry dogs at all. We feed them every day, ‘

stuff from the slaughter house, good stuff.”

The SPCA men slowly strolled about the

, farm. The mastiff kept up a menacing roar, oc-

casionally worrying the dead donkey. The men.

aimed ﬂashlights into the doghouses scattered

everywhere.
They found, in one, the carcass of a pup

' without a head. They also found a couple of

other dead dogs. Each time Hudson muttered
angrily to himself, “A disgrace.” «

FrOm behind a pile of rubble came a whim A

Ipering sound. It came from a light-gray setter.

He was straining at his collar and he must have "

been straining quite a while because his neck
was bloody and raw.

The doctor crouched down 1n the mud and
examined the wound. Then he wrote in his note-

book, “deep laceration due to tight collar?” ' j ..

carefully picking their way between small I .h ,.

Many of the dogs had water buckets

from the dogs. .

“What’s so hard about giving these
dogs water?” Hudson asked the farmer’s
son with some exasperation.

“The dogs knock the buckets over,” he
grumbled. “Can’t be after them damn
dogs all day.” ‘ . -

There was a commotion, a beating of
wings.

“They’re at it again,” said the farmer’s

wife. “Those game cocks.”
Two roosters were tearing at each other

“My husband had an attack—I’m glad
he ain’t here to see these people'taking
over the place—~and he can’t work so
' much any more. My son and I have to do
it, and it’s a big place to keep up.”

The dogs, she said, were just a sideline
for them. Mainly, the farm sells sheep and
hens and an occasional pony for kids to
ride. The dogs, she said, go 'to hospitals

for research, but some are bought by 'chil-
dren as pets. ‘ . “ '

“It’s not easy to sell a dog to hos-

As much as: we like peace, as much as
ch We

port them, as much as we are a people
content to go your way and let others .do
likewise, we know that to be able to live

’ in peacerto let our young men develop
their minds and bodies in peaceful pur- -

suits, to mind our own business, We must
not let aggression run rampant across
the seas.

When missiles based halfway round’

the globe are less than 30 minutes from
this Chamber, we are not safe in with.-
drawal. When a supposedly civilized
nation,‘which possesses a rudimentary

atomic bomb, is. so irresponsible as to

loose perhaps a million young hooligans
.onto its citizens. to root out every sign

of dissent, ‘yes, even onto humiliating

and ultimately destroying- those dedi- '
cated to God’s work in their country, can .'

we sit back and allow that“‘country to”
conquer its neighbors by proxy?.
This Congress has made clear that it
knows the answer to these questions.
By itsactions, by its deeds, it has said
to friends and foe. alike—“J‘this Congress
backs our President.” 7 ' S ” "
It has done so by providing for a
strong Defense Establishment.
j Both'Hous‘es have early agreed on the
ﬁgure for the ﬁ8cal 1967 defense appro-
priation bill, HR. 15941, and only a dis-
agreement over a subsidiary matter stood
in the way of sending it to the President.

, The amount‘appropriated was $58,067,-

412,00‘0, which may be compared with the
‘ argest single money bill ever voted, that
forthe ﬁscal 1944 defense appropriation

of $59.34billion. Only a portion of these

not and will not stand in the way .of

ﬁeld... . . , . , .g
As to ‘that matter of. the subsidiary
disagreement, the authorization for the
President to call up certain reservists,
our enemies and the doubters may de-

1 .

. rive” no comfort on that score either.

‘ The House, cf Representatives , passed a

stand against ChineSe and North Viet- -
namese aggression are .not hard to ﬁnd.
In March, we passed bills authorizing
supplemental appropriations for ﬁscal
1966—$4.8 billion for military procure-
ment and $415 million for economic 'as-
sistance, $275 million of the latter in-
tended for Vietnam. ‘r -

Members could have 'v had no doubt as
to- the effects of our votes and neither
could the Communists. As I said during
the debate on the military procurement
supplemental : .
[I]n 'voting for this bill today, I am voting
not only for this bill but am also voting
again for the resolution that we adoptedgon
,August 10, 1964, which was adopted by an
overWhelming majority of both branches of
Congress. Thus, we will convey to the actual

and potential enemy and also the rest of
the World that America is united ‘

. Later in March, we enacted a supple-
mental defense appropriation measure
for ﬁscal 1966, totaling $13,135,719,ooo.
Again, there could have been no doubt
that our vote was one to strengthen the
President in his quest for peace in Viet-
nam. In reduesting the funds, he noted
that $12.3 billion would go to provide for
-' the operations of our men in Vietnam

end he reiterated what he had said be-

r ore: .;

Until peace comes, ' or if it does not

come . . . we will give our ﬁghting men what _
they must have: every gun, .every dollar,

and- eVery decision—whatever the cost or
whatever the challenge.

g . A major nonmilitary step to help
secure the peace in Asia this year was our
enactment of a .bill providing for ~,U.SI._V
participation in the Asian Development
Bank, which‘will foster economic grewth
and stability in that area by making and

a, guaranteeing loans for-prIVate enterprise
‘ and public .facilitiesj'in ASian countries.

‘ _~._ There Will be particular attention paid to

those'cOuntries along an arc of freedom
" that borders the Soviet Union and Com-
. munist China from the 'Caspian Sea to
Korea. ‘ . g. g ' "
It is too well known that communism
and other totalitarian forms of govern-I
~ments thrive on the want and despair
. so prevalent in the underdeveloped areas.
The Development Bank, ,a truly multi-
lateral agency, will 'be one unit in the
continuing struggle to alleviate the'suf-
ferings of the millions and to help make
realizable the: revolution 'of. rising ex-
pectationspa '. . ..'. ,
In that effort, We have Continued to
support our program of military and eco-
nomic asSista'nce to the underdeveloped
areas'of the World. ,fWe have not per-

. ' mitted thebccasion'ab’error in judgment,

.- inevitable in-aprogram, of. this magni-
, tude, to deter us from perservering in our
utilization of thiSRtype: of , assistance in
. striving for-peace. 'By‘= and large, the
record is‘a splendid one. g ' .
This year witnessed‘What appears to be
;, a‘growing frustration with the program
by some Membersl _ Consequently, the .
total -.appropriated was $2.94 billion, the
loWest in the last 9 years and $443.4 mil-

There seems little 'doubt that :in the

freedom is fragile if citizens are ignorant.

_‘_Our former, Commissioner of Educa-
tion, Mr. Francis Kep-pel, has told us that
the ﬁrst goal of our educational programs

, must be to raise the quality of education

in our schools eyerywhere and for every-

4 one; .we cannot tolerate second-class edu-

cation if we intend to remain a ﬁrst-class
Nation. ' V '
This Congress, the 1st and 2d seSsions,
and the 88th Congress made an impres-
sive start toward achieving that goal.
[The Headstart program has been an
enormous success. It is designed to reach
presChool children in the 3-to—5 age
group who come from backgrounds which
deny them an equal start with other chil-
dren at the beginning of school. In order '
to break the cycle of poverty, the pro-

gram provides these children'from eco..
'nomically deprived neighborhoods with

the educational, social, ,_ cultural, and
"medical attention needed to bring them
up to the starting level of . more advan-

taged children.

The results have been startling in
terms of the increased 162' rates, in-
creased iearning ability, self-conﬁdence,
and classroom adjustment. » , ,
These results are, however, only the
beginning. Less than 30 perCent of our

" ‘poorchildren were affected last year \bY

Headstart. ~ ConseQuently, this year the

- Congress 7 substantially. increased the

funds under title II ofthe Economic Op-
portunity Act and authorized $352 mil.

Congress has also considered amend-
ments to the‘Higher Education Act. In
1963, we authorized a 5-year program of
grants and loans for the censtruction' of
undergraduate and graduate facilities.
Last year, Congress enacted the Higher
Education Act-of 1965 which not- only
provided a program of grants to assist
in the strengthening of developing
highereducation institutions, but pre-
sented a broad-gaged challenge to all
colleges, and assistance in meeting the

challenge, in the areas of community
service and continuing eduCation, college '

libraries and library training and “re-
Search, ﬁnancial aSSistance to students,

teacher programs, improvement of un- '
dergraduate instruction and academic ‘

facilities. This year the President pro-
posed a 3-year extension, of the 1963
act; and in 'action taken shortly be-
fore adjournment, the Congress voted a
$3.97 billion authorization that extends
and broadens these programs of assist-
" ance for graduate and undergraduate
faculties. ‘ f . ‘ '
. Importantly, thePresident asked for a
step-up in the program of aesistance to

much so that in both Houses last year
there were only 8 votes cast against sub-'

of 468 in favor.' This year, Congress
worked on amendments to establish new
training programs, broaden eligibility
for referral to’ existing programs and
proVide greater ﬂexibility in the allo-
cation of training allowances. This
House passed an amending bill which
'was adopted unchanged by the Senate.
These amendments will facilitate a more

On February 1, 1967, the Federal mini-
mum wage will increase from the present
$1.25 to $1.40, and a year later it will go
to $1.60. Coverage under the act was

”extended to. about 8.1 million additional

workers, including ' those ,on corporate

Of all‘ workers,- agricultural workers
have been the most neglected in terms
of laws dealing with wages and hours,
health and sanitation, unemployment
insurance, workmen’s compensation, and
collective bargaining. That is changing.
As Secretary Wirtz said recently: ‘-

‘ There may havebeen sounder reasons in

3 some earlier period for the arguments that

agriculture deserves, for some unidentiﬁed
reason a government-guaranteed foreign
labor supply, that normal personnel policies
don’tapply here, that the farm produce mar-

The Federal Government supports or
regulates almost every means cf trans-
pOrtation. , Last year alone, more than $5
billion in Federal funds were inVested in
transportation—highway construction,
river and harbor development, airWay
operation and airport j' construction,
maritimé subsidies. ‘ ' ‘

Now, coordination will be exercised.
Conﬂicting policies will be resolved. . A
balanced transportation system g can be
the result. The problems can now be at-
tacked—the croWded freeways and
clOgged' dOwntown streets, the disap-
pearance of passenger service on trains
when there is hope for highspeed rail
tranSpOrtation between our large cities,
the "overcrowded skies, the state of our "
merchant marine. Now there is hope.

The Urban Mass Transportation Act of '
.1964 provided, for the ﬁrst time, for Fed-g '
eral grants to State and local bodies to
help in purchasing facilities necessary
for urban mass transportation. This
year, Congress extended the act for 3

.years and authorized appropriations of

$150 million in each of the ﬁscal 1968 and
1969. We Talso expanded the act byjau-
thorizing more basic research and. plan-
ningin the ﬁeld, and we also authorized
the secretary of HUD to prepare a re-
searchf and demonstration program 0fg

‘ improved mass transportation systems.

"Millions of Americans who daily fume
in enromous trafﬁc jams will look to us
in relief and gratitude. ' ' z j .»

They will look to us for another reason
alone. This year, Congress made a con-
certed attack on the problem of automo-
bile safety. We directed the Secretary of
Commerce to establish Federal motor ve-
hicle standards, which will be effective
for 1968 models. There will also be Fed—

I In addition to trafﬁc jams, dirty air
and water, and other detriments, our in-.
creasingly urban society 'with its com-
plex economies has led to a growing
problem to which every housewife could
eloquently address herself, I am sure.
This . involVes the so-called packaging
revolutibn. ' Packaged and processed
foods, quiokfrozen and prepared foods,
numberless things in packages,and the
concomitant advertising have brought
us mixed blessings. On the one hand,
they are a' source of great convenience
andsaving; on the other hand, trying
to, sort out which is "the best buy and
trying not to get burnedIIby‘ packaged
frauds is, a continual frustration.

To give the housewife a hand, the Con-
gress passed truth-in-packaging legisla-
tion, and while it may not go as far as
‘Somewish, it does authorize the estab-
lishment of Federal'standards to prevent
unfair or deceptive packaging and label-
ing practices. It should prove beneﬁcial
in helping our womenfolk in the family
shopping.‘ ‘. . .

I have heard with some amusement
the claims by industry .representatives
‘thatwe did not need to pass this legisla-
tion because, after all, women are shrewd
and crafty shoppers who could not be
taken in. Without in any mannerdoubt-

This year represented a period iri'
which .Con ress waited to see what
changes we Ihould make in last year’s
programs. ' -

We did, however, establish a new pro-
gram of cotton research, development,
and promotion that will permit cotton to
compete with synthetic ﬁbers in the
market. And we enacted a program to
permit farmers to plant alternate crops
on lands on which natural disasters had
prevented the planting of cotton, wheat,
of feed grains, and still remain eligible
for Federal supDOrt payments.

The - food-for-peace program will
prove even more beneﬁcial to American
farmers in the future in-its stimulus of .
new foreign markets. _.

This Congress has made other ad-
vances, initiated other legislative activi-
ties, plowed new ground.

We granted pay raises to. Federal em-
ployees.-_ . » . - .

We enacted a comprehensive freedom
of information bill so that citizens may
have access to Government information .
that concerns them. .. , '

We amended theIFederal Hazardous
Substances Labeling Act of 1960 to pro-
tect the health and safety of our chil-
dren. ‘ ' ‘

e passed anIact to protect” our pets
from thievery which had been increasing
as unscrupulous dealers met the growing

to take an active interest in the party of
his choice. For too long our political

parties have relied on large contributions

by the “fat cats. ” This bill will help to
come it."

Lastly, this Congress met our respon-
sibilities in the area of Government ﬁ-'-
nance. Early in the year We enacted a
measure to make withholding taxes pro-
gressive, Which acComplished the dual

purposes of adding to the Government's

revenues then and of avoiding the bur-
den on most taxpayers Of paying one
lump sum at '_the end of the year. And
We deferred the reduction of some excise
taxes. 5

And just recently we passed a bill:

temporarily suspending the investment
credit and depreciation schedules so as
to dampen doWn poss1ble inflationary
pressures. '

I defy anyone to point to another Con-
greSs of comparable aChievement, of
more respOnsible attention to both the
large and the small problems of our
times. I could cite other measures
passed, our solid record of accomplish-
merit in appropriations to suppOrt our
programs for instanCe. But enough has
been said to point up the range and
depth of our work.

Only the ﬁrst\Congress of President

Indeed, this has been a conservative

have sought to keep the American dream

But each time I hear these siren Words,
thesex soothing syllables,- these invita-
_ tions to apathy, I recall the Words of t
great hiStorian Macaulay, published in
that troubled year of 1848. He wrote:

It is in some sense unreasonable and un-
grateful in us to be constantly discontented
with a situation that is constantly improv-
ing. But, in truth, there is chnstant im-
provement precisely because there is con-
stant discontent. If We Were perfectly satis-
ﬁed with the percent, we Would cease to
continue, to labor, and to save with a view

tent. Exactly. So that while I am prbud

and while you are proud of how miJch We-

have accomplished, never let us forget

that there is so much more to be under-
change that trend, and let me say‘-‘—I WelW- 5

taken One Congress cannot do it all.
There is not enoUgh time. Much de-
pends upon continued revising of ﬁrst
andsecond and later efforts. Only ses-
siori after session of Congress—a discOn-
tented Congress, discontented because
we have done so much and there is so
much morelto dO—only such a Congress
is. capable in this 6th decade of the
20th century of giving America dynamic,
successful government.

Therefore, let us not look back in self-
satisfaction, let us“ not look ahead with
despair. There is challenge in all we
have done, challenge in what there is
to do. ‘

What are some of the things still to be

-‘ 5dOne? Many are obvious.

We must remove the artiﬁcial bar rie1s
that prevent Negroes and other minori-
ties from seeking and obtaining the best
housing they'can afford. 'We must rid
‘our jury System of the evil of racial dis-
crimination. 'We must piotect civil
rights workers from locally permitted
violence. .'

We have done much for the District of
Columbia. But home rule still eludes

We must act and act soon to give

In
Baltimore, the President showed us his
thinking—5a proposed increase of at least
10 percent with proportionately larger
increases for those receiving the smaller
payment, and a guarantee that every
Worker who has participated in the social
security prOgram for 25 years would re-
ceive a minimum monthly beneﬁt of $100.

In addition, the President also suggested

liberalizing the annual income ceiling
affecting secial security beneﬁciaries.

The Current annual maximum is $1, 500. _
Now, with all the fervor of new reli~

We must exert ourselves to bring into.

farmworkers and eradicate the decades
of neglect.

As a growing and dynamic Cong1ess,
we recognize that from time to time, im-
provements can be made in our proce-
dures._ We are not a static Congress.
Therefore, next year I look‘ forward to
considering the recommendations of the
Joint Committee on the Organization of

' Congress. It may be that some of these

proposals we can all agree upon and
adopt; on other proposals, there ma
well: be much debate. But whatever the
eventuality, the fact'that we established
the committee and will consider its re-
port conclusively demonstiates the con-
gressional determination to meet fully
our responsibilities ‘

There are many more Challenges Fu—.
ture Congresses, if they care as much as
this Congress, if they Work as haid as
this Congress, will meet them all. Much
depends upon the upcoming elections.

-I urge all who recognize the achiever-

‘ ments of this Congress, who see the vital

concern with which we have met our
responsibilities, who know what suiely
will be the 1esult of a Congress less at-
tuned to the urgencies of this Nation’s

challenges, I urge each and every one to

go forth acroSs this land, and tell our

story. Tell it in the city and the hamlet,

tell it in the suburb and on the farm.
Tell it and describe the Challenge. Call
on the people. Let them see the chal-
lenge. 5

And they will respond. They will con-
tinue the mandate of 1964. In this I
am conﬁdent because I agree with Abra-
ham Lincoln who said in his ﬁrst
inaugural:

Why should there not be a patient confi-
dence in the ultimate justice of the people?

Is there any better or equal hope in the
World?

primates, rabbits, hampsters

speak for them, to escape the tortures of those who
collect'and keep such life'for the; laboratory experiemen-

tors.

People who have compassiOn for-animals have long‘
battled for legislation to protect laboratory animals from

"unnecessary cruelty. Just this month they scored their

first' major victory. The Senate Commerce Committee has
approved a bill to requirerhumane care and housing of
animals inside laboratories as well as in dealer’s premises

' and in transit.

“lire Bill, 8.2322, introduced-by Senators Magnuson,

' Clark, and Brewster, including an amendment by Senator ’

Monroney, greatly. strenghtens the House-passed version
of the Poage Bill, H. R. 13881. whose number it now takes.
' The measure will place animals used in experimina-

[ tion under the protectionlof the Secretary of Agriculture.

He will set humane standards With reSpect to housing,
feeding, Watering, sanitation,- ventilation, separation by
species and veterinary care. -, ’ \

Among other protections included in the Bill is a re-‘
quirem’ent that :dogs and cats sold by dealers to labora-
tories must'be marked or identified in a humane manner, .

and records must be kept by ,dealers. and research ficili-

ties sothat theft of these animals forplaboratory use will
be‘virtually impossible. . . ‘ ' . , '

The second raid in less than two

. weeks by Maryland state police who;

uncovered another “Dachau concen~~

tratien "camp for dogs” affords dra“ -

matic ‘ammimition ‘fOr the campaign

for compassion about to be resumed

in Congress.
Champions of humane treatment

‘ for animals claim that the clandestine”
‘ traffic in‘ dogs and cats doomed to};
laboratory use has developed into a?

lucrative $50 million a-year business '
They are pushing for government reg-

ulation of this traffic as an avenue

. to stamping out pointless cruelty.

A century ago, Henry Bergh, foun-“

der of the American Soc1ety for Pre-

vention of Cruelty to Animals launch- '

ed a crusade against the alleged cal-
lousness of medical researchers in ex-
perimenting on the live bodies of
vertebrate animals. Attainment of:
Bergh’s goal in legislation imposing

’ humane restraints on animal experi- '

' mentation appears within closer

. reach today than at any time in the --

past.

to be taken up again during the pres-
ent sesSion of Congress.

that aniinals used in research be
spared pain, injury and “other dis-
tresses” unless their suffering is ab-
* _‘ solutely necessary for the alleviatiOn
of human ills. ’

A House Agriculture subcommittee
is considering bills to regulate condi-

tions underwhich animals are han‘
dled and transported in\the labora—.,

to1y-supply market. The latter bills

also contain provisions to combat the

1 stealing of animal pets to supply the
laboratory market.

A score of members of Congresst

haVe introduced measures along these?

urhs on Erue

lines, with support centering chiefly
on a laboratory- -regulating bill spon- .
sored by Rep. Paul G. Rogers (D-Fla.) .1
and an anti-pet stealing, dealer-regu- j.

. lating bill sponsored by Rep. Joseph 3

Y. Resnick (D-N. Y”) Chairman War- :
ren Magnuson of the Senate Com-f
merce Committee is one of half a:

dozen senators who have introduced ;

bills in the upper house for humane 1
treatment 'of research animals.’

Growth of congressional. and pub-ff;
lic support for the relatively moder-
ate measure now proposed contrasts .:

" sharply with the disdain that used to .1

greet the more extreme anti-vivisec- i,
tionist bills put forward in the past. *

Proponents of bills like the Rogers
and Resnick measures disclaim any»?
desire to hamper medical research;
the sole objective, they say, is to pre- 3‘
vent needless suffering. '

To back up the case for legislation,
the animal protectionists societies as— ,
sert their investigations have revealed ?
widespread neglect of animals suffer- :
ing both in the channels of animal

~ The recent-Maryland raids add sub- ,
stance to their claims that dogs are
packed into filthy kennels and trans

ports without food or water, or “stor- .»
A House Commerce subcommittee .
is considering measures to require;

.' awaiting transfer to the laboratory f

table. Cruelties inflicted on non- -anes- "‘
thetized creatures are cited in grim .1
detail.

On the other side of the coin,lsci- -

entists deny charges of callousness to
animal suffering and insist that pain ‘
is inflicted only when necessary to' -,
' advance medical (and veterinary) sci-
ence. ‘ *

AlmOSt universally, they regard the
pending bills as a threat to freedom “ ’
of research and are fearful that mul- ‘
titudinous regulations eventually. V;
would stifle most of the activity in ,7;

passed by the House, would

, The Secretary of Agriculture

. Wouldﬁissue the licenses to ani-

purchase and transportation- of

Under the proposal. esearch
labs could not buy animals from

have been introduced to control
these practices and to set-stan-

on the dealer’s premises, ‘/ in

Unfortunately, a new bill has
been introduced by Sen.‘ Lister
Hill, chairman of the Senate La-
bor and Public :Welfare Commit-
tee, which would make a farce
out of the whole‘matter of ade-
quate ‘ supervision. ' The 'Lister
Bill would set up «an accredit-

ies. This organization would be
“American Association" for Ac-

The sponsors of the‘AAALAC

stated in the brochure of this or-

ladies in Roosevelt who manage,
on small incomes, to take care
of several cats and kittens that
more thoughtless people have sent
out into the world to fend for
themselves have appealed for lov-

The plight of these innocentani- 1'

we are breeding about 35,000,000
puppies. and 50,000,000 kittens
every year.
55,000,000 families in the U. S.
But there are at least 90,000,000
dogs and cats. And puppies and
kittens are being born at the rate
of nearly a quarter-million aday,
10,000 an hour, 165 a minute. It

puppies born are more or less

promptly killed or dumped some- 4

where to die.‘ The lucky ones die
fast and humanely. The unluclq
ones are denied homes but “per-

The battle has now been con-
fused by a counter-bill recently 3
introduced by Senator Lister 11111 . '
and called the National-In- .
stitutes-of-llealth bill. This bill
would exempt laboratories from
mandatory compliance with the I
humane-treatment bills and 1n-
stall, instead,aself-policing sys- ‘
tem. Many humane groups are
seriously concerned about this
because they point out that the
accreditation feature of the Lister
bill involves many staff members
of institutions “which have animal
facilities which are themselves in

'. grave need of improvements,” as
1, Madeleine Bemelmans, president
of the Society for Aniamal Pro- ,
1 tective Legislation puts it.
“There is only one way to get
"’ the dogs out of the cramped cages 1 -
this year,” Mrs. Bemelmans ‘
writes. “That is to fight for all
the' protection possible now for
. experimental animals in the
‘ Senate Commerce Committee r

The differences in the House

are such that members of the -'

‘. animals they buy and who

Sen. Maurein Neuberger,'D-
0re., who supported the bill,
predicted “nothing but trou-
ble” in trying to enforce it, if
enacted, because of the “as-
sumption of the (Senate Com-
merce) committee that animal.
care can be separated from.
animal experimentation. ”

In some laboratories, she
said, “these animals enter ex-
perimentation as soon as they
arrive in the research fac111ty ,-

w: and therefore would be outside

the regulating authority of the
secretary (of agriculture), if
the research facilities so de-
termine. ” .

Sen. A. S. “Mike” Monroney,
who wrote much of .

investigation procedures,
stressed that it is not .“aniiv
vivisectionist” legislation, and
that the researcher would re»
main free to dissect, .“de-
bark,” and discmbowel an ani-
mal to his heart’s content, so
long as it was properly fed
and penned before and after.

The Senate bill does hOW-

and the name of its previous,

Which an inspector can order
an animal to be destroyed if it .
is suffering in the laboratory
from injuries Sustained as a
result of a violation of the p10
posed law. . ,

Ironically, many of the 2,000
research facilities Which would
be affected by “this legislation

"perform. their ,experiments with
‘ the aid of loans and grants

from agencies of ‘ the federal
government. 'While both; bills‘
would seek to clean the gov-
ern'ment’s hands of abetting

animal abuses, the House bill

Specifically would allow the
secretary 0f agri'chlture to cut.

, off. federal funds assisting any
laboratory in violation.’ ' -r -
‘Both bills contain stiff penal-
ties for dealers found guilty of

violations. The House bill
Would levy a fine of $500 per»
offense per day.- The Senate,

’bill provides maximum sen-

tences of a year in prison and.

a $1, 000 fine.

Research laboratories would
face little or no punishment, -
however, but would be subject ,
to “cease and desist” orders
under both bills.

These proviSions are aimed all

~ .In addition, 1 the bill would pro~

ards in the handlingland trans-i

. But research institutions are

A drive is being waged by ani-

' But Mrs. Christine SteVens, s‘ec-
retary of the Society for Animal
Protective Legislation, .says the
aim is not to discourage or ham-
string responsible research on
animals, but merely to give them
a few humane guidelines.

She said the standards would
be carefully set by the Secretary
of Agriculture. . ’ '

For Researchers, Too

“If the animal dealers are go-
ing to be governed by humane
regulations, we can see no reason
why the research institutions
shouldn’t be regulated, too,” she
declared. {‘The, ublic wants it

Mrs. Stevens says- the recent

found dead or in a dying condi-

pliance with the measu1e p10-
vide criminal penalties for vio-
lation of the act by dealeis, and

cilities. The measure would require all
animal dealers to be licensed by the Agri-
culture Department. The criminal penalty

Dear Christine,

In reference to your letter of Anril 25,
the animal facilities at the University of Colorado Medical
Center have been improved but are still lacking.

However, a new animal care facility has
been designed with the aid of consultants from the National
Institutes of Health and the School of Veterinary Medicine at
Colorado State University, and is scheduled to be finished by
about JUne 1967. This is part of the $7.3 million remodeling
program at the medical school.

By EARL AKIN

For more years 1than I can
conceive people have fallen into
two large groups—those who have
pets and those who do not

In the group With ibets we
have a Wide spectrum of love
and devotion On one pend ‘with

sickening displays bordering on:

On the.

cold btit sincere) salmander does not mean thati

complete msamty, and
other witha
understanding of man and am
mat-+1151 some reason I See the
late Gary Cooper and his horse
as being typical of the under-
standing type ' '

-mw

to was

 

 

 

roups

In that large group that does
not have pets; we' have all kinds
of people—Some are good pee-
ple, but they just don’t like an

_, animal around the place. With!
this type of person, the only

thing to do is not to force an
animal on him for any reason.
He has a” perfect right to not
Want animals about, and just
because you are” in love With a

he Will understand, care, or wish:
to hear about it. . 1

But in this large petless group,’
there are bad people who prey;
on the rest. This is not tdo Well

' understood, but instances of such

behavior have gone on here in
Berkeley. - *
Let’s take a case in point A1
pet was lOst from a home. That
same afternoon, the telephone
rang and .- the. caller asked" if: a“
pet had been lost.’ Being told yes '
With ‘Consjiderable "cance’rh, ‘i’fhe
caller then asked if there was a
reward. There was! "FaISt. "
‘No threats. No blackmail;- Just
a sweet innocent question The‘
caller was a teenager." ‘ '

Some things that pass for
human actually steal animals off
of the street and sell them for‘
medical research. 1 am not q'ués-ﬂ
tioning the heed for. the animals.
I am told that they are absolutely
necessary for medical research.
But I do‘ object to the low and
cowardly way the animals areob-
tained In my humble opinion, ;
this problem will have to be 1
studied at the national level. The 7
wide spread net work is almost
unbelievable. - ' . . ., .'

It seems to me' that the lesson
is clear. Don’t let your pet run
wild. This is a city, not the wide
open Spaces of the country Use

your head. Man is the only-jani-

mal that can think, and "if there
is anything to ' man‘ at all, :dhé'
must think for the other animals '
..too If killing is necessary, then
kill without pain; if research is
necessary on animals, then let
it be conducted under sound in
telllgent management that has _
some simple Compassion in iti’: ,
It is sad to write. of such things, ‘1'
but manythings inlife' are sad.
They don’t go away if we refuse
to see them. We must deal with?
them for what they are, and as
l-ong as decency is ‘still- aer
“man will prevail" for the ngd
‘of the other animaIsQI sihoerély

Dear Sir,

It was most encouraging to read your editorial, "Animal
Protection Legislation”, which appearod in the January 18,
l§66, issue of Tho Telegraph-

Congressman W. R. ?oage, Chairman of tho Livestook Sub-
committoo of the Houoo Committee on ﬁghioulturo, hmo scheduled
hearings March 7 and 8 on twolvo bills, including his own,
H.K. 12488. The Poago bill woulo liconoo onlmal dealers,

sot humane standards for core of all spooios of animals on
doalors‘ promises and in laboratories, remove federal funds
from laborotorioo if ihey fail to comply, and pr ovido for
revocation of dealers' lioonsoo if they are found guilty of
ourolty or theft.
We hope the Gongyooo will act promptly and favorably on this
bill, which would eliminate vast amounts of nooﬁloso suffering.
Your help in obtaining onactmont of thio measure will be

d ooply appreciated.

Thank you for the excellent statement you have made.

Kﬁrnlals TKF'Besearch

”Should "aft reference to re-
searrch facilities” be eliminated from
pending legislation to require humane
treatment of animals in dealers'
premises and laboratories and prevent
theft ot'dogs and cats? This is what
pr. Maurice B. Visscher asked 'for in
the Associated Press story you carried
after the congressional hearings.
March 7, on over twenty bills on the
subject.

Dr. Visscher, a consistent opponent
oi every bill ever introduced to require
decent treatment of animals in labora-
tOries, evidently“ doesn’t want to
change the status quo at the University
of Minnesota Medical School, where he
is professor of physiology. As he has
stated in other press interviews, the
university uses between 7,000 and 10,-
000 dogs per year,- and about 1, 400 are
caged right now, as shown in a pam-
phlet with pictures of the dogs taken
in January of this year at the uni
versityu

Dr. Visscher, deseribed in your
article as “a spokesman for 1,200
medical research organizations," ex-
empliﬁes the need for regulation to
prevent needless cruelty to animals in
laboratories. S. 2322 and S. 3059 would
empower the Secretary, of Agriculture
to set humane standards for careand
. handling of animals in laboratories, in
transit, and in dealers’ premises and
require identiﬁcation of dogs and cats
to prevent theft. The bills speciﬁcally
exempt any control over experimenta-
tion” itself so that under no circum-
Stances could they possibly hamper
eSearch. 0n the contrary, the legisla-
tion would greatly improve research
‘wherever the treatment of animals' is
now such as to lead to needless suffer-
ing and death. Testimony» before the
com'mittee,'shows that 30 per cent to
50 percent of animals purchased from
dealers die in the laboratories before
they are even used for experimenta
tion. . J‘ 1 " ‘Ohristine Stevens,

tective Legislation. ,

Dear Mrs. Stevens,

Sorry I couldn't get to your blast last week but something '
unexpected came up, in the form of the Pennsylvania Railroad 5

anyhow; wish I could have come.

I found the enclosed in my files and thought you might like

She said the measures now un-

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES-:-

Friday, October 2I,”1966

Mr. MCCORMACK Mr Speaker just

a year, ago It. stood in the Well of the:-
House and commended the 1st session or
the 89th Congress as the Congress of _ful-g
ﬁllment, of accomplished hopes and re-
alized dreams . 2' 2:

session was not the \peak of our effort,
' not the pinnacle; or our achieVement.
The 2d se's‘siOh has not been marked by
the great breakthroughs that _so, distin-'
guished the ﬁrst: it could not be so be-
cause so many of the enactments of 1965
were of proposals and programs Which

had been under consideration for a hum-2

' In 1965 their tithe had come. ,

. of President LyndOn seine-3 Johnson and
'with the cooperatiOn of_ a membership
more closely attuned to the will of the

people than any other Congress in ‘re,-‘

'cent years, we loosed the long pent-up

an urban setting, we enacted a bill to

billboards and junkyards and with our
lag in recreational areas. -2 '3'

The 13t session of the 89th Congress
did muCh more. So much more in fact
that on October 7, 1965, the President
was prepared to say: 2

* ,COngress the greatest in history.
your committees and bOth your houses have,
come the greatest outgrowing of creative
legislation in the history of this nation . . .
LazThié has been the fabulous 89th Congress.

a breather” during the second session
might rest on its laurels.

On the contrary, it has been a produc-
tive Congress, responsibly engaged in.
fortifying the legislation passed last year
and preVious years, improving and add-

,ing to enacted programs, and carrying

out one of its least celebrated and least
obtrusive functions—that of overseeing '
the administration and execution of its
legislatiVe enactments. .

Only in this way can Congress con-
tribute to its fullest extent to its responsi-
bilities under the Constitution. Only in
e fully apprised
of the success or failure I its solutions to
the Nation’s problems. a

For we do not consider ourselves in-
fallible. We have not always made the
right choice, not alWays responded to a
problem in the best way.

Because we will make mistakes, how-

, ever, does not deter us from acting. Un-
like Some of our citizens who respond to
any answer with the timidity that para-
rlyzes, who cry “wait, wait, ” when afﬁrma—

tive response is necessary, the majority
in this Congress has analyzed problems,
Searched for solutions, developed reme-
dies. Having prepared well, we have
acted well.

2 And Without hesitation I aii'irm that 1n

.. the great majority of instances we have ;

acted wisely and well; our response has
been addreSSed to the right problem in
the right manner to the right degree.

No, my friends, we have not feared to

j act. And that is why the 2d session of

the 89th Congress has been every bit as

outstanding, has been the scene of as

much achieVement, as the 1st session.
Because the problems We faced were

newer and more 'complex than many of

those on which we legislated in the ﬁrst

session, however, many people who only
, saw the surface suggested that we had
“ turned into a do- -nothing, or at least a do-
, ; little, COngress. .

Unfortunately, even some 3.

Most Of us, however, know that action
and confrontation on the ﬂoor is only the '
