THE ETON COLLEGE
HARE-HUNT.

A Protest and a Memorial.

“ There is no more pitiful, more helpless object than a thoroughly
tired out hare hopping the last ﬁfty yards of her career in front of the
pack. . . . It is not wise for the pursuer too closely to analyse the
feelings of the pursued.”-—Hunting, edited by the Duke of Beaufort,
in the “Badminton Library”.

“. . . Thus the poor Hare
A puny, dastard animal, but vers’d
In subtle wiles, diverts the youthful train.”
WILLIAM SOMERVILE’s The Ohace (1735).

l iTON COLLEGE shares with Ampleforth College the

unenviable distinction of being one of the last of our
Public Schools to retain an organised hare-hunt (with

a pack of beagles) among the recognised pastimes of its
scholars.

It is perhaps not generally remembered that Eton College
boys indulged in even stranger sports of old. Thus Aubrey in
his Remaines 0f Gentilis‘me (1687), says: “About Whitsuntide,
I think on Holy-Thursday, the schoole-boyes doe hunte a Ram,
till they kill him; and then they have a venison feast made of
him; they use to over-heate themselves . . .” Sir H. C. M.
Lyte, the historian of the College, tells us that “sports which
would now be considered reprehensible were tolerated and
even encouraged at Eton . . . No work was done on Shrove
Tuesday after 8 am. and at Eton, as elsewhere on this day,
thepractice prevailed of torturing some live bird . . .” Re-
ferring to the custom of the ram-hunt he says: “ The College
butcher had to provide a ram annually at election-tide, to be
hunted and killed by the scholars,” the unfortunate animal
being ham-strung and beaten to death. Even in the nineteenth

 




 

century, we read, such sports as dog—ﬁghts, badger-baits, bull-
baiting, and cat and duck hunts were “organised for the
special ediﬁcation of the Eton boys.”

The Eton beagles are in reality by no means an ancient
institution, for they were only introduced in 1857 -58. In their
earlier days, as we learn from Brinsley Richards’s Seven Years
at Eton, they were “often made to hunt a miserable trapped
fox which had lost one of its pads”; and an entry in the diary
of the ﬁrst Master records how the Hunt “stoned down” a
weasel from a tree and killed it! Nowadays of course more
modern methods are in vogue.

The disappearance of these quaint Old English pastimesas
a result of a more enlightened public opinion culminating in
the various laws for the Protection of Animals, together with
the growing disfavour with which blood-sports for children
are viewed in educational circles, are obvious sign-posts for
the future.

These and other symptoms of changed feeling are good
omens for the fulﬁlment of the prediction made a generation
ago by that tireless opponent of the Eton College Hunt, H. S.
Salt: “It is evident that the example set by Dr. Arnold in
abolishing the Beagles at Rugby will have to be followed,
sooner or later, at Eton itself.”—

To-day, when the multiplicity of other games is almost
bewildering, there is less excuse than ever for the retention of
blood—sports at schools. Nevertheless it is still frequently
objected in their defence that the boys “must have games.”
To this, however, the yet more popular phrase, “It is not
cricket” is surely a sufﬁcient reply—even though beagling
does take place during the football season.

Despite considerable pressure and public controversy dur-
ing the present century, successive Eton Headmasters have
refused‘to suppress the College hare—hunt, sometimes for reasons
which seem almost comically inadequate.

The appointment of a new Headmaster (Mr. C. A. Elliott,
MA.) in 1933, led the Society to send him an appeal to
bring the College into line with the growing humanitarian

spirit of the day by abolishing the. sport of beagling there.
After pointing out that the Society’s chief object was the
edcuation of public opinion towards more humane views on
the rights Of wild animals, the letter continued :—

“ But progress is necessarily slow and Obstructed so
long as so cruel a sport as the hunting and ‘ breaking-up.’
of hares is actually permitted and encouraged at a great
school such as Eton. This is the more regrettable since the
practice Of a drag-hunt is quite possible and Was, in fact,
once successfully used there. . . . On behalf Of the Society
the Council therefore respectfully appeals to you to give
this matter the consideration it deserves and, if possible,
put an end to the custom of beagling at Eton College.”

Early in‘1934 a further appeal was made, this time in the
form of a memorial addressed to the Eton Authorities with the
following covering letter :~——

To the Chairman and Members of the Governing Body,

Eton College, Eton.
February 8th, 1934.

DEAR SIRS,

At the request of the Council I am enclosing a copy of
a memorial drawing your attention to the Eton College Hare—
hunt.

The Council desires respectfully to point out that this
memorial—note has been signed by people of all types, particu—
larly educationists, scientists, authors, and divines, and trusts
that you will be able to regard it as an indication of the
growing and widespread public feeling against the sport of
hare—hunting at schools.

In view of the fact that the signatories’ names are spread
over a great number Of separate sheets (now ﬁled at this
Ofﬁce) we have typed them as appended for your Convenience.

With compliments,
Yours faithfully,

BERTRAM LLOYD,
Hon. Secretary.
NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE ABOLITION OF CRUEL SPORTS,
4 TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON.

 




 

The memorial was widely circulated for signature and
was signed by well over 50 per cent. of the recipients. In
View of its terms it is but natural that the names of many
Headmasters and educationists are lacking; but from letters
received at the Society’s ofﬁce and from other indications it is
clear that many more would have signed had they not been
precluded by reasons of etiquette. Apart from the teaching
profession, moreover, many of those who did not sign were
only restrained by purely personal motives and not by any
sympathy with the Eton Beagles as an institution. On the
other hand, some of those who objected to the terms of the
memorial gave reasons so curious as to be worth recording.
A famous scientist, for instance, preferred not to sign because
he felt that trapping was responsible for more suffering than
hunting; a well-known writer objected because he regarded
hunting as less cruel than shooting; and another refused be-
cause in his opinion town—dwellers, in their ignorance of the
facts, take an exaggerated View of the cruelties of blood-sports.

Even Lord Tavistock, however, who has spent much time
in seeking to prove the impossibility of “humane” shooting of
foxes, forest deer, etc., went so far as to admit “that in this
case the Society is probably right,” though he naturally found
himself unable to sign the protest without very important
qualiﬁcations. He has courteously permitted the Society to
quote his view.

Many famous people now dead have signed former pro-
tests against this Hunt, among them Thomas Hardy, Herbert
Spencer, Alfred Russel Wallace and John Morley. The remark-
able list of signatories of the memorial here printed contains
representative names in many different professions including
educationists, divines, statesmen and administrators, scientists,
psychologists, artists, poets and novelists.

. The memorial was duly acknowledged by the Provost who
informed the Society that the attention of the College would
be called to it in due course.

 




THE MEMORIAL.

To the Chairman and Governing Body of Eton College.

DEAR SIRS,
The Council Of the National Society for the Abolition Of
Cruel Sports and the undersigned beg to draw the attention of
the Governing Body Of Eton College to the many protests

made against the institution known as the Eton College
Beagles. '

We desire to express our conviction that it cannot be other
than demoralising for school-boys to be encouraged to seek
‘ amusement in the inﬂiction of pain on animals, and that the
l permission granted at Eton College to indulge in hare-hunting
i when various other more humane outdoor games are available
: is greatly to be deplored.

l
K

At a time when a new national conscience has arisen in
relation to the treatment of animals, and when there is a
‘ marked tendency amongst teachers to inculcate a more sym-
} pathetic regard for wild life, the fact that a great public
school should continue to countenance a practice as foolish as
it is cruel seems particularly regrettable.

We therefore venture to suggest that Eton College should
no longer stand aloof from this humane spirit; and we respect-
fully appeal tO the Governing Body to put an end to ofﬁcially
sanctioned hare-hunting at Eton College.
