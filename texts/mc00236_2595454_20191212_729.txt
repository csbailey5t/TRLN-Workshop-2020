In June, amid the golden ﬁelds,

I saw a groundhog lying dead.

Dead lay he; my senses shook,

And mind outshot our naked frailty.
There lowly in the vigorous summer
His form began its senseless change, "
And made my senses waver dim
Seeing nature ferocious in him.
InSpecting close his maggots’ might
And seething cauldron of his being,
Half with loathing, half with a strange love,
I poked him with an angry stick.
The fever arose, became a ﬂame

And Vigour circumscribed the skies,
Immense energy in the sun,

And through my frame a sunless trembling.
My stick had done nor good nor harm.
Then stood I silent in the day
Watching the object, as before;

And kept my reverence for knowledge
Trying for control, to be still,

To quell the passion of the blood;
Until I had bent down on my knees
Praying for joy in the sight of decay.
And so I left; and I returned

In Autumn strict of eye, to see

The sap gone out of the groundhog,
But the bony sodden hulk remained.
But the year had lost its meaning,
And in intellectual chains

I lost both love and loathing,

Mured up in the wall of wisdom.
Another summer took the ﬁelds again
Massive and burning, full of life,

But when I chanced upon the Spot
There was only a little hair left,

And bones bleaching in the sunlight
Beautiful as architecture;

I watched them like a geometer,

And cut a walking stick from a birch.
It has been three years, now.

There is no sign of the groundhog.

I stood there in the whirling summer,
My hand capped a withered heart,
And thought of China and of Greece,
Of Alexander in his ten -

Of Montaigne in his tower,

Of Saint Theresa in her wild lament.

The Attraction of Housecats

I can hear the cat coming

from the moment her paws

begin to pad softly down the bare
wooden steps from the third floor.

~She leaps to the windowsill
without so much as a glance
in my direction, yawns once,
and curls up in a lazy
gold patch of sunlight
floating through the window.

An hour passes, the two of us

companions in silence.

When I look next, the cat is looking
back at me with half—closed eyes.

She stirs, stretches, approaches,
nuzzles my palm with her nose,

and sits back on her haunches
collecting affection

as if it were due without question,
the ears raised, the chest puffed out,
the forepaws placed just so.

A subtle shift

of posture, and then that
penetrating gaze, always unexpected,
the dark slits of the pupils,

for an instant, flaring,

intensity so pure and startling

one can almost feel a coldness
crossing the heart like a cloud.

Then in the twitch of a whisker,
the head cocks slightly;

the tail swishes the air

with animal grace,

and the cat turns,
and is gone.

THE MOUNTAIN AND THE SQUIRREL

 

The mountain and the squirrel

Had a quarrel,

And the former called the latter “Little prig;”
Bun replied,

“You are doubtless very big;

But all sorts of things and weather
Must be taken in together

To make up a year,

And a Sphere.

And I think it no disgrace

To occupy my place.

If I’m not so large as you,

You are not so small as I,

And not half so Spry.

I’ll not deny you make

A very pretty squirrel track.

Talents differ; all is well and wisely put;
If I cannot carry forests on my back,
Neither can you crack a nut!”

FOR I WILL CONSIDER MY BIRD ARIEL

For

she likes what she sees in the mirror
she keeps her thousands of feathers in fine
she knows that joy is a bath in a pie plate

her breath smells of seeds

her optic nerve hums with glory

she rolls her r's at shapes I cannot see

when the wild birds migrate, she jitters on the windowsill
pumps her throat in triple time for freedom

she turns her head upside down at my touch, shuddering
tenderness against all instinct to fly

she restores my belief in softness
when I dance, she fans her yellow wings

when I weep, she presses millet in my ears

ALIENATION: TWO BEES

I came upon them in the cabin—
the angry one at the window
and the old bent one on the bed
the one at the window buzzing & buzzing
beating its wings on the window

heating the pane
the one on the bed

the silent one with the bent frame

alone on the counterpane
I didn’t mean to kill them

but the one in the window
wouldn’t be waved

back to his hive

The door was Open and he knew it
and ﬂew in it for a moment

and then ﬂew back

away from his community
Something had alienated him

and he would not go back
or was it perhaps
the wounded one on the bed
who kept him
I tried to get him to fasten onto
a crumpled page
of the local news
but he would not
And I must have hurt him doing that
for he fell on the bed

and died in an instant
stretching out his legs

or arms

 

as if to his comrade or lover

The Seed-Eaters

The seed-eaters, the vegetarian birds,

Redpolls, grosbeaks, crossbills, ﬁnches, siskins,
Fly south to winter in our north, so making
A sort of Florida 01 our best blizzards.

Weed seeds and seeds 0[ pine cones are their pillage,
Alder and birch eatkins, such vegetable

Odds and ends as the winged keys of maple

As well as roadside sumac, red-plush-seeded.

Ilil with a bounce in snowﬂake [locks come juncos
As if a hand had llipped them and tree sparrows,
New nip and tuck and playing tag, now squatting
All weather-prooled and feather-[lulled on snow.

llard Iare, lull least, 1’“ say, deep cold, high spirits.
llere’s Christmas to Candlemas on a bunting’s budget.
From this old seed-eater with his beans, his soybeans,
Cracked corn, cracked wheat, peanuts and split peas, hail!

I think before they saw me the giraffes

Were watching me. Over the golden grass,

The bush and ragged open tree of thorn,

From a grotesque height, under their lightish horns,
Their eyes were ﬁxed on mine as I approached them.
The hills behind descended steeply: iron

Coloured outcroppings of rock half covered by

Dull green and sepia vegetation, dry

And sunlit: and above, the piercing blue

Where clouds like islands lay or like swans ﬂew.

 

Seen from those hills the scrubby plain is like

A large-scale map whose features have a look
Half menacing, half familiar, and across

Its brightness arms of shadow ceaselessly
Revolve. Like small forked twigs or insects move
Giraffes, upon the great map where they live.

When I went nearer, their long bovine tails
Flicked loosely, and deliberately they turned,
An undulation of dappled grey and brown,
And stood in proﬁle with those curious planes
Of neck and sloping haunches. Just as when
Quite motionless they watched I never thought
Them moved by fear, a desire to be a tree,

So as they put more ground between us I
Saw evidence that these were animals with
Perhaps no wish for intercourse, or no

And cold and dark now bring the image of
Those creatures walking without pain or love.

 

 

 

The Petty Qﬁieers’ Mess

Just now I visited the monkeys: they

Are captive near the mess. And so the day

Ends simply with a sudden darkness, while

Again across the palm trees, like a ﬁle,
The rain swings from the bay.

The radio speaks, the lights attract the ﬂies,

Above them and the rain our voices rise,

And somewhere from this hot and trivial place

As the news tells of death, with pleasant face,
Comes that which is not lies.

The voices argue: Soldiers in the end
Turn scarecrows; their ambiguous ﬁgures blend
With all who are obsessed by food and peace.
The rulers go, they cannot order these

Who are not disciplined.

0 cars with abdicating princes: streets

Of untidy crowds: 0 terrible defeats!

Such images which haunt us of the past

Flash on the present like the exile’s vast
Shivers and ﬂeshy heats;

Winter is more than lacunae and loss; in The Winter House,
Robert Gibb transforms the season of stillness into a world whose
stark beauties and sometimes frightening encounters provide
the substance for song. The most elemental of seasons evokes
his praise, and praise makes winter into a time of movement
toward beginnings—not simply a cold, still end. Filled with
structures and artifacts and transfigured objects, this book is a
book about making, about ordering the inner landscape as well
as the external one. With their careful music and clear-cut im-
ages, the poems of The Winter House manage to celebrate a set-
ting that is both natural and human, isolated and figured with
remarkable shapes. .

Robert Gibb is currently Writer-in-Residence at Cedar Crest
College in Allentown, Pennsylvania. His poems have appeared
in Missouri Review, Chowder Review, Sou’wester, and numerous
other journals.

(Ac/a
At the Center of the Blind _ _

I am moving out inside
The first full storm

Of the season, snow
Falling forever in its idle
Medium-ﬂaked way—

My camera’s long lens

Cold as a tube of freon,

My shoulders a mantle

Of the whitest fur

As I trudge through the stiff,
Cracking undergrowth

Of the woods’ enormous rooms

And come upon the blind:
Twenty feet up

In a cluster of trees

Where hunters hid suspended
Above the snow-

Speckled backs of prey.

I climb into it, hunkered
Down, camera on my knees,
And look up to where I hope
The hawk will be, suddenly

In all its silent grace.

More and more I see

How the woods are not there,
How my own limbs and camera
Are points of scattered darkness
In a continuous ﬁeld of white

56

 

 

Floating in the halfway

'Heaven of tree trunks

The world grows so round

There’s no horizon,

Silence is all of one sound
Before the trees abruptly
Reverberate into threes,
Echoes bouncing off them.

A steadily rising clamor

Begins crashing through the woods,
The air filled with crows

Beating their iron-eyed anger

' In a living furnace of wings,

Malevolence of beaks, brains
Coiled like piles of entrails.

I fear for my eyes

Hanging there

At the center of the blind,
And hide them far as possible
Behind my shots.

Everywhere I look my shutter
Stops the movement of crows.
Black regains the world.

I follow them as they rise

At the constant edge of focus—
Snow falling down my lens
Like stars through the corridors
In the cawing tops of trees.

Oppossum

Rat’s tail. Rat’s ears.

The tiny human hands,
Change-purse of a womb.
Is covered

With the kind of fur
Attics grow in trunks.
Plays dead as deception,
Possum for real.

Falcon

Hooded against pity

On the fluttering sleeve
Of the world, the garland
Any treeline becomes.
Implaccable

In the long pull of the body,

The dream folded
About it like wings,
The sky about the head
Spilling like water —
Eddy of the eye

The world rises into
Like reflection, drift,
Dark, possible prey.

All that awesomeness

And no true opposing thumb.

sense that you could disinvite the dis-
ease, while this was so total; or would
be, Max said. But the main thing, said
Greg, was to see that he didn’t go the
macrobiotic route, which might be
harmless for plump Betsy but could
only be devastating for him, lean as
he’d always been, with all the ciga-
rettes and other appetite-suppressing
chemicals he’d been welcoming into
his body for years; and now was hardly
the time, as Stephen pointed out, to be
worried about cleaning up his act, and
eliminating the chemical additives and
other pollutants that we’re all blithely
or not so blithely feasting on, blithely
since we’re healthy, healthy as we
can be; so far, Ira said. Meat and po-
tatoes is what I’d be happy to see him
eating, Ursula said wistfully. And spa-
ghetti and clam sauce, Greg added.
And thick cholesterol-rich omelettes
with smoked mozzarella, suggested
Yvonne, who had ﬂown from London
for the weekend to see him. Chocolate
cake, said Frank. Maybe not chocolate
cake, Ursula said, he’s already eating
so much chocolate.

ND when, not right away but still
only three weeks later, he was
accepted into the protocol for the new
drug, which took considerable behind-
the-scenes lobbying with the doctors,
he talked less about being ill, accord—
ing to Donny, which seemed like a
good sign, Kate felt, a sign that he
was not feeling like a victim, feeling
not that he had a disease but, rather,
was living with a disease (that was the
right cliché, wasn’t it?), a more hospi-
table arrangement, said Jan, a kind of
cohabitation which implied that it was
something temporary, that it could be
terminated, but terminated how, said
Hilda, and when you say hospitable,
Jan, I hear hospital. And it was en-
couraging, Stephen insisted, that from
the start, at least from the time he was
ﬁnally persuaded to make the tele-
phone call to his doctor, he was will-
ing to say the name of the disease,
pronounce it often and easily, as if it
were just another word, like boy or
gallery or cigarette or money or deal,

as in no big deal, Paolo interjected, 7

because, as Stephen continued, to utter
the name is a sign of health, a sign
that one has accepted being who one
is, mortal, vulnerable, not exempt, not
an exception after all, it’s a sign that
one is willing, truly willing, to ﬁght
for one’s life. And we must say the
name, too, and often, Tanya added,

FOUR DEER

Four deer lift up their lovely heads to me

In the dusk of the golf course I plod across

Toward home. They’re browsing the wet grass

The snow has left and, statued, stare at me

In deep silence and I see whatever light there is

Gather to glossy pools in their eight mild,

Barely curious but wary eyes. When one at a time

They bend again to feed, I can hear the crisp

Moist crunch of the surviving grass between

Their teeth, imagine the slow lick of a tongue

Over whickering lips. They’ve come from the unlit
Winter corners of their fright to ﬁnd

A fresh season, this early gift, and stand

Almost easy at the edge of white snow islands

And lap the gray-green sweet depleted grass. About them
Hangs an air of such domestic sense, the comfortable
Hush of folk at home with one another, a familiar
Something I sense in spite of the great gulf of strangeness
We must look over at each other. Tails ﬂicker

White in thickening dusk and I feel their relief

At the touch of cold snow underfoot while their faces
Nuzzle grass, as if, like birds, they had crossed
Unspeakable vacant wastes with nothing but hunger
Shaping their brains and driving them from leaf to

Dry leaf, sour strips of bark—under a thunder of guns
And into the cold comfort of early dark. I’ve seen

Their straight despairing lines cloven in snowﬁelds
After storm, an Indian ﬁle of famished natives, poor
Unprayed-for wanderers through blinding chill, seasoned
Castaways in search of home ports, which they’ve found
At last here on the winter’s edge between our houses and
Their trees. All of a sudden, I’ve come too close. Like
Birds they move as one mind, springing in silent waves
Over the grass, then cracking snow with sharp hard
Snaps, lightfooting it into the sanctuary of a pine grove
Where they stand looking back at me, a deer-shaped family
Of shadows against the darker arch of trees and this
Rusting dusk. When silence settles over us again and
They bow down to browse, the sound of grass being lipped, '
Bitten, meets me across the space between us. Close
Enough for comfort, they see we keep, instinctively, our
Distance, sharing this air where a few last shards of day-
Light glitter in little meltpools or spread a skin of
Brightness on the ice, the ice stiffening toward midnight
Under the clean magnesium burn of a ﬁrst star.

we mustn’t lag behind him in honesty,
or let him feel that, the effort of hon-
esty having been made, it’s something
done with and he can go on to other
things. One is so much better prepared

to help him, Wesley replied. In a way

he’s fortunate, said Yvonne, who had
taken care of a problem at the New
York store and was ﬂying back to
London this evening, sure, fortunate,
said Wesley, no one is shunning him,
Yvonne went on, no one’s afraid to
hug him or kiss him lightly on the

because there are side effects it doesn’t
mean he has to get them, or all
of them, each one, or even some
of them. That’s just a list of all the
possible things that could go wrong,
because the doctors have to cover
themselves, so they make up a worst-
case scenario, but isn’t what’s hap-
pening to him, and to so many other
people, Tanya interrupted, a worst-
case scenario, a catastrophe no one
could have imagined, it’s too cruel,
and isn’t everything a side effect,
quipped Ira, even we are all side ef-
fects, but we’re not bad side effects,
Frank said, he likes having his friends
around, and we’re helping each other,
too; because his illness sticks us all in
‘ the same glue, mused Xavier, and,
whatever the jealousies and grievances
from the past that have made us wary
and cranky with each other, when
something like this happens (the sky is
falling, the sky is falling!) you under-
stand what’s really important. I agree,
Chicken Little, he is reported to have
said. But don’t you think, Quentin
observed to Max, that being as close to
him as we are, making time to drop by
the hospital every day, is a way of our
trying to deﬁne ourselves more ﬁrmly
and irrevocably as the well, those who
aren’t ill, who aren’t going to fall ill,
as if what’s happened to him couldn’t
happen to us, when in fact the chances
are that before long one of us will end
up where he is, which is probably what
he felt when he was one of the cohort
visiting Zack in the spring (you never
knew Zack, did you?), and, according
to Clarice, Zack’s widow, he didn’t
come very often, he said he hated hos-
pitals, and didn’t feel he was doing
Zack any good, that Zack would see
on his face how uncomfortable he was.
Oh, he was one ,of those, Aileen said.
A coward. Like me.

ND after he was sent home from
the hospital, and Quentin had
volunteered to move in and was cook-

thought, his appetite was good, and
what he said, Orson reported, was that
he agreed when Stephen advised him
that the main thing was to keep in
shape, he was a ﬁghter, right, he
wouldn’t be who he was if he weren’t,
and was he ready for the big ﬁght,
Stephen asked rhetorically (as Max
told it to Donny), and he said you bet,
and Stephen added it could be a lot
worse, you could have gotten the dis-

scientists are working on it, the Amer-

one bucking for that Nobel Prize a few
years down the road, that all you have

to do is stay healthy for another year
or two and then there will be good

Stephen said, my timing is good. And
