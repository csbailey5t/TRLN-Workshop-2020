Dear Jean,

I was glad to hear that you have a good helper
for the correspondence on revising "Facts About
Furs.

We may be in London in September and will let
you know so we can talk about the work.

I'm very much.occupied at the moment with
legislation which wyuld include the use of analgesic
and tranquilizing drugs as a recognized part of the
"adequate veterinary care" provided for in the
Laboratory Animal Welfare Act. We hope we can get
this provision included by the Subcommittee new con-

sidering the bill. It would be an important forward
step.

Yours,

Christine Stevens
President

Dear Jean,

Yes, please do get secretarial assistance to help
you in getting out the necessary letters for the revision
of "Facts About Furs". I know how much.humane work you
are trying to do, and it would be a shame for you to be
held up for the lack of occasional secretarial help.

Let me know about what you think may be needed and
when, and we will forward a check to you.

Dear Christine,

1 have had a letter from Proiessor

(now Sir William) weipers in Glasgow in which he

says that they have at last got the Wernberg Unit
Working there and adapted in such a way as to make
it possible to make recordings 01 anaesthetia. He
has promised to send me a report when there is one.
I also have COpies oi letters
between Wernberg and Tony Carding, and a coniidential
report by ISPA 01 the apparatus seen in Spain.
at the moment I Just do not ieel

capable 0: coin: more than Wait Ion Weipers'report,
which looks to me some way oii but is likely to be
authoritative in the end. I gather that his lirst
aim is anaesthesia rather than euthanasia. I am
sure that the experimental work needs to be done here
and not in Japan Where it would probably end up
unsatisiactory and cruel.

Sorry about this.

PrOgress with iurs is Very slow.
People don‘t answer letters even when I manage to
gettihem written.

All good WlShGS,

Your S ,

Dear Jean,

Ybur letter to Fuller Industries, Marlpost,
Pondtail Road, Horshwm, Sussex was returned to us
marked "not known". I'm.enclosing the letter in
case you are able to find a current address for theme

The people at the Canadian Association for
Humane Trapping are tremendously pleased with the
fact that you are bringing "Facts about Furs" up to
date; They seem.to be doing.a good job with their
booths at sportsmen's shows and other means of bring-
ing the horrors of trapping to the public.

Same bills now up for consideration in New Jersey
wouldzlake some improvements in the existing state
law by limiting the use of steel traps. They have
passed one house of the legislature and we hope will
become law when the legislature meets again in Septemp
be? 0

Kindest regards,

Dear Christine,

I think you know that we have a really
splendid young woman now working for JAWS in Tokyo,
Ann Ross by name. She has had many years of experience
with laboratory animals besides experience with dog-
taainingaand handling of various other animals. I am
sure you will excuse me it I pass on to you a comment

which she has made. This is with regards to Comfortable

 

ggggtg£§,she writes :" Unfortunately although it has
many ideal kennels and cat cages it also shows some
which are Very cramped and uncomfortable, cats pages

70 and 71 and dogs page 42. If one is going to hand out
booklets to the Japanese one must be sure that the

facilities are perfect in every respect for the animals?

There is no need to acknowledge this
letter, you have much more important things to do.

A FUR INDUSTRY REPORT

ON THE KILLING 0F FUR-MING ANIMA_I._._§_

Much has been said, written and pictured about the cruelty behind the scenes
in bringing various furs to market for their eventual manufacture into
beautiful fur garments. Considerable publicity also has been given to fears
that certain species are headed for extinction.

The fur industry long maintained a discreet silence on the subject. Rather
than offer a blind defense, we put our faith in the efforts of government,
veterinary, conservationist and humane society investigators to ascertain
the true facts.

The findings of these investigators, whose qualifications are
beyond question, tend to answer the bulk of the criticisms that
have been voiced. Their reports also indicate that vociferous
naturalists and conservationists, although unquestionably well-
intentioned, have nevertheless been overzealous and underinformed.

The fur industryerore than any other qrogp, is painfully aware that wanton
destruction of a specie or species can only lead to theLeventual end of our
industry itself. Moreover, we are profoundly aware that the dissemination
of misinformation regarding inhumane treatment of animals can only alienate
a segment of our consuming market.

The industry itself and the livelihoods of thousands of furriers

and many more thousands of workers are at stake in this controversy.
Therefore, we have carefully studied all the available evidence and
have put our faith in the conclusions of investigators of the high-
est authoritv whose researches have been both intensive and
IWQiOugn.

Regarding the harvesting of pelts and the methods used, these investigations
have found that, in all but possibly the most dangerous Species, animals are
dis etched in the,ggickest and most humane manner known today. Although some
of the methods may sound barbaric, veterinarians and humane society_witnesses
have endorsed them, have called them as humane as can be, and have testified
that they are comparable to the methods by which cattle, sheep and hogs

are killed in the civilized nations of the world.

Expert Testimony on the Seal Hunt

In testimony before the Canadian House of Commons, Tom Hughes, general
manager of the Ontario Humane Society, declared it was impossible to skin
seals alive, as has been depicted in widely-circulated films. Mr. Hughes
said, ”The hunting of seal pups by Canadians is as humane as slaughter ever
can be.”

 




-2-

Dr. Forbes McLeon, veterinarian and managing director of the St. John, New
Brunswick, S.P.C.A., who also accompanied a seal hunt, said, ”Over 800
carcasses were examined and less than l0 percent did not have fractured
skulls. No evidence of suffering prior to death could.be observed in the

ID percent without fractured skulls. A crushed skull should be satisfactory
proof of a humane death. No cruel acts in killinq methods were observed.
Sad sights frequently are misconstrued as cruelty.‘I

Farley Mowat, author and naturalist, reported, ”The seal hunt has been entirely
misrepresented. Professional sealers are not bestial and are generally far
more humane than the thousands of amateurs who take to the bush every year

in search of deer. The S.P.C.A. has succeeded in my Opinion in eliminating
any real cruelty in the hunt...”

The Canadian investigation concerned the well-publicized annual
hunt for seal pups in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The animals
involved are harp seals used mainly for leather and tnimming
purposes, with relatively little if any coming into the U.S.
fur market. The principal source of fur seals are the

Pribilof Islands off Alaska. here, the sealing is strictly
controlled by the U.S. Government, under a l9ll treaty with
Canada, Russia and Japan designed to protect the herds.

The herdg which in l9l2 was estimated at 2l5,900, has now been increased_gy
this conservation program to its present level of over l.S million animals.
The three-and four-year-old bachelor males, considered surplus, make up the
bulk of the harvest. They are killed quickly and painlessly by a single
blow on the skull by experienced Aleut residents.

-Veterinarian Elizabeth Simpson, in a report published by the Zurich-based
World Federation for the Protection of Animals, told of her observations
during a Pribilof harvest. The kill of bachelor males, she noted, is directed
towards maintaining the herd at a level which will produce its maximum
sustainable yield. As to humaneness of the methods employed, she found ”no
evidence that any fur seal had been skinned while still alive.”

According to the United States Department of the Interior, its

policy is to conduct its programs ”in conformity with accepted
principles for humane treatnent of animals.”

indeed. testimony given =r the hearings before the Canadian Parliament has

shown that the films aepicting cruelty actually were staged for that purpose.

The Canadian Government says it has signed declarations from the hunters
Involved that they were_paid to stage it.

The Endangered Species

As for the endangered species, our industry, contrary to impressions created

by over-zealous conservationists, does not favor indiscriminate destruction

of animals for the sake of their precious hides. It would be quite unrealisticg
at the very_least, for us to disregard our future supply of raw material. '

Despite the cries raised regarding the impending disappearance of certain
species of wildlife, the fact is that vegy few species are actually threatened
with extinction. The authority on this subject is the international Union

for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) based on Morges,
Switzerland, whose Red Data Book is constantly brought up to date with reports
on the status of virtually every known specie all over the world. According
to this high authority, of the few species threatened with extinction, only

two or three gie used for fur purposes -- the majority are killed in defense
of humans and domestic animals.

The most wanted -- leopards,sjaguars and cheetahs -- are not

listed as in danger of extinction. Moreover, these animals, in past
years have accounted for less than i percent of the furs sold

in the U.S. The vast bulk of other furs sold here is in species
that are ranch-raised specifically for their furs.

In addition, expanding world pOpulation has restricted the lands and food
available to wild animals. This fact accounts for most of the reduction of

animal p0pulation, and has nothing to do with the activities of the fur
industry.

Aside from the ranch-raised animals and those under controlled-harvest
programs, for which accurate statistics are available, exact population data
does not generally exist. This is mainly due to inaccessible habitats,
irregular migratory patterns and seasonal Factors.

One of the most reliable profiles of wild animal populations comes from
trade sources, whose data are compiled frOm daily contact with collectors,
traders and game and wildlife officials throughout the world. Some of their
authoritative and up-to-date estimates include:

Beaver -- increased tenfold in the past half-century, despite
increased hunting and trapping. Pepulation rise credited to
natural propagation and sound trapping practices administered
by Federal and State governments.

Fitch -- Fairly scarce, it has limited use as a U.S. fur. Many
countries are trying to exterminate this animal because of crop
damage. It is believed the vast majority are killed by
extermination rather than for fur use.

Jaquar, Ocelot and Marqay -- P0pulations so abundant that the
animals find it difficult to obtain food and often invade human
p0pulated areas in search of sustinence.

Leopard -- Population and production of skins relatively steady,
especially south of the Sahara. Skins sold at government-sponsored
auttions in several countries and exported legally.

Lynx -- North American population slightly increased in the pas
30 years; Russian p0pulation steady. -

Muskrat, Nutria and Raccoon -- Populations have increased so
.tremendously that they have become a nuisance, destroying some farm
areas. Over-population in these species is leading to self-
destruction, as animals struggle for survival.

Pine Marten -- An American animal not frequently used for fur.
Declining population believed partially due to lack of a
trapping season.

 

Red Fox -- Populations increasing in some areas, decreasing in others.
Many U.S. states maintained bounties during periods when fox furs were
out of style. During these periods, p0pulation declined -- typical

of what usually occurs when there is no hunting and opposite to what
happens when reasonable hunting takes place.

 




l_u_

Snow Leopard -— Quite scarce. Principal source is Russia, where the
skins are auctioned by the government.

Sguirrel -- Populations limited by diseases such as rabies; also considered
a nuisance in many areas. Production for fur purposes in areas where

best qualities exist is more limited because hunting is discOuraged

by low prices.

Tiger -- Various conservation publications indicate different estimated
p0pulations. Probably rather limited. Most tiger hunting is done by
sportsmen for trophies or because of menace to local human p0pulation.

White Fox -- The population of this animal varies in a cyclical fashion;
pOpulation reported in the up-trend part of the cycle at this time.

Wild Mink -- Population declining in areas where prices are low and
trapping has been reduced. in areas who“: pelts bring better prices,
production is up sharply.

The fur industry, through the Amalgamated Meat Cutters 8 Butcher workmen

of North America and their affiliated for workers locals, the American

Fur Merchants Association, the Associated Fur Manufacturers, the Council

of American Fur Organizations, and other allied groups, has vigorously supported and
helped guide realistic legislation through Congress aimed at protecting

endangered species. The recent bill passed by Congress represents the

cooperative efforts of various industry groups working with conservationist
organizations and the interior Department.

However, we in the United States cannot legislate for other countries, and we
cannot accomplish our goals unilaterally. Until some universal action is

taken throughout the world, little can be done to remove the threat to
some of the species.

Experience with Alaska seals, the sea otter and even the American buffalo
has demonstrated effectively how controlled harvesting not only can conserve
a specie but actually can aid its prOpagation. it has been proved, for
example, that up to 40 percent of the male buffalo in a herd must be killed

in order to protect the herd from greater self-destruction and to insure its
steady growth.

It is unfair and presumptuous to assume that the members of the fur
industry are cruel or ruthless in the pursuit of their work. They are
responsible and conscientious men who are well aware of the dangers of
animal extinction and are therefore doubly dedicated to the aims of
conservation and to the day when men, industry and wildlife gag live
together.

The tactics of over-zealous conservationists and humane society members are not
the answer, even if their efforts were wholly justified. Perhaps they would do
better to redirect some of their energies toward man's inhumanity, not to
animals, but to man himself.

Dear Dr. Vintor,

PloaSo forgive me for this long delay in writing you as Mrs.
Stevens asked me to acknowledge your letter to her of November 13th.
She has been in New York since early'in October because her hquand
had a mild coronary. He is recovering vory'woll now and they’oxpoot
to be back in Washington for the holidays. They did not go to Japan
last Fall as Mr. Stevens business plans were changed.

I have written to the Fur Information and Bosnian Council for
the materials you need and I will forward them on to you just as soon
as they arrive.

While I am writing you i am going to ask an impossible question!
Do you think you could tell me a date which I could tell the people who
have ordered "Facts About Furs”, that is an estimated date of publication.
I do have to let all the people know; as many of them have already paid
for the book and have begun to write and ask. I thﬁught I would write
up some sort of form letter to tell them that it will be approximately'
380 long" before books are available. I will wait to hear from you be.
fore I do this. This isn't meant to put any'proosuro on you, Dr. Vinter,
but I am sure that your "guess" will be much better than mine. '

vory'bost wishes for the holidays to you from everyone here!

be completed in time for me to bring it with me when I come to Inndon
on or about September 28th.

more have been two hearings and two more are scheduled on
the Ocean Manuals bills. I believe we will get a good piece of
legislation,for the the Chairman of the Subcmmittee is tremendously
interested in the bobject. From the information elicited at yester-
days hearings things are not so rosy with the Pribilof seals as people
have._ been led to believe. The spokesman for the National Marine
Fisheries Service who are responsible ﬁade a very poor showing indeed
in answering the many legitimate questions directed at them by the
Chairman. Further mvisions will orobsbly have to be made in the
sealing chapter based on facts ascertained at these hearings. I'll
try to wk on these on the plane coming to England as I don't expect
to have the typescript till just before leaving.

Best wishes,

Soars,

Dear Christine,

many thanks Ior your undated letter &
enClosure. I did not answer at once as K was
wond ring what I ought to do. I cannot efiord to put
down a large sum of money but 1 could lend you £500
free of interest tor a year. Would that enable you
to publish ? I am very anxious that the booklet
should not be delayeo as it will get so out oi date,
as you realise.

I have prepared a list 01 about 12
names and adores: . oi Qeople who ought to receive
.ree copies and who will be uselul in making the
ork known. 1 will hold the list ior the moment in

case iurther names come to my mind.

Any hope 01 the typeseriot coming
torough to me soon ior indexing ?

Dear Jean,

Thanks for sending the impressive new manuscript "Facts About
Furs" which I read with great interest. You have done an enonmous
ammunt of valuable work. I have written a draft Fbreword,,some mate-
rial which might be inserted in the chapter on sealing, and various
minor additions and deletions throughout. I am enclosing the major
potential additions with this letter so you can look them.over and
make suggestions on theme

Also, there were a number of questions which occurred to me as
I read through, and I would appreciate your help in answering them -
they are in order of appearance in the manuscript.

1) Did H.V; Thompson make changes and additions after he read
it. Could you tell me generally where and what they are, if so?

2) Why has the total figure of trapped animals dropped from
53 to 22 million since 1957? Can we be sure that this is accurate?
I find some explanation on the question under the Russian numbers, but
I think we need anything further we can get to explain this big change
in statistics. What is your impression?

3) Do you knew which states in the U.S.A. prohibit the Coni~
bear trap?

h) I note (IV,12) reference to cyanide containers on traps.’
Why couldn't they be used by Fish and Wildlife in the U.S.A., instead
of Diazepam, since they don't seem able to get off the ground with
Diazepamﬂ Hare you any thoughts on this or have you had correspondence?

5) On page V8, what is "Koinsky"?
{ What is the source of the reasons given for the decrees in
export of furs? '
A total of 5,105,000 ex orted wild furs is given. On page
I,3 a total of "over five mdllionﬁ Is given again, but this could not
include the wild furs consumed within ther.S.S.R. Are any figures
available on internal use of wild furs?

 




3
-2 up

6) On page V,9, WFPA is referred to with respect to Bugoslavia
but no information is given on methods of catching animals there. Do
you think WFPA2might have this?

7) Shall I try to get more recent U.S.A. figures than those
given on page v.13, or have you already tried. I'm not sure how often
they are compiled.

8) Enclosed is a copy of S. 1116 which needs to be referred to
on page VI,1. I need your thoughts on the revision I worked on before
receiving your second batch.of’materis1 today, but I will delaynsending
it till I have an opportunity to read your new material thoroughly. As
you can see from the enclosed law, there is strong public demand for
ekimination of all seal killing.

9) Referring to page v.5, does anyone know what methods the
Russians use to kill the Whitecoats?

10) Re page V1.8, Tom Hughes says there are £2,Norwegian regulau
tions in force! I wanted to recheck this with you.

11) I wondered why you begin this chapter with the wearing of wolf
furs. Would it not be preferable to start with.the people who use nylon,
cotton, and down in the Antarctic? Is it necessary to mention the wolf
fur wearers at all?

12) Can you give me the dates when you were Technical Secretary

of UFAW? Are there other organizations that should be mentioned in identi-
fying you and your work for the reader who does not know you? Please
send me anything that ought to be included here.

Again, grateful thanks for this important work. we expect to have
new bills on trapping introduced in the Congress this year, so “Facts
About Furs" is likely to be in demand.

Yours,

Christine Stevens
President

Dear Jean,

I hope your hateful cold is gone by the time you receive
this. I'm.so glad Facts is nearly done. Yes, I think your
idea about preparing the words to fill in with.numbers of
pages for the index is wise, for I know preparing a good
index requires time, and we can be working on having a
foreword written in the meantime.

Shall we send you as many copies as you think will
be sold in England when the book is published? Can you,
through one of the organizations you work with, arrange
for reviews and sales ghere?

Please express our thanks to H.V. Thompson for read-
ing the manuscript. We appreciate it. Most of all we_
appreciate your hard work in preparing it.

What do you hear of Charles Hume? I haven't heard
from.him.for some time and hope he is all right.

Yours,

P.S. Tom Hughes has just sent me a great deal of

Dear Jean,

The printer has promised us galley proofs by the end of
the week. I found a note which indicated that you wanted six
copies, but this seems unlikely, so I will be dispatching two
by airmail Just as soon as they reach me. However, if you do
need another copy, let me know. II will be sending one to the
RSPCA at the same time that yours go off, also one to the Cardings.
Tom Hughes and CAHT have seen the carbon copy, and I don't think
there is anyone else on this side of the Atlantic who needs to see
it before it goes into page proof.

It will be wonderful to have it out, and it is going to
appear at exactly the right time for efforts in this country. It
was worth all the tremendous work you put into it.

Best wishes,

Yours,

Dear Dr. Vinter,

Your telegram arrived today for Mrs.
Stevens. She left for Ehrepe on the 16th
and will arrive in London on the 1st of
June, I believe to stay there until the
9th of June. They will be at the Connaught
Hotel, if you should wish to call her there.

Perhaps you would want to hold the photo-

graph there to show her and then she could

bring it home with her.
Best wishes.

Dear Mrs. Mason,

Thank you for your inquiry about "Facts About
Furs." Dr. Vinter now has the page proof in her
possession, and we are hoping that it will not be too
much longer before the booklet will be in print. It
has been a big job. We are eager to distribute it
and try to help the trapped animals.

Yours sincerely,

....... It may be used as e powder or as e paste.

1. The powder is either made into a bait the size of a small garden
pee or is inserted into a gelatine capsule which, after Iilling, is
dipped in melted wax. The bait or two cepsules should be set in s
teaspoonful of flour ecented with oil of eniseed and placed on the
opossum run. These preparations kill very quickly.

2. The cyanide paste is factory - packed in 1,000-dose plastic
containers which resemble large tooth-paste tubes and hold 1 lb. of
paste. The haste consists of sodium cyanide, soya-bean oil and
gelling agents, mixed to the consistency oi soit grease. This
preparation is safe to handle, is easy to lay in the iield, and
retains its toxicity in light’rein and heavy dew. Unfortunetely it
acts more slowly than the powder. If the poison area contains domestic
stock, the blob of pests is applied high up on trees or poles;

Dear Sirs,

I am writing a 2nd edition of Bacts about

Pure and it is now nearly ready to be printed by the

Animal Welfare Institute of_the U.S.A. I should like
to include a good picture of a Conibear trap, 550 or
120. Could you supply a good photograph ? or pive
permission for reproduction of one of the drawings
contained in your "Instructions for Setting the
Victor Conibear Trap " ? I think drawing No 10 is a
good one to give an idea oi what the trap is like.

I should be most grateful if you would
send direct to His. Stevens, Animal Welfare Institute,
1686 34th Street,N.W., Washington, 3.0. 20007, as
soon as possible any help or permission that you are
able to grant her, and any Qhote or drawing that can
be reproduced.

With thanks,
I am,

ANSWERS TO LETTER OF July 12th, 1971.
l) The words in brackets reier only to the animal mentioned within the
same commas e.g. ,mermot (shot),

My intention was to give soecific information , if I had it, on the
killing 01 animals by means other than those mentioned in the heading i.e.
trapping, snoring, ooisoning.

Under South.America and USA 1 put in (lethold trapping) to try to
emphasize the fact that nutrie and muskret are trapped, contrary to
popular belief. However, 1 was not consistent so I advise taking out
(leghold trapped) when it occurs. I just do not know how the South

American species are taken, I suppose by a variety oi means.

2) The term Carecul occurs in standard text hooks7where it indicates a
sheep difierent from Kerakul. However, 'he furriers do not appear to use

this term now and the word should be omitted.

3) I suggest inserting (British) before Retail Trading-Stenderds Associatinn

Inc. 322

4
) ' Killing or taking ' is the lengusge used in the legislation,preeumebly
to cover all humans tress , whether they be killer or case traps, I
suggest that you omit 'kilLing or tsking' and Just put 'ror rebbxts..

7) my information about Austrian traps is confused. Leghold traps

are illegal und r national legislation but H.V.Thompson tola me that
they may be permitted by some provincial legtsletion. I have been
told that in Vienna Tellereisen {leghold trees) and Schwenenhaelse
(swan-neck traps) ere prohibited, I do not know about the other
provinces. Port of a letter from s hunting organization, written in
German, desoribes “liit irons with steel bow being used for ioxes,
martens and polecets, and wooden balance traps for weesels". I suppose
the tree with steel bow is the swan-nook trap used in Germany, q.v.

I expect the Austrian treps,like the Norwegian ones, often meim instead
of killing. As I have no good contests in Austria I am doubtful if

I can get better information.

8) I have again consulted my translator who egress that the Mexican
game laws are well set out. She is Arsentinion and tells me that
throughout South America lows ere not resoected so that, although the
Authorities do their best and deserve a not on the back, the animals

do not beneiit. Pe base you could add the worse ” but are difiicult to

eniorce".

9) I think the Australian Conservation boundetion is quite excellent
but realises that it can get nowhere ii it olienetes the graziere.

I suggest that you add the words ” and not es a continually hunted
and harried poouletion" to the words on page V 17 ” 2.Kongaroos

should be maintained in reasonable numbers, but below pest level n

The 5rd paragraph on page V 18 could then be omitted. Reference 2

10) Mink are handled several times during their lives. Kits should be
handled many times, adults are inoculated twice and also have a blood
test done. Aoporently melee and females play by holding each other's
tails and they tolerate being held by the tail by humans. A good mink

breeder can hold and inject euthetal into a mink single-handed without

causing resentment or soreeming. This method, like any other, can be

used badly.

I have esked e mink breeder whether barbiturate by mouth would be
feasible. He thinks that mink might detect it in the food, however
tasteless it is. He also iears that a mink might fall about and damage
its pelt. As far as I know this has not been tried. What preparation
is used by the Humane Seeiety of Weshtenaw County ? Phenobarbitone ?

As the method is quite untried I would certainly not put any stress on
it. Can you deduce the necessary dose of whatever preparation is used ?
If so mention it if you like. Injection of oentobarbitone is a method

of proved humeneness.

I do not think that it is possible to use an inhalationel method
on on animal without causing feet and I personally would have thought
that chloroform was inferior to 002 or motor-ear exhaust, but out it
under Reasonably Humane methods if you like. I do not think that anyone
uses an inheletionel method now in this country, they use neck breaking,
pentoberhitone injection or cyanide inhalation.

The new UFAW~Hendbook on the Care and management of Eerm Anionic
has a mink chapter in which a truly horrible electrical killing method
is described with the current not passing through the head; 1 have POinted

this out to Scott.

In reply to our letter of 6.3.70 they are informing us that in
their country the following animals are killed for their fur:
polecat, marten, musk, hamster, mole, (swamp)nutria, fox, otter,
wildcat, housecat, mink, hare, Persian lamb, horse, calf, bilch?,
ree?, squirrel and sheep. '
Hunters do the killing.
They wrote to the Slovenian Hunter Union and got the answer, owing
to conditions of the time being;=hunting has only recreative character
and only some kinds of martens are killed for their furs
During the hunting season 1968/69 560 gold and white martens have
been killed in the regions of some hunting unions. They are mostly
shot and only a small proportion is trapped in special traps which
kill the animals at once.
Breding of fur animals is donb by the following firms:
"SEMESADIKE" Menges near Ljubljana ans "AGROKOMBINAT" Ljubljana
mostly mink. They ask to apply for further information to these
firms, as they themselves don't know details of their technology
of breeding.
Mink, nutria and chinchilla (see press cuttings) are also breeded
on special farms in various Slovenian places, as well as polar foxes
on a farm near Beograd.
Most pf the animals hunted by hunters are shot. In traps caught animals
are killed afterwards. On the farms the animals are killed by poison.
On no account can they give details , which are a hundert percent sure,
as to get such they would have to make inquiries, which would take to
long. But if we wish they could extent their action but are not sure
that they could finish it before end of 1970. But they will continue
to be interested and try to get answers to the questions asked and
inform us further. -

\

so Generalry the animals are found dead, out this does not mean a great

deal as the actual springing or the trap and capture or the animal is

rarely witnessed. itere is therefore no valid survey of this question. I
iron the field. I am attaching one eye-witness report in which a heave Ciﬂkhﬂl
was killed very swiftly. 85% of reports from trappers state that there ‘dtr
was no sign of struggle, but again this is inconclusive because if the (10¢.
animal is held securely he may not be able to move but may well be alive aghad’}
and conscious. A photographic study is needed. \aY ,

3) As above,there is not adequate evidence. Most animals are dead by
the time they are found. We have one report of a beaver being pulled
out of the water alive. Presumably the stunning blow lost sens strength
by being set in the water and the beaver was able to struggle to the

Hunting Areas, Harp_ Seal and Hood Seal.

 

Both the ﬁarpuﬁeal and ﬁeodﬁeal herds of the North Atlantic
and Arctic have been very severely depleted by over-hunting.
They are hunted off the east coast of Canada in two main
areas : the Gulf, which is divided into three districts, and '
the Front?) The Gulf is within the Gulf of Sto Lawrence and

the hunting there is by Canadians. The Front is the front edge

of the ice north and east of Newfoundland and Labrador, where

i ‘ the hunting is done by Canadians and Norwegians. The Nor‘wegiganﬁrliZQDEﬁ?‘

hunt ofi Greehland and the Norwegians also hunt in the area of Jan
mayen Island and Spitsbergen and in the White Sea; in 1970 they
were permitted by their Minister of bisheries to take 14,000 harp

the White Sea, and also in the bering7ﬁlack and Caspian Seas; half

Norwegian sealers now receive prior slaughterhouse training
and most of them kill the young seals expertly. They use a
spiked axe called a hakapik and deliver two blows to the head,
the first with the ﬂat of the axe and the second with the spike.
They bleed the seals by cutting the (IXLUK/L'LVUK (Leta—«95 before

The cruelty and waste of sealing methods, on the Front was
first revealed in 1949S13)but few changes were made until
1964 when the Canadian Government, urged on by humane
organizations, began to issue Regulationé2)to cover Canadian
sealing. In 1970, for the first time, the Opening date of
the hunt, formerly about March 7th, was postponed until
' March 20th in the Gulf and March 22nd in the Front, so
that the pups killed would be older, and killing of Whitecoats
in Gulf districts 2 and 3 was prohibited?” Before the 1970
season, actually started agreement was reached between the
Canadian and Norwegian Ministers of Fisheries that all
killing of Whitecoats in the Gulf and the Front should be
prohibitedQB) In 1970 the pups were clubbed as Moulters

Norwegian sealers now receive prior slaughterhouse training

and most Qicthem kill the young seals expertly. T -y use a
spiked axe called a hakapik and deliver two blows to ' e head,
the first with the ﬂat of the axe and the second with the spike.
They bleed the seals by cutting the QXi/CLMUG wﬂuez’s efore

British humane killer traps have been tried out in Canada; but its

Z they do not stand up to Canadian weather conditions. ThEy could be

used further,§outh for rabbits and the smaller fur bearers.

The most satisfactory killer trap is the Victor Conibear; which
was invented by a trapper in British Columbia and came on the market
in 1958. It was first teeted under the auspices oi the Vancouver
Association for the Protection oi Fur Bearing Animals and was developed
by the British Columbia Research Council at the instigation of the
British Columbia S.P.C.A. It is a vertical break-back trap which is
triggered off when an animal touches a couple oi wire whiskers; it
tends to spring up as the animal is caught, which is a humane
advantage because it makes a lethal blow to the head more likely._;“

Ebar Jean,

I have gone over the manuscript of Facts About Furs again, insert-y
ing all the corrections and new material, and on rereading I have a few
remore questions, some more details, others of importance. I've listed

them in the order they occur. .

1) On pages I h and 5 when parenthetical information on the method
of capture is given does this apply only to the animal just before the
parentheses, or to all the animals before. When there are no parentheses
does that have any specific meaning? Perhaps we need a sentence clarify- .
ing this, but I don't want to write one which is not accurate.

2) On page I,S, the word "Caracul" appears. Is this the same as
"Karacul" which appears elsewhere and is there a choice between the two
spellings, if so?

3) On page I ,6, the reference to Retail Trading-Standards Associa-
tion, Inc., should I think be identified by the City where its head-
quarters are. Is it London?

A) On page IV ,2, why is the phrase "for killin§ or taking" used?
Since the traps are killer traps I don't underStand Taking,“ but you
may have a reason or a point not clear to no, so I thought it best to .
ask before removing the words "or taking." *

; 5) On page IV, 8, is it Prentice-Hall, New York or Longon?

6) On page IV ,13, what identification can be used following ,
’ The.§§£%%2%22%33 0n 3h” 33MB page , and elBBWhﬂPG. I am putting the word “
"ﬁrit s n rent of "Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.” - '

7) On page V,2, a reference is made to "quick-killing traps" used
in Austria. Do you know whether these are manufactured in Austria? It
would be good to know the names of any quick-killing traps, where they
are made and how they work. ‘ ,

8) On page V ,ii, I wonder whether the last sentence, ”The game
laws are ver clearly set out” suggests that hunting is welluregulated
‘« Mexico. find this hard to believe. At any rate, I gather the

 




2.

, simply removing the sentence, I thought it best to consult you as you n
**'have the original source material. Perhaps the sentence should be media
fied rather than stricken. 4 . ~ ~

9) On page V, 18, I have been worrying over how to deal with the
quotation from the Australian Conservation Foundation which I find singu~
larly offensive in its first two phrases, but very useful in the last one.
Knowing the way the lobbyists for the sheep owners who graze their ' '
sheep on federal lands in the U.S.A. work, I know how false the so—called
_"Justifiable anxiety" they4experioncs actually is. .The sheep farmers in _
Australia are vven worse than the American.ones, as far as I can-learn,
since they gamble on the rainfall and when it doesn't come huge numbers
of sheep die of hunger and thirst in Australia. Also, they send_sheep
by ship to the U.S.A. under the most ghastly conditions. SoyI don't
want anything in,a book published by the AWI which would bolster their
position. I do think, though, that the comment about "a continually ,
hunted and harried population” of kangaroos is good, and I would like
to use it. can you rephrase thepparagraph to eliminate the public rela-
tions for sheep farmers? " " _ ~

_ 10) On page IX,8, "Inhalation of chloroform" is classed under "other
methods." Do you not think this should be under the "reasonably humane"-
category?’ Actually, do you feel really sure that injection, however
humans the doing, is more humane than chloroform, 002, or CO inhalation
for a wild creature that fears being handled? There can be a lot of
cruelty with needles in the hands of rough people, and as you point out
earlier, many of these farmed animals resist handling very strenuously,
One other thought would not the wild carnivores eat meat with sleeping
pills embedded_in it just as dogs will do? There is no doubt that if
animals will do this it is by far the most humane method of euthanasia.,
~ AtiheVHMmane Society of Washtenaw County the dogs are killed in this‘man~

it ‘ner. They simply fall asleep after their last dinner and never wake up.

Another variation is to give enough barbiturate orally to put them t0]
sleep but not to kill them and then to ensure death by a second method.
*This is now being done at the pound in the District of Columbia where we
have been complaining about their use of the Euthanair.. We finally got.
'them to give the dogs barbiturates in meat an hour before putting'thmmea
in the Euthanair, and there is no problem any more. f

Do let me knou whether you think this would be practical.' It seems
to me it would be a lot easier to give them.a feed full of barbiturate
and not have to handle them.at all. - . ' , _

11) On page X,3, referring to the production of broadtail by Cassarean
Section, the_sontenoe, "It is unlikelythat this is now true," follows. ..'
We will probably be asked why it once was true but is not now. Could you
let me know why the change would have occurred? ' v

12) The Appendix. I am not clear why we should give the_coyote scent
formula. There are great numbers of lures for different species.of course,
available commercially, but do we want to provide informatibn on how to
'make them? Let me know if there is a reason which escapes me. A

On the exhaust systems, it is doubtless useful to provide informed ..
tion. Ought we, to be consistent, show, also, how to use 002 and chloro~ ’
*'form if we showthis? Do you have information on actual use by mink,

ranchers of either 002 or chloroform? ' " : ‘

 




3.

Sorry to ask so many questions, but it's better to ask now than
later. There is no question that you chose exactly the right tima to
revise Facts About Furs. YOu have done a tremendbus job.

Yburs,

"sf
ANSWERS TO LETTEa OF July 12th, 1971.
l) The words in brackets refer only to the animal mentioned Within the
same commas e.g. ,Eﬁrmoy (ShOt);
my intention was to give specific information , if I had it, on the
killing 01 animals by means other than those mentioned in the heading i.e.
trapping, snaring, poisoning.

Under South America and USA I put in (legholdtrapping) to try to
emphasize the fact that nutria and muskrat are trapped, contrary to
popular belief. However, I was not consistent so I advise taking out
(leghold trapped) when it occurs. I just do not know how the south

American species are taken, I sugp0se by a variety 01 means.

2) The term Caracul occurs in standard text books)where it indicates a
sheep difierent from Karakul. However, the furriers do not appear to use

this term now and the word should be omitted.

3) I suggest inserting (British) before Retail Trading-Standards Associatiad

Inc. ans

4) ‘ Killing or taking ' is the language used in the legislation,presumably
to cover all humane traps , whether they be killer or cage traps. I
suggest that you omit 'killing or taking' and just put ‘For rabbits..
tor squirrels etc.‘

5) Prentice—Hall, New Yerk.

6). This should be Agriculture, not The Agriculture. It is the Journal

oi the(§ritish)ﬁinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The date

of the reference is 1966.

 




  
   
   
    
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
    
   

    

7) my information about Austrian traps is confused. Leghold traps
are illegal und r national legislation but H;V.Thompson told me that
they may be permitted by some provincial legislation. 1 have been

told that in Vienna Tellereisen (leghOld traps) and Schwanenhaelse
(swan-neck traps) are prohibited, I do not know about the other
provinces, Part of a letter from a hunting organization, written in
German, describes "liit irons with.steel bow being used for ioxes,
martens and polecats, and wooden balance traps ior weasels". l SUDQOSG
the trap with steel bow is the swan-neck trap used in Germany, 90V-

I expect the Austrian traps,like the Norwegian ones, often maim instead

of killing. is I have no good contacts in austria I am doubtiul ii

 

I can get better iniormation.

8) I have again consulted my translator who agrees that the MBXican
game laws are well set out. She is Argentinian and tells me tﬂab)
throughout South America,laws are net respected so that, although the

Authorities do their best and deserve a pat on the back, the animals

    
   
  

do not beneiit. Perhaps you could add the words " but are diiiicult to

eniorce".

9) I think the aeatralian Conservation roundation is quite excellent

   
 
   
   
   
   
   
   
      

but realises that it can got nowhere if it alienates the graziers.
I suggest that you add the words " and not as a continually hunted
and harried population“ to the words on page V 17 " 2.Kangaroos

should be maintained in reasonable numbers, but below pest level "

The 5rd paragraph on page V 18 could then be omitted. Reference 2

could be omitted at this point as it occurs elsewhere; it should more

 

correctly read .. Ratcliffe F, The Commercial Hunting_gi
Occasional Publication No. 4lof the Australian Conservation

lO) Mink are handled several times during their lives. hits should be
handled many times, adults are inoculated twice and also have a blood

test done. Apparently males and females play by holding each other's

 

tails and they tolerate being held by the tail by humans. A good mink

I have asked a mink breeder whether barbiturate by mouth would be

tasteless it is. he also lears that a minh might fall about and damage

I do not think that it is possible to use an inhalational method
on an animal without causing fear and I personally would have thought

that chloroform was inferior to 002 or motor-car exhaust, but put it

The new UFAW Handbook on the Care and management of Farm Anianls

       
 

has a mink chapter in which a truly horrible electrical killing method

    
   

is described with the current not oassing throng h the head; I have pointed

this out to Scott.

ll) my Russian iniormant does not want to be ouoted , that is Why I
did not give the reasons for saying that induced abortions are not
practised. I have now altered the Whole paragraph and given the Eiges
reference, if he allows it I will add his name later. I have written to him
Moscow.

The whole harakul section struck me as badly written and I have

now re-written it as enclosed.

12) I included the coyote lure because it has proved satisiactory ior

description of dts savoury nature would be an eye-opener to some readers,

as it was to me. However, omit it ii you like.

5. The Humane Coyote Getter is used in Canada and the Unlted states. It

consists of a small gﬁfrlgaded with a cyanide cartridge. Theeé;%f§s
placed in the ground and-ﬁe covered with a baited cap; when the coyote
pulls at the bait cyanide is shot into its mouth, usually killing it
quickly so that it dies within 100 yards of the set. The outfit is
obtainable from Humane Coyote Getter Inc., P.O.Box 2172, Pueblo,

Colorado. It is essential to have a good scent to attract the animal to

the set; that recommended by the Sapervisor, CrOp Protection and Pest

Dear Dr Vinter,

Dr Armstrong had just sent me your proofs, asking
for comment; but now I can reply to you direct.

Our comments on Galley 14 are these 2
Line 5. For ”Rabbit Boards" read "Pest Destruction Boards"

(their present name)

Line 10. After "hggﬁpne" add ”, hunted with dogs, and shot
at night using a spotlight"

Line 45. For "from 1951~60" read "from 1951~61"

Line 21. Omit “In pest areas, therefore, the aim is to
exterminate the Opossum". (This is incorrect; the
policy is one of control, not extermination.)

We have no comments on Galleys 7 and 8.

Yours sincerely,

Please reply to;

Washington, D.C. 20007

Dear Jean,

I am.making the vast majority of corrections you sent, and
here are a few notes.

Ch. 1, p.4. There was quite a stir about a year ago in the
U.S.a. when a Jacques Kaplan ﬂbdel wearing a skirt made from
domestic cat skins was featured in 222 new York Times. It was
not a style that caught on, to put it1nTley, but also it cer-
tainly wasn't a Russian apprentice who made the skirt, so I am
not putting in anything about apprentices but merely leaving it
at "The cat skins are mainly Russian." I feel a bit doubtful
about "wild or semiawild dogs" from nongolia. Does this refer
to a species of wild dogs or is feral dogs intended?

Ch. 6. I agree that the "scientific" attempts to electrocute
seals were nasty and stupid and have so stated. ”However, the
testimony before the Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife Con-
servation shows that the Pribilof sealing is not the "shingng
example" we have all been led to believe. The enclosed Information
Report gives just a bit of the information elicited by Congressman
Dingell showing that they killed far too many females because of
the flipper tagging which caused so many needless deaths. Stupidity,
boondoggling and commercialism have been rife. However, it cer-
tainly is £§£Lbetter than the many horrors connected with killing
other fur bearers. I hope we can help to direct the outrage against
trapping. That, incidentally, is the reason I use words like
"torture" and "agony" in the foreword. If we are too understated
we cannot, at least in most parts of the world, hepe to get action.

I defer to you on all the extensive research you have done and
make every change you suggest which is based on this research, but,
the information on the record now simply makes it impossible for the
Animal Welfare Institute to defend the Pribilof scaling to the
extent that you would like to defend it. Only last week I ran into
Dr. MacLeod from.New Brunswick, a veterinarian, who has personally
been on the ice and who states without qualification that Pribilof
sealing is much crueller than that in the Gulf. I have out most, but

 




Dr. Vinter ~2- 12.8.71

not all, of the firet three paragraphs in the sealing chapter, and
enclose a papy of page one as eeverely trimmed. If this still
bothers you, and you feel heeitetnt about putting your name as author
to eomething “in the thick of the fray” how would it be to credit

you with the research and collection of date only? I will be glad

to take the blame for the editing if that would solve the problema

Ch. IX, p.11. Do you have a copy of British Standard 2909,
1957? Should it be included in the Appendix? We should have a
oopy in our files in order to reply to questions about it.

The printer now has the manuscript, and as soon as he has com,
pleted the galley proof, copies will be sent to you and the RSPCA.

Best wishes,

Ybure,

Dr. F. Jean Vinyer
6 Hershaa.Rbad 5’
Walton eonefhaaes
Surrey, England

Dear Jean,

I am working on the final corrections of proof and so will
write this letter in stages as I go along. My first question:
What is the situation as you see it in the USSR? Yuu suggest
deletion of the paragraph in the foreword which quotes the figures
from the first and second editions of Facts About Furs, and it
concerns me that quoting these figures should somehow fail to
give the right information. Do we need further explanation in
the body of the text if the contrast of these fugures in the
foreword would give the wrong understanding?

The suggestions for changes in phraseology in the Foreword
have been made. I have heard nothing further from.the RSPCA
but will write again. On galley 3, Chapter II. References, the
date of Charles Hume's Control gg’ﬁodents is difficult to read.
Could you give it to us aglin? ‘

With regard to WFPA's suggestions on the kangaroos, I think
it would be a good plan to publish these EE.WFPA’3 suggestions.
Australian officials naturally want to put a less gloomy light
on the situation, and I think the WFPA ideas may help.

Regarding the changes suggested in the chapter on sealing,
I regret to say that the board of the AWI is not willing to publish
Facts About Furs if these further changes are made. I am sorry
there should So any disagreement, but the Pribilofs are part
of the United States and it is out of the question for us to reject
the views of so many American humanitarians who have watched the
process, and , in some cases, filmed it. I have seen two independ~
ently filmed sequences. Mrs. Simpson's visit was quite a long
time ago, and we can't accept uncritically a single point of View.
In particular I was distressed by the word "vicious" to describe
the actions of the seals. The AWI wouldnxt publish anything
in which animals are described as ViOiOUS‘When they are simply
reacting normally.

The whole question of sealing, now that it is proposed to
Open up the antarctic for the purpose, is becoming more and

 




' 5/3/72.v1nt¢er.p2

amore serious. As you may know, the National Audubon Society
has stated that it will organize a boycott of all seal products
if this happens.

I as: glad to may: the sentence about the Foukc Fur Company

without altering who text from a factual point of View. Certainly,
it is important for people who read Facts About Furs to know
that companies that have an interest In furs are prepared to
spend large sums to protect that interest. The furriers are out
lobbying again to weaken the MarineLMwmmal Protection Act whlhh
has passed the U.S. House of Representatives and is pending in
the Senate.

, I note the new title of Chapter VIII and think your alternate
szggcstion, "Muskrat and Ccypu" is a good one as Americans aren't ,
fr liar with the word “masquash".

AFL—CIO stands for the American Federation of Labor. This
is the big union to which.the Meat Cutters and Butcher Workman of
America belong. The fur workers belong to this too. The union is
a very powerful one, and sometimes they Join the furriers in
lobbying to considerable effect, as in blocking passage of the
Endangered Species Act for a year which.I think I wrote you
about. If I didn't, remind me, and I'll tell you all about it.

The address of FOE will go in, and also the Lacey sot.

About libel, in this country the libel laws are not so strict
as in England, so,I don't like to advise you without mentioning’
this, but I am sure there is not the slightest problem in this
country. Indeed, I feel the only fault this publiCation is
going to have is that it is so very restrained in dealing with
a horrendous subject. In the United States, at least, anyone
who has not been referred to in flattering terms would certainly
not wish to draw further attention to himself by a libel suit,
and after all your careful checking, I am sure there are no
inaccuracies which are unflattering.

There were some comments from Judith Symonds concerning
Canadian matters which I have worked into the text. They include
the development of the Conibear trap, the jurisdiction of the
federal and provinicial governments oner Indians, and things of
this kind. I'll send you page proof as soon as it is ready so
you can see these and other minor alterations.

Also , I am hoping to have a few days in London at the end
of May and will telephone you on my arrival so we can have a talk
in person. Considering what a lot of work has gone into this,
mostly on your part, but a lot on mine, too, the fact that hhe
only disagreement is on a small part of one chapter testifies to
a good working relationship. Looking back at your letter of

a painst abuse. Of W11 dllfe

By BRIAN MOORE
Platitudes about the importance of

i t r e a t 1 n g animals humanely have
mneVer interested Dr. Jean Vinter as

much as action to relieve their suf-
fering.

T h e 69-year-01d-V' Englishwoman’s
lifelong crusade against animal abuse
has taken her on a score of trips
throughout North Africa. ' ' ~

She has written a book —- soon
available in a revised and enlarged
second edition —-— attacking trapping
methods that inflict agony on wildlife.

She has given up her London med:

ical practice to concentrate on com-
batting cruelty.-

“I decided that animals had more
need of a champion than people,” she
says. “Having an MD .has given me
entree to laboratories, where animals
often are badly mistreated.

“A medical degree is taken as a
guarantee of being tolerably sane, so
the persons in charge are more will-‘-
ing to talk to me.”

In. Montreal this m o nth visiting

 

friends, Dr. Vinter. says Canada’s fur
industry rates low marks‘for‘its often
inhumane treatment of wildlife. Her
106-page book, F a cts About Furs,
takes aim at' the leg-hold trap,
banned in Great Britain but widely
used in North America.

It contains numerous photographs
of the trap’s victims: a beaver with
both front paws missing, gnawed off
in past escapes; a badger lying ina
two-foot-deep hole frantically dug in a
fruitless bid for freedom.

The book is published by the Ani-
mal Welfare Institute of Washington,
D. C.

“A British Columbia trapper

“n a m e (1 Frank Conibear invented a

kind of eggbeater device that kills
most animals instantly.

“Hopefully, the Conibear trap will
gradually replace the leg—hold type,

which Britain still exports in ashock-'

ing example of hypocrisy.”

mesticated livestock such as Persia
lamb, Dr. Vinter says.

“If the animal is to be killed fo
meat anyway”, use might as well be
made of its fur. But it’s criminal to
push a whole species to the edge of
extinction for the sake of fashion. ,

“British women realize they
shouldn’t wear spotted furs like ocelot
and leopard because of this danger}?

Cotton’s warm enough

British scientific crews stationed in
the Antarctic have ' even traded, in
their furs for parkas of wind-proof
cotton cloth, she adds. ,

“The “Chinese have always used
lothinginregions
with cold climates ”

She charges that Canadian breed.-
ers, in their haste to meet the de»
mand fer mink, too often ignore the
preferred killing method -— injection
with a barbituate, producing instanL
unconsciousness. ' , ,.

“Instead, they may use electrocue
tion, Which paralyses the mink but
doesn’t kill it outri ght. It dies within.

a few minutes from asphyxiation.

. “Injection with a lethal dose of
nicotine is even less desirable, be-x

cause it still leaves the mink cone 1

scious, although paraly Sed. ”

Dr. Vinter is an authority on dis» ,

patching animals humanely. .

She’s written a‘ pamphlet called
Kind Killing that tells the best spot .1
to shoot everything from pigs (be-
tween and slightly” above the eyes,
barr e1 tilted upward) to camels

(through the top of the head) to

stranded dolphins (‘two to three
inches behind the nostril at the rear
of the head).

One of her current concerns is

improving the lot of animals in f

1

Japan.

“There is no effective animal pro- -

tection law there. Lab animals, in
particular, receive unbelievably cal-
lous treatment.

“British cat breeders haVe refused
Japanese purchase offers, but unfor-
tunately many of our dog breeders
haven’t.” ..

A former field organizer with the
London-based Society for the Protec-
tion of Animals in North Africa, Dr.

1 Vinter helped set up shelters in

Tunis, Algiers, Casablanca, Marrak-
ech and other centres following the
Second World War.

“The English \have "a reputation
for caring about animals, although
too often they limit themSelves to
their pets.

“But on the Whole, I think animal

‘welfare is one of our greatest ex—
“ports. ”

JB/JS ’ 29th May, 1975

Dr. F.J. Vinter,
6 Hersham Road,
WALTON— ON-ThaM
Surrey, KT12 lJZ

Dear Dr. Vinter,
Thank you very much for your letter of 24th May.

There seems to have been some confusion on my part and that
of other people's about the "83%" figure. I am certain that this
figure was accurate when I used it in 1970 or, rather, 't was an
accurate quotation perhaps from a report, magazine or newspaper
article. Both Friends of the Earth and other people I know have
used the figure, not necessarily from my article but from other
sources. However, I spoke to the Secretary of the IFTF today and
he said that a more realistic figure would be about 55% for the
proportion of furs handled by the London fur market. About 80%
of the furs handled in London are ranch-bred and therefore between
15 and 20% of the furs are from wild species.

I really am sorry about the misleading statement I made but
at the time I was completely confident that it was an accurate
statement. I could not unite gather from your letter what form
the poster designed by? rier ds of the Earth takes; whether it has
been reprinted in the booklet or is being included as an insert.

I think if it is too late to correct, all one can say is that
some statements are now out of date. Again, I do apologise for
this happening.

With best wishes.

Yours sincerely,

T imagine that either you or the printer or both of
you have lost interest in "sects",whioh is now two years out 01 date:

If the printer is still preyated to go ahead would it
help 11 I dealt With him direct ? thus saving you,1 hepe,some labour.

Dear Dr. Vintsr,

I am enclosing a cepy 31' my letter to Mr. @avestock.
We were amazed to find that the 0.8. mail is actually more swansivs
than air height! At any rate, 1000 copies of the beak should be
in ENGLAND when you arrive home. I am assuming that is why yen
offered to take sans back with you in your luggage, to have them
available on your return. It mum cast quite a bit to sen! than

to Canada as I hope you can use those already in England, but if
net, let me Imam.

I have anclossd six capies of the book for you he use
than in 0mm. We are offering all humane sacietiss one free copy
of the book and they may purchase additional capies at cost price of $1. 00 a
w. (‘Ihis is actually a little balm: cost. price.)

Let us know how tbs intsrvisw went with the paper there in
Mammal. pm they send yen a clipping if the anti ale isn’t puhli shed
before you leave m ham?

You asked about the financi all arrangements with ths RSPCA.
We will be billing thsn $1. 00 per cnpy plus shipt s and packing costs.
The air shipment asst was $133.21» and I haven't lssrnsd what costs were
involved in the packing as of this date.

As men as we have the price ﬂan Mr. Gravestnck we will
canplets the mailing of tbs cmplinsntary copiss on year ii at.

31th hast wishss, I an

Dear Jean,

Thanks fer yaur letter 0f Decembar 13th. I am.glad
that Field~Fi$h£r has read the manuscript and finda no
objection except in tbs appendix. I have put in a mate on
tha offanding article indicating that it was inserted by
tha Editcr, thua yen will have no responsibility far it at
all. The article is in a very diffarent vain frem.tha rest
of tbs beak but adds a dimﬂnsien thereby which I think is
valid, particularly in View of the fact th§t theae fur organi~
nations which, essentially, are allowed to condamn thamﬁelves by
quotation fram.their awn mimaagraghed or printed materials,
have been suddealy craated to heaa off thﬂ effect of auch &
publication as Facta $bcut Furs.

Barbara wreta you about pages 90~99. ﬂhese were photo~
graphed fram tha official Enaangered Spacie$ and Lacey laws
raﬁhar than set in type, as this avoids any passible typo~
graphical arrorg craeping in.

$hanks for the figure on Finnish.mnakrat. I‘m.surpriaad
Christian Hieber haan’t crossed your path as we hﬁar & lot
about him have as a major internaticnal furrier.

The printer la warking an, and I hope we‘ll have final
Pﬁge*pbcof soon. ﬁg for tbs ﬂats, I thought simply 19?3
at the battam of tha title page would be aufficient unleas you
hava anothﬁr suggeatioa. The referance to Uﬁﬁw in the adknawa
ledgaments has bean eliminated. Why are thay se eager ta be left
cut?

Best wiSh£$ fer a ﬁappy 36w YEar!

Bear Jean,

Thanks so much for sending “Facts About Furs” to Major
Seekinge, Dr. W; Sybesma, and Mrs.McCutcheon. I don‘t believe
we have addresses for these three and would be grateful to have
them some time at your convenience. Perhaps you could indicate
What their special interests are. as I'm sure we should keep in

touch with them if they were helpful to you.

Yes, we did send a cepy of the book to everyone we could
remember who had helped. we did eend one to Harry Reneehl with
Whom we‘re in touch quite often. but I'm.sure he can use an extra

copy.
Let me‘know if you want more copies yourself. I'm enclosing
a cepy of a new leaflet we've just produced inwWhich we've quoted
you.
Best wishes for the New‘Yeer!
Sincerely.

Christine Stevens
President

Dear Jean,

It was good to hear from you, but I'm very sorry to hear you are
still in the hospital. I look forwedd to talking with you by phone
when I am in London. I hope you'll be feeling much better by then.

‘We can decide definitely when I arrive, but I should think that
the simplest thing would be to send the files as they are. ‘We have
hanging files too.

We're in the midst of a tremendous battle over the dolphins killed
in the tune nets at the moment, but hope the furbearere can have on:
attention again soon. ‘

Kindest regards and warm wishes for your speedy recovery,

Yours,

Chriétine Stevens
President

" from 11% million to 3% million since 1957" is correct (I hOpe) for
export figures. The difiiculty is that it is impossible to get the
production figures which are very much higher. The export iigures
alone do not really give anywhere near a true picture.

Dear Dr. Vinter,

MP5. Stevens asked me, before she left for COlorado,
to let you know that she thought there would be no
problem in giving permission to reproduce the illustrations
from FACTS ABOUT FURS with due acknowledgement. I

~ The Fougesse cartoon,she said permission was given '
by the Birds to use that in .Armmes m THEIR LEGAL
RIGHTS, so there should be no problem.these, either.

Trust all goes well with.you. I have sent you same

letters recently Commenting on FACTS. I should have said

I meiled one last week.' Please excuse this letter...

I am glad the endof the day is here!

Very sincerely,

Animals in Science Teaching - a directory of alternatives

 

The continued concern among teachers and students to find audio-visual
alternatives to the thug of animals in the classroom, lecture theatre
and teaching laboratory has led the Universities Federation for
Animal Welfare (UFAN) and time British Universities Filni and. Video
Council (BUFVC) to update their“ annotated <directory (n: audio-visual
alternatives.

'Animals in Science Teaching - a directory of audio-visual alter-
natives' replaces the previous directory - 'Animals iri Scientific
Research', published lTl 1983. 'Animals iri Science Teaching' lists
290 currently available titles and includes the following media
types: film, video cassette, tape-slide, audio tape, computer
simulation and interactive video.

The directory is supplemented by three essays which discuss the
legal and ethical implications of using animals in scientific research;
developments in the use of computer simulations as alternatives
to the'use of live animals, and the practicalities of using video
in teaching physiological processes.

Information on organisations concerned with the useof audio-visual
techniques in the promotion of animal welfare is also given as are
details of programme distributors who have relevant materials in
their libraries.

The directory' is specifically aimed at those ‘teachers euui students
who work with animals, however a more general audience could find
some of the items useful in providing a provocative start to a debate
on the ethics of using animals in research.

Both BUFVC and UFAN hope that lecturers and students will make full
use of the material available to them and come to regard the use-
of audio-visual material not only as a valid teaching method in

its own right but also as making a significant contribution to animal
welfare. '

Free copies are being distributed tx> appropriate teachers' resource
centres and higher education audio-visual units. Further copies
are available from UFAW, 8 Hamilton Close, South Mimms, Potters

NOTES FOR EDITORS

The Universities Federation for Animal Welfare (UFAw—pronounced You
4) founded in 1926 is a science—based educational charity concerned
‘with the welfare of all_ animals. Started in 1926 as the University
of London Animal Welfare Society, branches were combined to sform UFAw

inl938.

UFAW takes the view that animals are used, therefore their needs must

THE ANIMAL HOUSE
By W. LANE-PETTER

“The animal house is a key point, not less important, and perhaps even more
important, than the laboratory itself.” (Parkes, 1950).

There is still evidence that this key point has sometimes been added as an after-
thought, or by adaptation of existing, often unsuitable, spare accommodation. In other
places much thought and money have been expended on providing really good animal
quarters, but the variety of designs and methods of construction indicates that much has
yet to be learned about the full requirements of a ﬁrst-class animal house. This chapter
claims to do no more than introduce the main aspects of the problem. Laboratory Animals
Bureau Collected Papers, Vol. 2 (1954), contains much valuable information on the subject.

Siting

That experimental animals should be kept near the laboratories in which they are
used needs no stressing, although it is generally undesirable that they should be kept in
the laboratory. On the other hand normal stocks, and especially the breeding unit,
should be entirely separate. In no circumstances should animals ever return from the
experimental side to the normal, and the practice of lodging experimental animals under
long term observation with normal stock must be universally condemned (Paterson, 1953).

The animal house, then, should be a separate building, or a separate wing or ﬂoor
of the laboratory building. At all events it must be physically separate, and the division
marked at least by a door, preferably a double set of doors.

Sometimes the choice lies between the top floor of a many~storied building, and the
basement. The basement or ground ﬂoor simplifies the problem of receiving forage
and removing soil for disposal, but often introduces problems of ventilation and disturb-
ance. Dogs and monkeys are liable to be noisy; equally to be avoided is noise coming
into the animal house, as from vehicles passing or parked outside, or from internal trafﬁc.
The top floor is more likely to be quiet and ventilation is less of a difﬁculty, but the carting
of forage and bedding up, and of soil down, has to be considered. Soil chutes and. goods
lifts will usually have to be provided. Soil chutes are a great convenience, but care should
be taken in regard to their siting and design. It should be possible to clean them periodi-
cally, and to hose them down; they must therefore contain no ledges or irregularities.
It may be necessary to instal them outside the building.

Smell, even in a basement, should not be a serious matter, if ventilation and ordinary
hygiene are what they should be. Nuisance from ﬂies and other pests should never
occur. Where a choice is available, however, the animal house should be on the lee side
of other buildings in respect of the prevailing wind, and the animal rooms, if possible,
should face north.

2 CHAPTER 2

Design

All animal houses, whether a guinea-pig house serving a small hospital laboratory,
or that of a large reserach institute, have certain basic departments. The functional
interrelationship of these departments governs their physical relationship. In its simplest
form there are four departments:

1. For normal animals.

2. For experimental animals.

3. Clean store, for food, bedding, and cages.

4. For washing, sterilizing and incinerating.
' The relationship is best explained by a diagram (Fig. l) which shows the pattern of traﬂic.
Any elaboration of this may be reduced to subdivision of the four basic departments,
with due regard to the trafﬁc between them.

Normal Animal Department. The normal animal department may be split into two,
one for breeding certain species, and one for receiving animals obtained from other sources.
The rule for the breeding house is complete isolation and recruitment from within,qa one-
way trafﬁc of animals going out but never in (except to found new lines). The receiving
section should provide for quarantining incoming stock, and this may involve the provision
of a completely isolated subsection with its own entrance and exit, because purchased
stock is the most potent source of infection in an animal house.

As far as possible, the placing of more than one species in a single room should be
avoided; indeed, it is better to keep different strains of the same species apart and, in a
large establishment handling large numbers of the same strain, these should be spread
among a number of rooms. It follows that in every animal house a large number of small
rooms is inﬁnitely to be preferred to a small number of large ones. A further advantage
of small rooms is the greater length of wall space available for cage racks. .

Experimental Animal Department. It is equally desirable for this to be subdivided
into a number of rooms, each having a single species and, if possible, a single experiment
or group of experiments. This is particularly important in the case of experimental
infections, in order to avoid accidental cross-infection. Indeed, it is often necessary
to arrange for isolation rooms where such infectiOns are under investigation, with all the
precautions against accidental spread which are indicated by the nature of the infection.

Part of the experimental department should be set aside for the carrying out of experi-
mental procedures, such as inoculations, operations and the like. This will require the
provision of some simple laboratory facilities, and perhaps an operating theatre, and a
separate room or rooms should be set aside for this purpose. There will also have to be
. another room for post mortem examinations on animals which die from intercurrent
infections or other accidental causes, for it should be the invariable rule to ascertain the
cause of death in every case.

Washing and Sterilizing Department. Dirty cages and soiled bedding from all sources
must be removed into a wash room, for cleaning, sterilizing, and incineration of soil and
carcases. Direct access to an outside yard is very desirable. Generous provision for hot
and cold water supply, and for steam, is important. If cages are cleaned before sterilizing,
they may be passed through an autd lave or other sterilizer directly into the clean cage

 

 

 




 

.. ,j, “Mir as; ' * in‘ 1 u 1- i" v“ 000‘ L .7 u-u. -
ment; but if, as is essential in the casis of dangerous infections, cages are autoclaved with
their soil, then it will be necessary to have a separate room, or part of a large room, for
cleaning them after sterilization, before they are taken into the clean store.

Clean Stores Department. The clean stores department must be subdivided into
three main divisions, for clean cages, clean bedding and food respectively. Clean cages
are received from the sterilizer, and stored ready to go into the animal rooms. Bedding
is best stored on its own, in vermin-proof containers. It is sometimes necessary to auto-
clave all bedding before use. In such cases only sterilized bedding should be stored in a
clean store, and provision made for holding unsterilized bedding elsewhere.

Food should be stored on its own. Where only normal readymade diets are used,
a single room for food may sufﬁce but, if special diets have to be made up, a separate food
kitchen is almost essential. The food store then becomes a place for keeping bulk ingredi-
ents, which are taken as required into the kitchen.

A semi-diagrammatic layout of a small animal house is shown in ﬁg. 2.

Animal rooms should be oblong rather than square, with a door at one end and a
window, if provided, at the other. If both are centrally placed in the short ends, both
long walls are available for racking, leaving a central gangway between. In this way the
best possible utilization of space is achieved. Dimensions depend to some extent on
individual preferences and requirements, but a width of about 7-lOft. and a length of one
and a half to twice the width give a useful animal room. Service rooms will of course
be different. It is well to make a number of more or less similar animal rooms that can
be adapted for different species, for the emphasis on species of animals used may change
with changing work. '

Construction

The construction of animal houses can be carried out in a large variety of building
materials. The basic requirements are reasonable insulation against heat gain or loss;
ability to hose down walls, ceilings and floors at frequent intervals; the avoidance of different
levels, e.g., steps, for much traffic is by means of wheeled trolleys; and the exclusion of
wild vermin and insect pests.

Wood, asbestos cement and other garage type structures are quite unsuitable. Brick
cavity or insulated concrete walls are best, with brick or breeze brick party walls, and an
insulated ceiling, preferably not pitched. Walls and ceilings should be ﬁnished smooth
and hard, capable of taking a hard gloss enamel paint or other ﬁnish. A hard composition
plaster is very suitable. Alternatively, sheets of metal or plastic, glazed tiles or glazed
bricks, may be used. A wooden or rubber fender ﬁxed along all corridor walls at just
below trolley height will prevent damage to the walls from passing trolley traﬂic. Floors
must be hard and impervious to the action of water, excreta, especially urine, and dis-
infectants. They may be composed of hard bitumen or asphalt, granolithic, terrazzo or

 




UF AW HANDBOOK.—-FIVE.

other composition cement. Soft asphalt or bitumen is to be avoided on account of pitting.
Some composition cements have a marked tendency to corrode in the presence of urine,
and are unsuitable for this reason. All corners must be rounded and coved. No cracks
are to be tolerated.

Pipes and radiators should either be completely concealed or else held clear of the
walls, so that it is easy to clean behind them. The same applies to built-in cage racks,
which are best made adjustable, suspended from the ceiling or from brackets in the wall,
and held at least ten inches from the ﬂoor. Electric wiring should be buried, and all
electric ﬁttings air- and water- proof

All ventilators, windows and other openings must be proof against ﬂies and mosquitoes
by ﬁtting ﬁne gauze. Pipes going through the walls must be closely sleeved.

Doors should be plain and not panelled, self-closing, and ﬂush- ﬁtting both at the sides
and at the bottom. Not even a voung mouse must be able to squeeze underneath. In
View of the trolley trafﬁc going through them they should be light, and 1n places may need
protecting by means of metal plates. It is an advantage to have the lower half or two
thirds of the doors protected in this way.

Floors should be sloped to gullies in such a way that no water runs into the corridor
when rooms are hosed down. A central gully in each roOm is usually to be preferred
to a side or end gully, and the latter is better than one situated in a corner. Where cage
racks on castors are used, the ﬂoors will have to be ﬂat and, after being hosed down, will
have to be dried with squeegee and mop. In such cases a gully across the threshold is
a satisfactory arrangement. All gullies must be ﬁtted with gratings ﬂush with the ﬂoor,
so that trolleys and bins can be wheeled across them.

Generally speaking, whatever furnishings and plumbing are required, it must never
be forgotten that an animal house must be easy to wash down from ceiling to ﬂoor, and
inaccessible corners are above all else to be avoided.

Heating, Ventilation and Lighting

Since heating, lighting and ventilation are to a large extent mutually dependent,
it is best to consider them together.

Most animal rooms require to maintain a temperature which does not vary day or
night, winter or summer, more than 5° F. This is an ideal by no means always attained,
but it should be the aim for all new construction designed to house animals.

The most satisfactory solution of the heating and ventilating problem, and the most
expensive, is full air—conditioning. This provides a controlled input of heated, or coOled,
air of the correct relative humidity. Provided the input and exhaust ducts are properly
situated, the temperature and relative humidty can be accurately controlled within fairly
narrow limits, and adequate ventilation prOvided in all circumstances. The details of
full air conditioning are technical matters beyond the scope of this chapter, but it is
important to ensure that every part. of the animal room is equally ventilated, and that there
is a’slight negative pressure in the room. This prevents stale, possibly infected, air leaking
out of the animal rooms into other parts of the building, and is easily achieved by arranging
that the exhaust is a little faster than the input. The number of air changes per hour will
depend on local conditions and requirements, but it is likely to fall between 5 and 10,
the rate of exhaust being about one change more than the rate of input.

If full air conditioning cannot be provided, the next best thing is the delivery of air,
heated as necessary, through ducts, with some method of forced exhaust. The input
ducts may be no more than grills through which the air is sucked, passing over or through
a heating coil or radiator, by the action of exhaust fans. On the other hand, they may be
part of a plenum system delivering heated. air from a central plant. ' The exhaust system
may also be a centralized installation, but often independent fans in each room will Serve
the purpose adequately.

The siting of input and exhaust apertures-is important. In oblong rooms with cages
down either side, the input is best placed low down at one end, and the exhaust high up
at the other; 'or the relative positions may be reversed. In either case there is through
ventilation, without the formation of pockets of stagnant air in the corners.

Heating can be by steam or hot water pipes, radiators, or panels, and if a source of
steam or hot water is available nearby, this is undoubtedly the most economical and efﬁcient
method. The alternative is some form of electric space heater, either tubular heaters,
“ black- body ” panels, or convectors. All are cheap to install but costly in use; they
have the great advantage that they can be connected to a thermostat and thus give a very
satisfactory cOntrol of heating. Probably the best arrangement of all 18 to provide the basic
heating by steam or hot water which, 1f necessary, can be controlled by its own thermostat,
and to instal thermostatically controlled electric heaters to top up the heating in very "cold
weather.. This has the added advantage that dUring the summer, when the hot water
may not be available, the electric heaters are there to take care of cold spells so characteristic
of the British summer.

If it is possible to conceal the heating elements in the floor, walls or ceiling, so much
the better, because in this way is avoided the difﬁculty of cleaning round and behind pipes
and radiators. But imperfect concealment, which leaves cracks and serious unevennesses
as an invitation to cockroaches and bed bugs, is worse than no concealment at all. A new
structure should be able to incorporate completely concealed heating, but in adapted
quarters it is usually better to have hea'ters standing clear of the ﬂoor and far enough
from the walls to make it possible to 016 an behind them

 




,« '- 1 “ , " T e siting o‘ t_ermostatsrequires c'.er. If they are too near an animal cage t ey may
i ‘ be affected by the body heat of the animal. They should not be in any line of draught,
even the temporarydraught 'that occurs when the door is opened.

Open ﬁres, whether electric, gas or oil, are nbt suitable for animal rooms.

As has been indicated, ventilation may be forced, or~it may be by natural currents,
for example through louvres in the door, or at either side of it, at one end, and out of the ,
window at the other. But windows are not really necessary in animal rooms; indeed, they
quite considerably complicate the problem of temperature control. Moreover, in summer
time, unless they face north, they introduce the additional problem of direct sunshine,
which is undesirable in any animal room. As regards lighting, there is no objection, unless
it be on the triﬂing score of added expense, to artiﬁcial lighting, and in favour of this is the
arrangement, by means of a time switch, of. an all the year round cycle of illumination;
say, 12 hours on and 12 hours off. Many workers claim that partial or complete elimination
of seasonal variation of \breeding performance can be achieved by this means. (See, for

examples, Hall, 1950; Charles, 1953; Alexander and Frazer, 1952).

' As a compromise, a small window may be placed high up. If it is of frosted or pebbled
glass no direct sunshine can reach the animals. Alternatively, glass bricks transmit diffused
light, while at the same time providing good heat insulation.

Artiﬁcial lighting may be-from ﬁlament bulbs or ﬂuorescent tubes. The quality of
the light is dependent on the choice of those working in the animal house. The animals
are almost certainly responsive only to its intensity since, with the exception of monkeys,
all experimental mammals are colour blind. The only indication for ultraviolet irradiation
is as a bacteriostatic agent. '

Other Considerations

Discipline. The discipline of an animal house should in many ways resemble that of
~ a fever hospital. The possibility of cross-infection should never be far away from the minds
of those working there. Generally-speaking, the better the health of the animals, the more
danger is there of infection being conveyed to them from outside; casual visitors are a
potent means of exposing them to this danger. In certain cases it may be necessary to
equip each animal room with double doors enclosing an air-lock, and to. arrange a system
of change of outer garments, including boots, and a routine of .hand washing and even of
wearing face masks. This need not be a laborious or time-consuming procedure, and it
will certainly serve to emphasize the importance of ﬁrst class hygiene. Where dangerous
infections are being investigated, special precautions depending on the nature of the

infections, will also have to be take . _ '

But whatever arrangements are made in the lay-out of the animal house in order to
reduce the danger of intercurrent infection, none will be effective unless the animal house
staﬂ" observes a high standard of hygienic discipline, not now and then, but always. This
cannot come about unless its members are aware of the dangers and thoroughly understand
the precautions necessary to avoid them. .

Pest Control. The control of pests of the animal house is dealt with in chapter 00.
Here it is necessary only to add that nothing short of absolute freedom from bugs, roaches,
ﬂeas, lice, mites and other pests should be tolerated. Even ﬂies, mosquitoes and other
winged pests should ﬁnd in the animal house an environment incompatible with their
survival. Vertebrate pests, such as rats, mice and birds must be excluded at all times.
Tame cats, even as an anti-rodent measure, are not permissible, for they are alternative
hosts of several helminth infestations of laboratory animals, and may be casual vectors of
other infections, either directly, or through food and bedding materials.

Equipment. This is dealt with in chapter 00.

Amphibians

 

Frogs and toads
These animals can. be satisfactorily anaesthetised before killing, thus:
Into a beaker put 1% or 2% urethane solution to a depth of about one inch.
(To make a 1‘75 solution add 1 dessertspoonful of urethane to 1 pint of warm water).
Put the frog into the solution and-see that its head. is just above the surface.
Cover the beaker as this solution is volatile and leave for about 5 minutes.
Alternatively, place the frog in a. dessdcator over a piece of cotton wool soaked
in ether or chloroform. This arrangement keeps the liquid anaesthetic from
touching the animals. '
Decapitation is humane if done by (1) a sharp instrument (2) by an experienced

Operator.

Pithing .
(a) Wrap a duster around the frog leaving only the head exposed.

Hold the animal in one hand: take a strong, sharp scissors, and place the lower
blade across. the mouth, over the tongue as far back as possible. With a rapid
stroke, cut the head off behind the eyes, leaving the lower jaw intact; this
removes the fore brain. It will be found that the cranial cavity is then
clearly visible. Immediately destroy the posterior brain by thrusting a straigh
seeker into the bavity and stirring it round. If necessary, the spinal cord
can subsequently be destroyed by pushing, the seeker on down the middle of the
spinal column.

(b) Wrap a duster round the frog leaving only the head exposed.
Hold the animal in one hand: bend the neck forward by putting the forefinger of
the free hand over the nose. With a semi-sharp seeker feel for the gap at the
back of the skull where it joins the vertebral column. Make a quick, sharp
downward jab at this point in the mid line through the skin and immediately turn
the needle forward to stir up the brain and destroy it completely. If the cord
is to be destroyed, remove the animal from the duster and pass the seeker through
the same hole backwards down inside the spinal column.

(c) To pith the South African clawed toad (Xenopus laevis), the
head of which cannot be bent forward, thrust a blunt straight seeker into the
cranium through one of the nostrils. 'Destroy the brain and drive the seeker

through the foramen magnum dovm to the urostyle.

Drowning for Dissection. ,,

The less the oxygen in the water and the higher the
temperature, the quicker the drowning, the1etore: ——use boiled
water, warm but not hot enough to spoil the specimens; use the
minimum amount of water necessary for the required number of
animals; and exclude all air, either by using a corked tube completely l
, ﬁlled with water, Or by covering the surface of the water with oil. '

XVIII. EARTHWORMS

Leave them alone if possible, otherwise kill them by crushing
c0mpletely or by dropping them into fast—boiling water when they
die immediately.

For Dissection. ~
Place in a desiccator over a piece of cotton wool soaked in
chloroform. This arrangement keeps the anaesthetic from touching
the epidermis.

XVII. SLUGS AND SNAILS

In small numbers, kill slugs. and snails by crushing completely.
In large numbers, collect them in an earthenware container and
pour on fast-boiling water. Water keeps its heat better in glazed

earthenware than in a bucket, so that there is less danger Of scalding

without killing if earthenware is used. It is not humane to put these ‘
creatures into salt water.

To kill an.animal humanely means that the animal must suffer neither
physical pain nor fear. This is the least that can be done for animals
whose lives are being taken for human benefit. It is important and
worthwhile for you to develOp the skill and understanding that is needed.
Animals to be killed should be handled gently, not roughly.

The best way to kill animals is by an overdose of anesthetic. The
amount of anesthetic necessary depends on the kind of anesthetic, the kind
and size and age of the animal, and, in the case of an anesthetic breathed
by the animal, the amount of space inside the enclosure. Following are
some of the most commonly used methods:-

(a) Injection of barbiturates (nembutal, phenobarbital, pentobarbital
etc

(1) Into a vein (intravenously) for large animals.
(2) Into the chest cavity (intra-thoracic injection) or the peritoneal
cavity (part of the abdomen) for small or large animals.

(b) Inhalation (chloroform, coal gas, etc.) By placing the animal and
a suitable amount of the anesthetic in an enclosed space (a box,
a bell-jar, a desiccator, a specially built chamber), it will
breathe the anesthetic and become unconscious.

In learning how to kill animals by any method:~

E1) Have someone who is skillful and humane carefully show you how;
2) Practice on dead animals until you are sure you would not
frighten, hurt, or only half kill and live animal.

(3) Be sure you have all the necessary equipment and that it is in
good order (hypodermic needles should be sharp).

(h)'When using chloroform, animals should be placed to one side of,
get on tOp of, Cloth wet with anesthetic. A good plan with small
animals is to place them on.a wire-mesh grid in the chamber or
box. This provides them with a foothold and prevents their
coming in contact with the wet chloroform.

(5) Observe animals going under anesthetic to be sure they are becoming
unconscious, ggt_struggling, and net remaining wide awake. (They
may, however, sway or stagger. After they have collapsed they
may make peculiar noises or movements).

(6) Certain methods require a good deal of skill, nerve, or strength.
Never use methods that you cannot carry our successfully, Sub-
stitute another humane method instead.

( (7) Be sure the animal is dead before you dispose of the body. You can
be sure the animal is dead if it is stiff, cold and motionless.
