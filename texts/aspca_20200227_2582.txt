and canaries bird seed in sealed containers
can be stored easily.

When it comes to sanitation, cats are no
problem. A. sand or newspaper-ﬁlled pan can
be emptied into a covered septic container.
Dogs too many be taught to use a box.

Medical supplies should include an anti-
septic, gauze bandage, adhesive tape, absor-
bent cotton and soap. Also include a seda-
tive, for animals may panic and become
hard to handle. Consult your veterinarian on
the proper dosage. Aspirin should be on
hand to ease light pain or fear. Cats and
small dogs can be given a quarter tablet,
dogs of 25 pounds a half tablet and a St.
Bernard a whole tablet.

To administer a pill hold the animal’s
upper jaw with your left hand, palm down
and force the jaws open. With your right
hand pop the pill in the back of the mouth
and close the jaws. Stroke the throat down-
ward to stimulate swallowing.

Handling frightened animals

To restrain a frightened animal wrap
him in a coat or blanket or a sack. An im-
provised restraining muzzle can be made
from gauze bandage. Slip 3 loop over the
dog’s jaws with the knot up, tighten, then
bring the loose ends down under the lower
jaw and secure in back of the neck. Follow
regular ﬁrst aid procedure for burns, bleed-
ing and fractures.

If the animal was exposed to the same
amount of radiation you were, scrub its
body with warm water and mild soap. Ac-
cording to a Department of Defense pam-
phlet, “Fallout Protection, What to Know
and Do About Nuclear Attack,” symptoms
of radiation sickness are nausea, lack of ap-
petite, fatigue and vomiting. In severe cases
the symptoms may disappear in three days,
but recur after a week or more. Fever,
mouth soreness and diarrhea may appear;
gums and mouth may ulcerate and bleed;
and about the third week, the hair may

“Caring for our pets in the tragic
event of a nuclear attack would be one
of the many difﬁcult problems to be
faced. Inevitably, providing such care
would complicate survival problems for
most families. The affection that
owners have for their animals would
compound the problem.

“As stated in your article, ‘No de-
ﬁnitive solution has been reached.’ I
very much regret that we are confronted
by this problem and I wish you every
success in your studies to arrive at a
solution which will be kind to our dumb
animal friends withOut jeopardizing the
chances of humans to survive.”

start to fall out. When exposure has been
overwhelming, animals and humans may
die in a matter of hours or linger on for
several weeks.

Treatment involves general rest, aspirin
for headache and motion-sickness tablets for
nausea. Give liquids when vomiting has
stopped. The ideal liquid is one "teaspoon
of table salt to one quart of cool water.

The pamphlet offers this advice on farm
animals. As much livestock as possible
should be placed in barns. Afterward, any
livestock exposed to fallout should be
washed or brushed to remove fallout par-
ticles. Water from wells and streams would
be safe for animal use, and hogs and steers
could be kept alive even with water and
feed containing fallout particles. If no other
food is available livestock could be turned
out to pasture after a few days when radio-
activity has decreased.

Farm animals must be saved for the na-
tion’s food supply. Naturally, most pet owners
feel their pets are worth saving too. For more
than 15 months a committee from the ASPCA
has been combing all available information
seeking answers 'to the pressing problem of
what to do with pets during a nuclear at-
tack. No deﬁnitive solution has been reached,
but we are continuing our research in the
hope that a way will be found to save our
animal friends.

Robert B. Ferris (left), retiring Queens Dis-
trict Manager, gives some tips to his successor
George H. Tuscher.

Tuscher succeeds Ferris
as Queens Manager

George H. Tuscher, former Supervisor
of Humane Work, succeeds Robert B.
Ferris, who retired after 32 years as
Queens District Manager.

Mr. Tuscher joined the Society in
1947 as a clerk Whose duties included
receiving and recording complaints of
cruelty. In 1952 he was made head of
the department, in charge of inspections
and investigations of cruelty.

Mr. Ferris retired from the post he
held since the ASPCA shelter in Jamaica
was three months old. He started as a
license inspector in 1929. Six months
later he became District Manager of the
shelter. He saw the animal haven grow
from a little cow shed to four buildings
—~ a 100-year-old farm house serving as
an adoption center, a modern red brick
shelter for lost and stray animals, a
garage for eight ambulances, and a
charming ofﬁce building that looks like
a homey roadside restaurant.

Free examination
for adopted pets
Animals adopted from the ASPCA

now have one week to take advantage
of a free examination in the Society’s
Hospital, instead of two weeks previous-
ly allowed.

Dr. John E. Whitehead, Director of
the Hospital and Clinic, explained the
reason for the change. “Our aim is to
make sure that only healthy animals are
given out for adoption. We have always
urged that sick animals be returned to
the shelter. But many families waited
until the last day to have their pets
examined. By that time a disease some-
times was so advanced treatment was
of little help and the family was so
attached to the pet it was reluctant to
give it up.”

Ideally, a new pet should be examined
by a veterinarian before it enters the
owner’s home —— on the day of adoption.
If this is impossible, it should be exam-
ined the following day. We are allowing
one week only to help owners who can’t
do it in 48 hours.

The animal will still be entitled to one
temporary free inoculation against com-
municable disease, if recommended by
the veterinarian, and the owner will be
given advice on care.

If it is not convenient to bring the
pet to the ASPCA Hospital, we strongly
recommend a Visit, at the owner’s ex-
pense, to a veterinarian of his choice.

“Under no circumstances should a
medical examination be postponed or
neglected,” warned Dr. Whitehead.

Dogs and Psychiatry
( Continued from page 6)

' A dog supplies love when a child needs
to love safely, without fear of losing the
loved object, and without losing face.

° A dog can provide a close, cuddly,
affectionate, non-judgmental relationship,
when a child craves this type of relation-
ship.

° Dogs can’t talk back when a child yells
at them.

' N0 human being can offer more gen-
eral acceptance to the child in its fullest
meaning than the faithful dog for whom
the master can do no wrong.

' In relation to the dog, the child goes
through the enriching experience of gaining
complete mutual acceptance.

In Dr. Levinson’s opinion, a greater un-
derstanding of the child’s need for cuddling,
love and affection, whether by animals or
human beings, would lead to more rapid
recovery in many disturbed children. “Dis-
turbed children,” he adds, “do not want to
be judged. They want to be accepted, ad-
mired and permited to regress as far as
possible, without their loved object berating
them and creating a feeling of guilt.”

A child who might shy from human con-
tact, despite sugary words, may react very
well to animals, and love them and relate to
them, Dr. Levinson believes. “In fact,” he
says, “the animal may trigger in the dis-
turbed, self-centered child, the ﬁrst break-
through of concern for something outside
of himself.”

“Once this door is wedged open, the
emergence of a socially-oriented person, able
to maintain himself in the world, beyond
the dark, narrow wall of self, becomes both
possible and probable.”

ln suggesting the canine counseling corps
for children, Dr. Levinson cites the use of
dogs for wartime service. “A dog corps
served this country heroically during World
War II in the performance of military tasks.

Why can’t they serve as psychotherapeutie
aides?”

 




 

 

 

Both cats need a food
formulated just for cats

While one cat prefers fish and the other pre-
fers meat, both are cats. And whether a cat
is a show cat or a household pet, it needs
the basic nutrients in quantities different from
those required by other animals. That’s why a
cat needs a food specially formulated for cats.
What formulation is most desirable for cats?

It needs more protein for strong tissue,
growth and maintenance. It needs calcium
and phosphorous for sturdy

bones and teeth; essential

CATS AS PETS

In the market
for an intelligent
affectionate
clean

self-reliant pet
A cat could

be for you.

The time comes in every family’s life
when the children clamor for a pet. You
haven’t the energy or the inclination to walk
a dog. Fish or turtles leave you cold. Your
city apartment leaxes no room for a rabbit
hutch. Birds seem too impersonal. What’s
left?

From a practical tandpoinli, a cat is an
ideal pet for city, suburbs or country since
he thrives under widely different climates
and circumstances. Under feline assets check
intelligence, adaptability, affection, cleanli-
ne s and self-reliance.

Paradoxically, a cat can take excellent
care of himself, but you’ve also got to be
one jump ahead of a cat to prevent him from
falling out the window, locking himself in a
closet or snooping into an open paint can.
Curiosity is another ingrained feline trait.

MBASSADORS in striped pants are get-
A ting an assist these days from four-footed
diplomats in striped coats, shaggy coats and
spotted coats. Animals ranging from butter-
ﬂies to bisons, and lizards to leopards are
stampeding into international relations as
gifts from one country to another.

Take Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy’s recent
tour of India and Pakistan. India presented
her with two tiger cubs and Pakistan gave
her a thoroughbred horse named Sardar
(Chief). The cubs will go to a zoo, but the
First Lady, an avid horsewoman, announced
she would keep the bay gelding. Delighted
with the gift, Mrs. Kennedy said, “No one
is going to be allowed to ride him but me.”

When Sardar joins the White House
menagerie he’ll ﬁnd another animal gift—
a fluffy White puppy presented to the presi-
dential family by Soviet Premier Khrushchev
last year as a reminder of Soviet space
achievements. Pushinka’s mother was Strelka,
the dog shot into orbit by the Russians.

Khrushchev and Kennedy’s predecessor
disagreed on such issues as disarmament,
but they saw eye to eye on cows, and ani-
mal diplomacy boomed during the Eisen-
hower administration.

During Khrushchev’s visit to the United
States Eisenhower presented him with a
prize Aberdeen heifer from his Gettysburg
farm. Khrushchev exchanged animal gifts
with American industrialist Cyrus S. Eaton.
Eaton sent the Russian cattle, and Khrush-
chev reciprocated with a $6,000 dapple-gray
Orloff stallion. Vice-President Nixon’s gift
to Khrushchev was a shipment of quail
which the Premier served at a country din-
ner for American Ambassador Llewellyn
Thompson and his family.

Elephants are among the most popular
goodwill gifts, and elephant trading among
potentates goes back centuries. Even a rajah
who had everything would look twice at a
white elephant.

Incidentally, that’s how the phrase “white
elephant” came to mean what it does today.
In the Malay Peninsula a white elephant is

sacred and eculd not be put to work or dis-
creetly lost. But he still had an elephant-
sized appetite, and the most diplomatic way
to bankrupt an enemy was to send him a
white elephant and let the pachyderm eat
him out of house and home.

Presumably elephants are not given with
the same ulterior motive today. In 1950
Prime Minister Nehru sent a pair of ele-
phants from India to United States children.
The French Community in Africa sent
Eisenhower a 400-pound baby elephant
named Zimbo.

During the Truman administration the
offer of an elephant caused a minor diplo-
matic crisis. The Kingdom of Cambodia was
sending its ﬁrst minister to the United States
and the King wanted to open diplomatic rela-
ions by offering the president an elephant.
Mr. Truman had no place to keep an ele-
phant and the Washington Zoo, which gets
most animal gifts to American presidents,
already had enough elephants. The U. S.
suggested politely it might be better for
Cambodia to send a tiger because the zoo
was short of tigers.

Nevertheless, the King of Cambodia went
ahead with his offer and shipped the gift
elephant. Diplomatic ofﬁcials privately sighed
in relief when the elephant died at sea.

President Lincoln once dealt with a simi-
lar embarrassing elephant problem by turn-
ing down the gift. It was during the Civil
War when the King of Siam offered to
donate some elephants to the Union Army.
Lincoln said, “No thanks.” In a letter to the
King, he wrote, “Our political jurisdiction
does not reach a latitude so low as to favor
the multiplication of the elephant.”

Some animal diplomacy is on the people-
to-people level. Aminadov Glanz, a Brooklyn
butterﬂy dealer, exchanged butterﬂies with
Sergei Khrushchev, son of the Premier, who
had visited Glanz during his father’s United
States tour. For St. Patrick’s Day a few
years ago the National Zoological Park in
Wrashington sent snakes to the Dublin Zoo

BLUEPRINT

FOR SUCCESS

Elsworth S. Howell has improved on the
formula for a successful career by combin-
ing two seemingly antagonistic interests—
animals and books. A successful publisher
of educational books for nearly 30 years,
while managing a lifelong hobby as dog
breeder, exhibitor and judge, he has ef-
fected a marriage of the two pursuits to

produce the biggest line anywhere of books
on animals.

“I was born into a dog-loving family,”
said the president of Howell Book House,
Inc. in his plush office on the twentieth
floor of a New York skyscraper. He’s a slim,
soft-spoken, six-footer with a warm hand-
shake. Studying the magniﬁcent View of the
United Nations, he added, “As a child I
owned the full gamut of pets. I had a pony
named Lucky Strike. I bred and sold rab-
bits, had cockatoos and cardinals and even
went through the hamster stage.”

This experience with pets, plus his exten-

sive publishing background, was all the en-
couragement he needed to acquire a com-
pany specializing in animal books when it
was put up for sale two years ago.

Today his ofﬁce is lined with volumes
entitled The Complete Airedale, The Corn-
plete Beagle, and down. the alphabet of
breeds to The Complete W est Highland White
Terrier. Besides the “Complete” series, the
Howell line includes books on breeding, care.
training and grooming of dogs. Other ani-
mals are covered too in the The Complete
Cat, Complete Book of Tropical Fish, Your
Canary, Parakeets. and Parrots, Cochatoos
and Macaws.

In the works now is Dog Training for
Boys and Girls by Blanche Saunders, the
world’s outstanding obedience training au-
thority. “The book will have over 100 illus—
trations and any child over eight will be
able to train his own dog.”

INFECTIOUS FELINE
PANLEUCOPENIA

by the Veterinary Staff
ASPCA Hospital and Clinic

Infectious feline panleucopenia, the dread
disease of ca'tdom, is so highly contagious,
it may spread through a community killing
up to 90 percent of the susceptible untreated
cats. Young kittens are particularly suscept-
ible and some of them will die within 48
hours. Others may linger on from a few
days to two or three weeks.

How it spreads

Infectious feline panleucopenia is caused
by a virus. The disease is also known as
feline enteritis, agranulocytosis, and cat
plague, and is sometimes erroneously called
distemper. It infects only cats and does not
infect man or other animals outside the cat
family.

The virus which causes the disease will
live for about a week on bedding, clothing
and utensils. A healthy cat can contract the
disease merely by entering infected premises.
Direct contact with infected animals can
spread the disease through the virus carried
in body secretions, such as eye and nasal
discharge, vomitus, urine and blood. Lice,
ﬂeas and other blood-sucking parasites can
also transmit the disease.

Symptoms

Symptoms for this nearly-always fatal dis-
ease are sudden high temperature, dehydra-
tion, emaciation, listlessness and depression.
The sick cat wants to be alone. It refuses
food and lies ﬂat on its abdomen, its head

 

on the floor in a “frog” position. The coat
is matted and vomiting or diarrhea may oc-
cur. The temperature may reach 107 de-
grees Farenheit.

A veterinarian can usually diagnose the
disease by a white blood cell count. The
virus attacks the White cells of the blood,
destroying about 4,000 white cells a day.
Therefore, a blood count showing a loss of
white cells and other changes is an im-
portant diagnostic aid.

Treatment

Despite the high mortality rate and con-
tagious nature of the disease, there are
methods of treatment and prevention. If
treatment is started early enough, newer
antibiotics made available within the past
few years can help cut the mortality rate to
50 percent.

During the disease the cat’s intestinal tract
is inﬂamed and only small amounts of food
can be absorbed. The cat will usually refuse
to eat. It empties its digestive tract by vom-
iting and diarrhea. The veterinarian will
keep up the animal’s nutrition by fluid
therapy—— intravenous feeding, sub-cutane-
ous feeding and blood transfusions. Not until
the cat is far along the road to recovery will
the inﬂammation of the digestive tract sub-
side. In most cases food should not be of-
fered until then.

Prevention

The best attack against this feline scourge
is prevention. Veterinary medicine has de-
veloped a preventive vaccine. As soon as a
kitten is weaned, it should be inoculated.

Once a cat has reached three years, its
chances of getting the disease are remark-
ably low ——— provided it has been in contact
with other cats and has had an opportunity
to become exposed to the disease. An indoor
cat not allowed contact with other cats can-
not be considered immune and a booster in-
oculation is recommended for such animals.

If a cat contracts the disease and recovers,
it has natural immunity for the rest of its

life.

 




 

Anti-cruelty program to be expanded

Recognizing the prime importance of
its anti-cruelty and investigatory pro-
grams, the ASPCA is increasing the
scope of the Humane Work Division,
which handles these activities.

Colonel Edmond M. Rowan, who has
retired as Commanding Ofﬁcer of Fort
Wadsworth, has been named to head the
enlarged department as Director of Hu—
mane Work.

Helen E. Hoey, formerly Assistant to
the Brooklyn District Manager, has been
named Assistant to the Director.

In addition, William Ryan, Special
Agent No. 1, who in July will round out
50 years of continuous service to the
ASPCA, will serve as Inspector and
Training Instructor in the new depart-
ment, with particular attention to new

members of the Humane Work staff.

The roster of uniformed Special Agents
will be brought up to 13 or 14 when
several vacancies are ﬁlled and addi-
tional agents are hired.

Col. Rowan, a West Point graduate
and holder of many decorations for his
distinguished war service, including the
Bronze Star, Legion of Merit and Croix
de Guerre, joins our executive family
with stature equivalent to that of four
other directors appointed in 1960, when
other departments were reorganized.

They are Arthur L. Amundsen, Direc-
tor of Operations; Dr. John E. White-
head, Director of Hospital and Clinic;
June Eliot, Director of Public Relations,
Fund Raising and Humane Education;
and Thomas A. Fegan, Comptroller.

Hospital’s
pathology
laboratory
completed

The Hospital’s $50,000 expansion pro-
gram has been completed with the
opening of a new Pathology Laboratory
with complete facilities for tissue pathol-
ogy, as well as clinical pathology.

This means, for example, that the
pathologist will be able to examine dis-
eased tissue to determine whether a
tumor is benign or cancerous. While an
animal is on the operating table, a deci-
sion to remove the tumor can be made
in minutes. Too, if any animal dies
mysteriously, a post mortem examination
in the adjoining autopsy room may de-
termine the cause of death. Knowing the
cause may help ﬁnd a cure which will
help future generations of animals.

The pathologist’s report will be corre-
lated with studies from human hospitals
in a cooperative effort to free both man
and animals from disease.

The new laboratory will also analyze
specimens submitted by outside veter-
inarians on a fee basis.

A highly-trained tissue pathology
technician has been added to the staff,
which previously included a clinical
pathology technician. Both work under
a veterinarian specializing in pathology.

The 20-foot by 17-foot laboratory has
gray metal cabinets tOpped with black
stone work counters, offset by pale green
walls and a light gray tile ﬂoor. Diag-
nostic equipment includes a binocular
microscope (two eyes can be used to
look into it) with a camera attachment
for photographing slides. A plaque on

About Poodles
(Continued from page 15)

black or brown dog with white muzzle and
feet. Later the mixture beCame taboo and
about 75 years ago solid colors became fash-
ionable.”

But Pulaski still admires the particolor
and has been shouting its praises for over
20 years, “Very often the best dog in the
litter as to conformation, temperament, bold-
ness and coat is the particolor,” he says,
“and the sad thing is that in many circles
they are being destroyed at birth. If you
project this insanity into human breeding,
someone could decide to destroy all babies
born blonde, or brunette or redhead just
because he didn’t like the color.”

The Count is proudest of all, perhaps, of
his “phantom”, poodle—his own terminol-
ogy. A phantom is a grey, black or brown
poodle with symmetrical white markings on
brows, chest, tail, etc., in the same places
as the tan markings that appear on the
Dobermann pinscher. (Before he got in-
terested in toy poodles Pulaski bred Dober-
manns, a breed he still admires.)

He lists millionaires and ﬁlm stars who
have fallen for the charms of the phantom.
His clients included such peOple as Robert
W. Sarnoff, Hattie Carnegie, Vincent Astor,
Ilka Chase, Clare Booth Luce, Bob and Dan
Topping, Judy Garland, Greer Carson and
Charles Bickford. A St. Louis beauty salon
owner once paid $2,000 for a Pulaski poodle.
One of Pulaski’s current favorites is his own
pet, Pulaski-Caesar’s Phantom Johnny, who
gets $25 an hour in modeling fees and $350
in stud fees.

The most valuable poodle ever bred was
his Int. Ch. Pulaski’s Masterpiece, C.D.,
C.D.X. and U.D. (The titles mean that he
was an International Champion and that he
passed stiff obedience trials for the degrees
of Companion Dog, Companion Dog Excel-
lent and Utility Dog.) Aly Khan once of-
fered $25,000 for Masterpiece when the tiny
silver toy was being shown in Deauville,
France, but Pulaski turned him down. Mas-

36

terpiece used to earn $11,000 a year in
stud and modeling fees.

Except for movie star dogs like Lassie and
RinTinTin, Masterpiece was perhaps the
most publicized dog in history. He appeared
many times in newsreels, television, maga-
zines and newspapers. The poodle haircut
for women, so chic in the early 1950’s, was
modeled after him.

Then at the height of his career in 1953
Masterpiece was dognapped fom the fash-
ionable grooming parlor Poodles, Inc., which
the Count formerly operated. The case was
a major news event in New York and police
sent out an eleven-state alarm. The mystery
of the dognapping was never solved and
Masterpiece was never seen again.

The word poodle comes from the German
word pudel —— meaning puddle, an apt name
because the original poodle, an excellent
swimmer, was used to retrieve water fowl.
But it is a rare poodle in the Uni-ted States
that works at his ancestral trade. As a mat-
ter of fact, the present-day show clip, with
the long front coat, was originally designed
to protect the dog’s lungs in cold water.
Legs and back were shaved to enable the
dog to paddle swiftly through the water.

Although the poodle’s homeland is prob-
ably Germany, it has become the French
national dog, occupying an honorable posi-
tion on the ﬁeld of battle, in the home and
in court circles. Poodles served with Napo-
leon. Moustache, a native of Normandy,
fought valiantly with a regiment of Grena-
diers and at Austerlitz rescued the fallen
regimental colors. A born showman and
clown, the poodle has been the stage and
circus dog of Europe for hundreds of years.

Pulaski attributes the poodle’s current
popularity to its willingness to please and
its adaptability to small apartments. “The
dog is easily trained, patient with children,
devoted to home, does not shed all over the
house, has no doggy odor, is not destructive
and never looks for a fight.”

Says Pulaski, “The poodle is an adorable
fool.” And that’s high praise from a man
who lost his heart to poodles 35 years ago.

 

 




Biology textbooks

Two years ago we ran an editorial attack-
ing the spreading practice of experimenta-
tion on live animals in public high schools.
We wrote: “These experiments are worth-
less cruelties that add nothing to scientiﬁc
knowledge, as do some experiments by scien-
tists who know what they are looking for.”

Now we deplore an even worse situation
—school textbooks which suggest “study
aids” containing research projects for chil-
dren to do at home. Chapters touching on
biology propose non-classroom experiments
on live animals by the student. One textbook
recommends creating vitamin deﬁciencies in
pigeons and rats and catching live frogs
and insects for dissection.

These “study aids” encourage children
to perform experiments without even the
minimum of supervision they might receive
in the classroom. Moreover, the book fails
to mention that experiments causing pain
or death should be performed only when
necessary and then only under humane con-
ditions. A homework problem in one text-
book reads:

“To study the brain, you will have to cut
away the skin of the head and chip off the
soft bone covering the brain with your
forceps. Be patient. If you need to stop your
dissection and hold the frog for some other
hour of work be certain to wrap the pre-
served frog in several layers of wet paper.
Live frogs which have been anesthetized
may be preserved in 70% alcohol, or kept

in a refrigerator overnight.” '

Examine your child’s textbooks. If this
sort of “homework” is recommended, com-
plain .to school authorities.

These uncontrolled experiments can re-
sult only in needless torture. Instead of
teaching children reverence for life, they in-
still the attitude that life is worth so little
it can be destroyed merely for an hour of
curious probing.

OU’VE heard the old saw about the

dog who couldn’t be psychoanalyzed
because he wasn’t allowed on the couch. Well,
the tables have been turned and a dog may
soon be sitting in the psychiatrist’s chair.

A prominent psychiatrist has suggested a
well-trained canine counseling corps as a
psychotherapeutic aid for disturbed chil-
dren. He predicts that some day doctors may
prescribe pets of a certain type for different
emotional disorders.

According to Dr. Boris Levinson, director
of the psychological center of Yeshiva Uni-
versity’s Graduate School of Education, the
dog is a “companion, scapegoat, mirror,
trustee, servant, friend, admirer, conﬁdante,
toy, teammate, slave, and defender of chil-
dren.” Particularly with children, he notes,
dogs not only supply close, cuddly affection,
but they don’t talk back when a child yells
at them. What human, he asks, can offer a
child more acceptance than the faithful dog,
for whom the master can do no wrong?

Dr. Levinson learned of the dog’s psycho-
logical value to humans by accident. His pet
dog Jingles put him on the track to his new
theory. The pup aided the psychiatrist in
helping a withdrawn child — who didn’t
like, and didn’t want, to mix with people, as
most other children do.

One day Dr. Levinson had an appoint-

Psychiatrist ﬁnds
dogs possess hidden psychological value to humans

ment with his patient. When the child
entered, the doctor was busy writing at his
desk, and Jingles was dozing at his master’s
feet. Before the doctor had a chance to stop
his work, the child and the dog started play-
ing together, striking up what seemed to be
a fast friendship.

“Much to my surprise,” Dr. Levinson re-
ports in Mental Hygiene, journal of the
National Association for Mental Health, “the
child showed no fright, but instead cuddled
up to the dog and began to pet him.” As
the Visits continued, the child — in his mind
—— came to the psychiatrist’s oﬂice primarily
to play with the dog. But, as time wore on,
the doctor was included in the play sessions
more and more. Through the dog, Dr. Levin-
son was able to establish communication
with a highly disturbed patient who had
resisted other forms of therapy.

“We came slowly to the establishment
of a good working relationship, and to the
eventual rehabilitation of this young boy,”
Dr. Levinson reports. “Since then I have
used Jingles very selectively with certain
child patients.”

As a result of his continued use of the
dog, Dr. Levinson reports the following in
connection with a dog and the psychological

needs of a child:

Blueprint for Success
(Continued from page 9)

Another new book is The Koehler Method
of Dog Training by the trainer of Asta,
the fox terrier in “The Thin Man,” Roy
Rogers’ Bullet, and the Irish setter in Walt
Disney’s “Big Red.”

Recalling his childhood experiences with
his pony Lucky Strike, Mr. Howell said,
“We have a big gap in the horse ﬁeld, and
I hope to do something about that soon.”
Then he added wistfully, “I’d love to have a
horse again.”

There’s no horse—for the moment——
on his commuter’s paradise in Connecticut,
but there are plenty of dogs. He breeds
English setters and has seven of them, in-
cluding ﬁve champions, and a basset hound
named Judy. “We rotate the setters so that
every night one of them comes upstairs and
gets the advantage of life as a house pet.
Judy is always upstairs because my daugh-
ter insists on it.”

Dog show iudge

Since 1938 Mr. Howell has had a license
to judge schipperkes, the breed his father
started raising in 1925. “Too bad they’re
not more popular. They’re a smart little
dog, but inclined to be noisy and yappy.”

He helped around the kennel and at
shows and by the time he was sixteen had
won a best in breed ribbon.

In addition to judging schipperkes, he
also judges most of the sporting breeds~
cocker spaniels, springer spaniels, water
spaniels, etc. He has judged four times at
the Westminster Kennel Club Show in Mad-
ison Square Garden, the world series of
dog shows. At various times he’s been dele-
gate, secretary and president of the English
Setter Association of America, and writes a
column in Popular Dogs magazine.

He’s particularly proud of the record
chalked up by his own English setter Rock
Falls Racket, winner of more than 75
awards, including five bests in show and 50

bests of breed. Before Racket died three

10

years ago he had sired 29 champions.

Mr. Howell got into publishing in 1934
as assistant to the editor of the Book of
Knowledge, a project of Grolier, educational
book publishers. In 1939 he set up the ﬁrm’s
ﬁrst mail order department, known as
Grolier Enterprises and is now its president.

T W0 years ago another publisher, familiar
with his extensive background with dogs,
asked him to act as consultant for the
Denlinger books, which it planned to ac-
quire. Milo Denlinger, a breeder, exhibitor
and dog columnist had founded his own
publishing business in 1944 and became
world-famous for the “Complete” line of
breed books. When Denlinger died in 1957,
the business was put up for sale. When the
deal for the purchase fell through, Mr.
Howell’s train of thought went something
like this. “I’m a publisher; I know animals.
What better combination for taking over the
line myself?”

The result is Howell Book House, Inc.,
which Mr. Howell runs as an independent
company while still carrying on his Crolier
work. When he took over the Denlinger line
in 1961 it had 55 titles. He’s added six in
the past year, has about seven more under
wraps, and plans to revise others next year.

Discussing his attitude toward animals,
Mr. Howell said, “I like animals, but I’m
not a bleeding heart about them. They have
their place, but shouldn’t become a public
nuisance. No dog should be allowed to roam
the neighborhood —— a nuisance to neighbors
and a peril to itself. Sooner or later it will
be run. over. Before I sell a dog I ask
whether it will be fenced, in——not leashed
because that’s demeaning to a dog, but
fenced in.”

His pet beef is parents who unthinkingly
buy a puppy for a child before teaching the
child how to treat the animal. “The child
squeezes and pulls the tail and the dog au-
tomatically tries to retaliate.”

He thinks schools should devote four les-
sons a month to teaching children to handle
their dogs. “The kids will love it.”




In announcing the reorganization, the
Board of Managers pointed up the fact
that humane work is one of the corner-
stones of the ASPCA. Preventing cru-
elty has always been one of our primary
objectives, and with these changes we
hope to place even more emphasis on
this Vital phase of our work.

ASPCA Special Agents now investi-
gate cruelty cases and prosecute extreme
cases in court. They inspect pet shops,
stables, rodeos, circuses and other places
where animals are kept in numbers.

Board of Managers elects two members

Two men prominent in animal circles
have been elected to the Board of Man-
agers. They are Walter B. Devereux,
former president of the National Horse
Show Association, and Robert Van
Cleef Lindsay, a member of the West-
minster Kennel Club.

Mr. Devereux is chairman of the ex-
ecutive committee of the National Horse
Show Association and vice-president of
the American Horse Shows Association
and the United States Equestrian Team.
He is United States delegate to the
Federation Equestre International. .An
active polo player until recently, he
played with the Princeton polo team
during his undergraduate days.

Mr. Lindsay is a member of the
Westminster Kennel Club’s Board of
Governors and Show Committee. He is
president of the Long Island Kennel
Club, of which Mrs. Lindsay is bench

show chairman. He is delegate to the

American Kennel Club from the Amer-
ican Bloodhound Club. He and Mrs.
Lindsay breed basset hounds and blood-
hounds in Cold Spring Harbor under
the name Line Tree Kennels.

Animals for Diplomacy

(Continued from page 5)

in Ireland, traditionaly free of snakes since
St. Patrick banished them 1,500 years ago.

A few weeks ago the Montreal Children’s
Zoo presented two black Australian swans to
the Central Park Children’s Zoo in New York.

A church sponsored group named Heifer
Project regularly sends cows, goats, chickens
and hogs collected from U. S. farmers to
needy countries abroad. A goat association
once sent 15 goats to Dr. Albert Schweitzer
at his hospital in Lambarene, Africa.

One of the touchiest incidents of animal
diplomacy came up when the Nepal gov-
ernment announced it was sending two
Himalayan mastiffs to President Eisenhower.
Puzzled diplomats looking into the story dis-
covered that an eX-Eisenhower aide had re-
quested the dogs for himself. He had in
mind friendly lap-type Tibetan terriers and
wrote to the U. S. Ambassador to India.
Since Tibet was under Chinese Communist
control the Ambassador got in touch with
ofﬁcials of the Nepalese government and
said he wanted the dogs for the aide and
would pay for them.

International incident

Nothing happened for some months. The
Nepal government sent word they would
present the dogs, which had wandered across
the mountains from Tibet, to Eisenhower.
The President was quickly disassociated
from the negotiations, but the Nepalese said
they would make an ofﬁcial presentation of
the dogs anyway. Only they weren’t lap dogs.
They were a couple of big husky brutes used
by Sherpa tribesmen, famed mountain
climbers, as watch and herd dogs.

Air passage from Katmandu to New Delhi
was difficult to arrange, so the dogs were
piled into a jeep and driven to India on a
four-day motor trip. The ex-aide who re—
quested the dogs was billed for the food,
and air passage to the United States cost
him $400. Tongue-in-cheek diplomats con-
gratulated themselves on avoiding an inter-
national incident. Since Tibet was in Com-

munist hands, the affair might have come
under the heading of trading with the enemy.

Just about anything that squawks or
squeaks at one time or another has been an
animal ambassador. President Eisenhower
got a pygmy hippopotamus from Liberia,
two bear cubs from South Korea and a
leopard from India. President Truman was
presented with a mountain goat by a Cretan
mountaineer who said he wanted to express
his people’s gratitude for American aid by
presenting Mr. Truman with his most prized
possession. The poor inhabitants of the vil-
lage raised $60 for KriKri’s travel expenses.
Eisenhower once sent a planeload of Ameri-
can animals, including bears, antelope and
64+ reptiles to French President de Gaulle.

Feathered creatures have been popular
gifts, too. A Tokyo canary club sent two
winners in a canary contest to President
Truman. President Eisenhower received three
ﬂeet-footed gazelles from Tunisia’s Presi—
dent Habib Bourguiba. Queen Elizabeth
once received a trumpeter swan.

Even before President Kennedy took office
a feathered goodwill gift was on its way
from Istanbul. The label on the crate
read: “To President-elect Kennedy~a tur-
key from Turkey.”

about poodles

FlPTY years ago the poodle was tllII’IOSl.

unknown in the United States. Today
the poodle is the most popular breed in the
country, the count of their cold noses sky-
rocketing to well over half a million. Last
year alone almost 100,000 were registered
with the American Kennel Club.

Count Alexis Pulaski. one of the most
colorful and controversial figures in the dog
world during the past quarter century, helped
as much as anyone to stimulate the tre-
mendous vogue of the poodle. A breeder for
35 years, Pulaski made the poodle not only
the fashionable dog, but the dog of prestige.

This is invariably the dog you see poised
on the arm of an actress, strolling down Park
Avenue with the smart set, and posing for
fashion ads. i
H Pampering the poodle is a'huge industry.
Illere are poodle beauty parlors, pictures
of poodles decorate napkins, glasses and ash
trays. You can buy your-poodle suchlux-
uries as jeweled dog collars, velvet lounging

robes, pajamas, reversible raincoats and

opera coats trimmed in mink and rhine-
stones.

Pulaski. who first bred dogs in 1912 in
St. Petersburg, Russia, fears he may
have helped create a Frankenstein
monster in the poodle vogue. An ener-
getic. irrespressible man with a bold,
sensient face and a shock of thick,
white hair, he has just written a book,
“Pulaski on Poodles,” in which he
attacks some of his pet peeves. At
the drop of a jeweled leash, he’ll
launch into a tirade against what he
feels are ridiculous abuses bound to
bring the quick downfall of the
poodle.

“Poodle. shows have deteriora
ated into hairdo contests,” de-
clares the Count.

“Poodles can compete in
dog shows only if they
sport what looks like a
lion's .mane in front
and a completely ex-
posed rear. This cut
is called the conti-
nental or show clip.

“To keep this ab—

surd, cumbersome

The nation’s number one dog
embroiled in controversies

and old-fashioned hairdo,” Pulaski charges,
“show dogs must spend all their time cooped
up in a box with their hair in curlers. The
dog can’t run, play with other dogs, sit
in the sun or swim in the ocean be-
cause it might damage his coat.”
According to Pulaski, poodles were
subject to aneven sillier hairdo 70 or
80 years ago. The hair was fashioned
into long spiral curls that stuck
out all over the head like hun-
dreds of corkscrews. Some of
the curls were over three feet
long.
The Count is campaigning for
a change in show rules to allow
poodles to be exhibited in a mod-
iﬁcation of the Royal Dutch clip,
which is the clip you see on
poodles in the street. There are
tassels on the ears, a pompom
on the tail, and the face is
shaved, except for a mustache.
The body is shaved, except
for. neatly-trimmed panta-
loons around the legs.
Two years ago kennel
clubs in Europe changed
their rules to permit the

breed to be shown in competition in a simi-
lar clip and Pulaski’s battle will be won when
the American clubs get in line with. the
Europeans.

Another poodle show rule under Pulaski
tire is the ban on particolored poodles—
that is. dogs not of a solid color. Present
American show rules accept poodles in grey,
black. blue, silver, brown. apricot. cream,
cafe au lait and platinum any color, in
fact, so long as the coat is a solid color. A.
two-tone coat eliminates a poodle from corn-
petition even though he qualifies on all other
counts. The particolor dog is born in. the
same litter as solids and often produces solid
offspring. It can be registered with the
American Kennel Club, but is barred from
shows.

“The original poodle was a spotted dog.”
says Pulaski. “Around the 1600’s it was a

Cats as Pets
(Continued from page 19)

In short, when you share your home with
a cat, you must be prepared to give—not
only in terms of time and money —— but also
in terms of yourself. If the whole family is
ready to take on this sort of responsibility,
a cat could be the pet for you.

Choosing a pet

Before you take the plunge as a pet owner,
analyze your family, your habits, the size
of your children and the size of your home.
As a rule children under ﬁve are not ready
for a live pet. Older children can assume
some responsibility for the pet’s care but
don’t expect them to do it all.

The male-or-female question is sure to
come up. Both make good pets. If you want
a gentler, quieter pet, choose a female. Males
are usually livelier and more vigorous. Un-
less you expect to breed them, cats should
be neutered.

As to age, a full-grown animal is set in
his ways, but makes a ﬁne choice if you
want an already trained, less energetic pet.
However, if you enjoy molding a life to
suit your family’s personality, choose a
kitten about two or three months old. He
requires more care and attention, but the
fun you’ll have raising a kitten is worth
the effort.

Pick a healthy, active animal. Here are
some signs to look for: smooth, glossy coat;
clear eyes and nose; alertness; white teeth
and ﬁrm, pink gums. Normal temperatures
for cats range from 101 to 102 degrees.

Sleeping place

Decide ahead of time on a corner of your
home the cat can call his own. He doesn’t
need a fancy, cushioned box. A basket, box,
Chair or shelf, lined with a soft pad, cov-
ered with washable material will be quite
comfortable. Choose a clean, dry, airy spot
where he’ll get some sunlight and be out of
drafts. The cellar is too damp.

Teaching the Children

Get your child and your pet off to a good
start by reminding the children in advance
that the pet has rights too. The big point
is that pets are playmates not playthings.
Caution children to be kind, gentle and
thoughtful. If they learn these qualities in
dealing with a pet they will come to value
kindness and consideration as important as-
pects of life.

Children can be assigned some responsi-
bility in caring for the pet, but be pre—
pared to supervise their chores at ﬁrst so
the pet won’t be neglected.

Handﬂng

Part of the fun of owning a kitten is cud-
dling, wrestling and romping. Some cats join
in the fun willingly. Others don’t like to
be handled too much, and it’s better to wait
till they come to you.

To pick up a kitten support the whole
body at once. Put one hand under the front
legs and the other under the hind legs. Don’t
copy the mother cat by carrying kittens by
the nape of the neck. It’s painful for older
and heavier kittens and may injure them.

If you hurt a cat when you pick him up,
he’s likely to defend himself by biting or
scratching. He’ll become afraid of your
hands and you’ll run into difficulty when
you have to groom him, give him medicine
or ﬁrst aid.

The welcome mat

Finally, have everything ready for the
new arrival’s comfort. You’ve boned up on
cats with a good book. You know about
essential diet and special problems. You’ve
bought feeding dishes and ﬁxed up a sleep-
ing box. When the big day arrives, bring
your pet home in an atmosphere of calm.
Let him adjust to his environment without
confusion. Give him a little milk, .talk to
him gently and leave him alone for a while.
He’ll feel lonely at ﬁrst and may cry a little.
Too much fondling will only confuse him
and make him nervous. Let him investigate
on his own and he’ll quickly adapt him-
self to your way of life.

Don't
throw your
dog a bone

Puppies need something
to chew on, but
bones can be dangerous

We have a bone to pick. It concerns
owners who endanger their pets’ lives by
feeding them bones that could splinter and
puncture the pet’s throat or digestive tract.

Keep your dog away from splinterable
chicken, chop or rib bones. A bone provides
no signiﬁcant food value and does not re-
place a good meal. Your dog needs his nour-
ishment every day and a straight diet of
bones won’t ﬁll the bill.

On the other hand, there is some merit
to the idea that a puppy should have some-
thing to chew on during the painful teething
period. The trick is to give him something
that won’t hurt him.

Between four and ﬁve months a puppy
starts losing his permanent teeth, a process
that will be completed at six to seven months
of age. During this period your dog will
chew on anything available to get rid of the
old teeth and encourage the new teeth to
come through. That’s the time to provide a
safe, desirable chewing outlet to keep the pet
from ruining furniture, carpeting or shoes.

Avoid anything a dog can break or
splinter. lndigestible things that can be bitten
off in chunks, such as plastic or rubber toys,
may cause an intestinal stoppage.

Small bones might be swallowed or even
broken. Puppies grow rapidly and the power
of their jaws constantly increases. A bone
suitable at ﬁve months could be dangerous
at seven months.

A large knuckle or shin bone is safe
enough if your dog can get it into his month.
But all hard natural bones are highly abra-
sive. If your dog is an avid chewer, natural
bones may wear away his teeth prematurely.
So don’t make a lifelong habit of giving your
dog bones after the teething period is over.
Badly worn, painful teeth of many mature
dogs can be traced to excessive chewing on
natural bone.

An old leather shoe is one answer to the
chewing problem—provided rubber heel,
nails, lace grummets, metal arches etc. have
been removed. There is, of course, the haz-
ard that your dog may fail to differentiate
between his old shoe and your new one and
chew up a good pair while you’re not looking.

Most pet shops carry dried rawhide prod-
ucts of various shapes, sizes and prices. Al-
though most dogs chew them up fairly rap-
idly, they are perfectly safe.

Nylon bones, available in pet shops, are a
good, economical. substitute for natural bones
and old shoes. Dogs can’t break them or bite
a chunk off. The tough nylon’s chewing re-
sistance helps teething functions and jaw
exercise— but there is no tooth wear be-
cause nylon is non-abrasive.

Nothing, however, substitutes for periodic,
professional attention to your dog’s teeth.
Not any more than your tooth brush can do
that for you. Have your pet’s teeth profes-
siOnally cleaned at least once a year.

ET’S face it! If a thermonuclear attack

comes, ofﬁcial civil defense attention will
be focused on the survival of humans. At
present no government agency is directing
any thought to saving pets. And at the mo-
ment government policy for humans tends to
advocate the building of public community
fallout shelters from which animals will un-

doubtedly be barred.

The harsh truth is that a pet owner
anxious to save his pet, a high morale fac-
tor in any family, will have to develop his
own fallout protection. If he owns his home,
he can build a private shelter if he chooses.
But what about city pet owners living in
apartment houses who must rely on mass
shelter? Provision for their pets is impor-
tant not only for humane reasons, but also
because pets that are not provided for could
endanger the lives of humans.

Let’s assume the enemy launches a raid
to knock out a missile base 100 miles from
New York. As a resident of Manhattan you
might escape the blast, heat and ﬁre, which
created havoc, destruction and death at the
site of the explosion. But you might still be
subject to fallout radiation. Depending on
many factors, you might have as much as
an hour to get to your community shelter
before radioactive particles in the atmos-
phere reach New York.

During that precious hour what will you
do with your pet? We can examine the
courses available. If you try to take it to the
shelter, it will probably be turned away.
You could place a pan of food and water
before it and leave it in the apartment. But
you might have to remain in the shelter up
to two weeks, or even longer. By that time
your pet’s water and food supply would
have run out, and anyway open containers
will probably become contaminated with
radiation. if the animal is exposed to radia-
tion and survives, it could be a menace to
your family when you emerge from your
two-week shelter stay.

You could just put it out on the street
and hope for the best. But thousands of

panic stricken animals loose on the streets
could spread disease and create other hazards.

Another suggestion is to issue a lethal
capsule to every pet owner. In an emergency
the owner could administer the dose to his
pet to put it to sleep humanely. But mil-
lions of capsules of poison on the shelves
of America’s homes could be disastrous.
Consider the danger to children who might
accidentally ﬁnd the capsules —-— or the extra
temptation to despondents who might use
the poison on themselves.

There seems to be no ready answer to
the problem of what to do with your pet in
a big city—as indeed there is no total or
easy answer yet to the multiple problems in-
volved in human safety during and after an
attack.

Based on available civil defense advice to
homeowners building individual shelters, the
following suggestions may help those who
wish to provide for their pets, as well as
their families.

If you take a pet into your fallout shelter,
be prepared to provide it with the same
essentials you will need —-— water, food, sani-
tary facilities and medical aid. Have enough
supplies for at least two weeks.

Under extreme emergency animals might
survive for two weeks or more without food,
but they must have water. It can be stored
in cans or in a water tank. Although it may
not be palatable, water stored for long per-
iods of time is not injurious to health. As a
minimum, a small dog requires one pint a
day, a medium dog one quart and a large
dog two quarts. Cats need one half pint a
day. If the shelter temperature is very high,
more water may be needed.

Canned meat is an ideal food for dogs
and cats. So-called survival packs, consist-
ing of concentrated emergency rations, now
on the market for humans, are also suitable.
A two-week stockpile would be ﬁve pounds
of canned food for a cat and ten pounds for
a medium dog. Don’t forget a can opener
and food and water dishes. For parakeets

Humane slaughter law
Dies in committee

lt’s disappointing to report that the New
York State Legislature adjourned its 1962
session without acting on a humane slaughter
law. Bills introduced in the legislature and
backed by the New York State Humane As-
sociation (the ASPCA is a member) were
not reported out of committee.

For the third year in a row Orthodox
Jewish groups quashed the measure by bom-
barding lawmakers with arguments claiming
the bills posed a threat to religious liberty.

The fact is that the law would not in any
way interfere with Jewish ritual slaughter
(shehitah). On the contrary, it would have
protected shehitah and would have regu-
lated only the preparation of livestock for
slaughter. Within the last siX months a re-
straining pen for large animals has been
approved by the Meat Inspection Division
of the U. S. Department of Agriculture and
does not interfere with the requirements of
the Jewish ritual. The pen does away with
the inhumane and cruel shackling and hoist-
ing, a brutal practice of the slaughter house
when applied to conscious livestock.

ASPCA Director of Operations Arthur L.
Amundsen, Chairman of the New York State
Humane Slaughter Committee, and other hu-
mane leaders spent weeks in Albany talking
to legislators, appearing before committees,
and meeting with legal advisors of the
speakers of both houses, earnestly requesting
them to act favorably on humane slaughter.
Legislators at ﬁrst seemed sympathetic, but
at the last minute backed away from the
issue and failed to act.

We must try again next year. The big job
meantime is to educate the Orthodox Jewish
segment of New York State’s population. We
must convince them that humane slaughter
will in no way affect their religious ritual,
and that the only purpose of a humane law
is to spread kindness and to end unneces-
sary suffering.

Pets allowed
On May 5, the ﬁrst all-tenant dog show

in a New York residential community was
held at Park West Village, a 2400- family
apartment development on Manhattan s West
Side. Entries were restricted to pets of Park
West Villages residents.

The show points up "the fact that Webb
and Knapp, operator of the apartment build-
ings, not only permits owners to keep pets,
but encourages them. We hail this reversal
of the current trend which ﬁnds more and
more privately ﬁnanced dwellings banning
pets. New York City public housing has
never permitted animals.

In recognition of Webb and Knapp’s en-
lightened policy of encouraging pets in Park
Wrest Village and the half dozen other prop-
erties it operates in New York, we award
a Certiﬁcate of Appreciation to William
Zeckendori, Chairman of the Board of the
real estate ﬁrm.

We also helped organize the show and
presented medals and ribbons to the show
winners. About 50 dogs were entered in
such classes as best trained, most resembling
owner, best costumed, most friendly, saddest
eyes, best puppy and best groomed.

The show was a ﬁtting opening to Be
Kind to. Animals Week. We hOpe it sets a
precedent.

Animalport scene
of $150,000 Russian

The ASPCA Animalport at N. Y. In-
ternational Airport was the scene of a
$150,000 horse trading deal between
the United States and Russia recently.
The Soviet Union Ministry of Agricul-
ture purchased two blue-blooded Penn-
sylvania-bred stallions from Hanover
Farms to help improve their racing
stock.

Contracts for the sale were signed at
the Animalport, where the horses were
stabled before ﬂying on to Moscow.

 

 




 

Bill to increase dog license fee killed in New York State Legislature

A law to increase the New York City dog
license fee from $3 to $5 was passed by
the New York State Legislature by an over-
whelming majority and we were told it
awaited only the Governor’s signature. But
on the last day of the legislative session it
was called back on the ﬂoor of the Assembly
and recommended to the Codes Committee.
Since the Codes Committee had adjourned
for the session this automatically killed the
bill.

The ASPCA, which by legislative action
has been handling the licensing of dogs since
1894, had requested the increase, the ﬁrst

in 12 years, because we have been losing
money steadily on the dog license operation
since 1956. By the end of our ﬁscal year on
April 30 the losses totaled approximately
three-quarters of a million dollars.

The accompanying statement by ASPCA
President William Rockefeller was issued at
the time we requested the increase and ex-
plains why the ASPCA felt the increase

was necessary.

Unless the serious ﬁnancial picture miracu-
lously should change, the Society expects to

return to the Legislature next year.

 

STATEMENT ON DOG LICENSE FEE
BY WILLIAM ROCKEFELLER, ASPCA President

.The American Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, which has handled the
licensing of dogs in the ﬁve boroughs of the
City of New York since 1894, is asking the
New York State Legislature to increase the an-
nual license fee from $3 to $5.

This will be the ﬁrst such increase in 12
years. It is made necessary because since early
in 1956 the ASPCA has been losing money on
the dog license operation. To cover these
losses, Society C.P.A.’s report that by the end
of the current license year on April 30 the
ASPCA will have invaded its own capital funds
des1gned to support the other humanitarian
and charitable work of the Society by more
than three-quarters of a million dollars.

Under the proposed legislation the new rate
would go into effect May 1, 1962, but the
license year would remain unchanged, and ex-
tend from May 1 to the following April 30.
Meanwhile the ASPCA currently is renewing
(or $3 dog licenses good until a year front:
this coming April 30. Thus until May 1, 1963
the increase would not affect present dog
owners in New York City who renew current
licenses before the new act goes into effect.

. Further to beneﬁt dog owners, the ASPCA
for the ﬁrst time is asking legislative author-
ity to issue at a reduced rate licenses good for i
only a portion of a year, and speciﬁcally re-
quests authority to issue licenses subsequent
to November 30 in any year and good until
the next April 30, for $3. L4

Because dog owners will be given until

ay 1 to buy a license good until April 30
1963, for $3, the ASPCA cannot realize the:
full beneﬁt of the rate increase until the end

of the 1963-64 fiscal year on April 30, 1964.
16

Meanwhile, the ﬁnancial position of the li-
cense operation is as follows:

For the ﬁscal year ending April 30, 1961,
revenue from dog licenses and redemptions

in round ﬁgures was $792,500.

. For the same year adjusted related expen-
ditures, that is, those expenditures clearly in-
curred in performing those services which the
Society became obligated to render in return
for the privilege of collecting and retaining
license fees, were $948,500. A i

‘ r a O
The result was a deﬁcit in this area of

$156,000 for one year.

Similar deﬁcits in the dog license operation

have occurred each ﬁscal year since April 30,
1956, as follows in round numbers:

Year Deﬁcit
1956-57 .................. 35 76,500
1957-58 .................. 92,500
1958-59 .................. 107,000
1959-60 .................. 139,000
1960-61 .................. 156,000

The foregoing ﬁve-year deﬁcit amounts to

$571,000. ASPCA Certiﬁed Public Account-
ants estimate that by the end of the current
ﬁscal year on April 30 this ﬁgure will have
risen ‘to some $761,000, heretofore referred
to as ‘more than three-quarters of a million.”
. Currently the loss is becoming greater. This
is neither seasonal nor temporary.

For the last half-dozen years the number
of dogs subject to licensing in New York City
lias.declined steadily. Increasing prohibition
againstdiousing dogs in many areas of New
York City points to continuation of that de-

cline. Increasing fees undoubtedly will de-
crease the number of licenses issued. When
the last rate increase became effective 12
years ago, there was a fall-off of roughly 10
per cent in the number of licenses issued.
Last year the ASPCA licensed 259,000 dogs in
the ﬁve boroughs of New York City. This
ﬁgure marked a steady decline from 276,000
in 1954. An educated estimate is that the
necessary rate rise will cut the number of
licenses to some 250,000 or even possibly
240,000 by the 1963-64 license year.

ASPCA records on all dogs licensed in New
York’s ﬁve boroughs since 1954 show a de-
cline of 16,819 licensed dogs broken down by
years as follows:

Year ending Licensed

4/30 Dogs Decline
1954 276,119 —
1955 273,695 —2.424
1956 271,735 ——1,960
1957 271,560 — 175
1958 270,526 ——1,034
1959 263,994 —6,532
1960 261,798 ——2,196
1961 259,306 —.2,492

The Society’s Comptroller and its Certiﬁed
Public Accountants predict beginning as of
now, that annual expenses, despite the Soci-
ety’s efforts to curtail outgo where possible,
will move progressively upward from an esti-
mated $1,000,000 per year. This must be cou-
pled with the decline in dogs licensed to coni-
pare income with expenses. Therefore, if the
current $3 license rate were to be continued,
the immediate result would be an annual deﬁ-
cit of approximately $250,000 which the Soci-
ety could meet only by using legacies and
other gifts made for its humane activities.

In the nearly 70 years since it took over
the dog-license duties the ASPCA has inte-
grated this operation with its manifold hu-
mane activities. At no expense to the City it
has invested well over a million and a half
dollars in shelters in all ﬁve boroughs. This
amount is ﬁgured at costs of construction
which date from prior to 1950 in all instances
except for one structure erected in 1956,
rather than what it would cost to replace these
buildings today. Against this capital invest—
ment the Society on its books has charged
the license operation, for space occupied by
it, with a rental ﬁgure far below the going
commercial rate, and, in the opinion of So-
ciety C.P.A.’s, far less than the amount ne-
cessary to cover interest and depreciation on
allocable construction costs. Many administra-
tive and allied costs have been absorbed wil-
lingly, as has the capital investment in a
fleet of automobiles used, in part, for the
(log-license operation.

The Society operates ﬁve shelters within
the City of New York, one in each borough,
and on February 1, 1962 showed on its pay-

roll 216 employees of whom a minimum of
135 appropriately are charged to the license
and shelter operations called for under the
Dog License law. The ASPCA also operates 36
units of its ﬂeet of 54 automobiles to patrol
the streets of the City and to call for unwanted
a‘ninials. The ten squad cars used by the Soci-
ety’s humane-work uniformed agents are not
charged to the license department.

All shelters are open night and day for the
purpose of receiving animals and responding
to emergencies involving animals.

At each shelter the Society maintains at
no cost to the City or the public special
quarters where Department of Health veter-
inarians daily examine all animals accused of
biting. Separate kennels and wards with ne-
cessary staff are set aside where animals are
held for observation by the Department of
Health for a period of ten days or longer.

No part of the cost of operating an animal
hospital and carrying on humane work, hu-
mane education, and activities in public re-
lations and fund raising is charged to the dog
license operation.

The ASPCA does not sell animals, and all
ﬁnes imposed by Courts go to the New York
City Treasury and not to the Society.

Note must be taken of the fact that it was
contemplated by the Legislature at all times
in the past that the dog-license income would
be sufﬁcient to allow the ASPCA a certain
margin which under the law was to accrue to
the Society to continue its work in the ﬁeld
of prevention of cruelty to animals. Speciﬁ-
cally, Chapter 115 of the Laws of 1894, as
amended, empowers the ASPCA to carry out
the provisions of the New York City Dog
License Law, to issue licenses and renewals
thereof, and to collect the fees therefor. In
return, the Society is to apply these fees in
defraying the costs of carrying out the pro-
visions of the state law and maintaining
shelter for lost, strayed, or homeless animals.
The ASPCA is further authorized, as compen-
sation for enforcing the provisions of the
Anti-Cruelty Law and other statutes of the
state relating to humane work, to retain any
such fees not required for the enforcement
of the License Law and the maintaining of a
shelter. Thus there was legislative contempla-
tion of a surplus rather than a deﬁcit in the
operation.

The ASPCA has no desire to abandon dog
licensing and its related activities. More than
half a century has proved the value to the
City and its dog owners of this operation as
a day-by-day feature of the Society’s wide-
spread and economical cruelty-prevention pro-
gram. Good business and the ASPCA trustee-
ship of eleemosynary funds demand, however,
an immediate reversal of the money-losing
trend in the license operations. Continuation
of the current license fee will only accentuate
the annual deﬁcits in these operations and
rapidly threaten the solvency of the Society.

breeders, and handlers and judges! You'll enjoy hilarious,
heart/warming and true stories by (and about) some of your
friends:

Percy Roberts - Alva Rosenberg - James Trullinger
Charley Meyer - Jimmy Butler - Billy Lang - Tony
Rost - Walter Reeves - Marie Meyer - and‘others.

day Westminster during World War II. You will chuckle over the
witty come’backs of judges to exhibitors and of handlers to judges.
This is a rollicking, hootin‘ and hollerin’ book!

By an Insider — for all Insiders
and dog-loving Outsiders too !

As dog fancier, breeder, all'Terrier judge and col'

umnist, John Marvin is the ideal author and collec’

tor of these tales. He has spent a sturdy generation ..
hobnobbing with canines of all kinds and their &
human friends. He has bred 15 champions, include A

ing 3 Best in Show winners. He wrote the dog column in the
Dayton Daily News and his ﬁne breed book, The Complete West
Highland White Terrier, is receiving highest praise.

From snappy two'line bon mots to page'long passages, John takes
you from ancient times to nowadays. You go the gamut from pre
posterous hound'dog fables—like the Coon Hound that picked up 3.

Enjoy It Yourself — Give It to Friends I

scent from an ice'cube in a drink at a bar—to serious matters like
the “Vanishing American” dog judge. You go from Earth, with a
run’rabbit'run story by -a Beagle, to Outer Space where Sirius the
Dog Star shines. Out of his many friendships with dog folk, with
nary a biting word, John has distilled all the humor, path-0's, senti'
ment and charm of dogs ageless love affair with man. To him, this
book has been a lifetime labor of love.

Laced cunningly through the book you'll ﬁnd pure gems in literary
laudations to dogs by great writers like Shakespeare . . . Byron . . .
Burns . . . Cicero Somerville . . Stevenson . . . Swift . . .
Addison . . . Hood and Holmes. Their classical quotations add a
rich ﬂavor ‘to your enjoyment of the more modern tales.

Dog Lore Galore !

You'll pick up all sorts of fascinating facts: how Washington estab’
lished the ﬁrst Presidential kennel . . . how the AKC was formed . . .
when and where the ﬁrst dog show was held . . . how the world's
largest show started. Truly, these tales will wag forever!
