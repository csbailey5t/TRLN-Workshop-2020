THE BUFFALO HERD £2 THE ONONDAGA INDIAN RESERVATION

 

High among the line of hills

which the Holder Up of the Heavens

dropped long ago to destroy the Stone Giants
a meadow opens, wide and green.

There new posts of poplar and thick wire
protect the herd, dark shapes of power,
keeping them in, keeping out the guns

and narrow anger of those who envy

those few acres left the Onondagas.’

In that May meadow Indian boys

pick milkweed greens and pull the burrs

from the thick coats of grazing animals.
They relearn the old songs of Buffalo People
from the drumbeat of hooves on earth.

You walk with slow steps, the open sky
above you a face, so large you can't see
its features, only know in your heart
that it observes all you are, all you do

as the Buffalo walk on this land again,
brought back once more to remind the people
of an older balance, a promise of peace
we humans still must learn to keep.




BIRDFOOT’S GRAMPA

The old man

must have stopped our car
two dozen times to climb out
and gather into his hands

the small" toads blinded

by our lights and leaping,
live dr0ps of rain.

The rain was falling,

a mist about his white hair
and I kept saying

you can’t save them all,
accept it, get back in
we’ve got places to go.

But, leathery hands full
of wet brown life,

knee deep in 'the summer
roadside grass,

he just smiled and said
they have places to go to
too.

The gray pads of his feet
On the concrete floor.

WATCHING OTTERS IN TIME
“Lie down like children in this holiness . . .”
——Wallace Stevens, “The Auroras of Autumn”

They pour their bodies down in surface dives,

Hunting their food, coming up with blunt

Muzzles dripping and fur frazzled, sending

Their musical cries toward the strange one who watches
From shore. With lazy tails and primly folded

Paws, they relax and idle backward across

The icy April lake, plunging to pursue

The spawning rainbows. One comes up gripping

An egg-swelled belly with needle teeth, the trout
Squirming to escape, the otter ﬁrm and impassive.

The easy violence calls me home somehow:

I shed the skin of innocence. But watching

One otter swim to shore and shake the spray
From his pelt like a dog, hearing the trout being
Devoured, I feel the ﬁnal leathery shudder

Of the last mammoth shiver across my skin,

The shoreline hemlocks toppled by tides, children
Embedded in new Mindanao Deeps where Seattle
Sank and, on some deep interior pool,

An otter swimming and singing his unheard song.

Keeper Of The Keys

Through centuria
man's inhumanity to man,

his dominance over the weak,

beasts and fowl,
has defiled his trust of sovereignty;
the sacred grant of the Diety's own handiwork,
the kindred creatures that share our world.

We were ordained Keeper Of The Keys
to the kingdom

and defenseless are the animals of our domain
against the heinous, sadistic minds that
perpetrate crimes of torture, pain and neglect.
Are they not bone as our bone -

blood as our blood,

heart as our heart?
Like a child's luminous smile, is the wonder
and companionship of animals;
how bleak, the future world, without them.
If we do not make our voices heard
their future is forordained

and so is ours —

for we must suffer the devastating loss as

Keeper Of The Keys
to the kingdom.

APRIL MORNING

It is a world of contrasts.
Night brings morning

and nature spreads about
like a girl in a green skirt.

1 sip early tea in a safe world
but perspective is fragile.

Old men stare from the morning news.
Ragged and homeless,

they lean on budding trees in city parks,-
spring with no meaning

except nights will be less harsh.

They’re eating dogs in the Philippines.
Canine roasts sit on the tables

of the rich in Korea while. Japanese

make fertilizer from the smiles of dolphins.

Blacks starving in Africa

hold skin and bones

to breasts parched as the sand
that cannot remember rain
while flies suck at dry tears.

Strange how cries of innocents 9
reach halfway around the world.

Outside my window

miniature steeples of hyacinths
push through leaf mold.
Returning finches feed

on garnet fruit of bayberry.

My tea is cold.

MANNA FROM MAN’S “HANDS

In an age in which man challenges space,
Manna no longer falls from heaven.

It works its way up, from mother earth
Begotten by sun and, fresh rain,

By man’s hands, his ingenuity,

And an imperative love of nature.

Alms’giving is only a patronizing palliative.

Why not barter the best of what we bear?
The forging of plows for the secrets of the savanna
The lengthening of life for a link with the forefathers
The knowledge of literacy for riddles of the drum’s call
The teaching of science for the wisdom of patience

So that the nourishment of the hungry

Brings food for reflection to the over—fed.

Thus hunger and poverty may be cast out

And Noah will not need to build a new ark.

Dear

Thank you for your interest in our chapter.

We are a group of Vietnam Veterans who are dedicated to helping
all Nam vets and their families. This is being done with our
monthly meetings, counselling programs at the Vet Center and
special projects and events designed to make the vet and his/her
family "welcome". ' - i

Our goals currently, are establishing a building fund so that
we may have a "home of our own", the purchase of~a computer and
getting a Veteran's cemetary here in Southern Nevada. m

Several of our members belong to C.A.S.T. (Child Abduction Search
Team) and have assisted in searches for children here in the Las
Vegas area. We participate in the Special Olympics by volunteering
our help wherever it's needed. Many of our members volunteered
their time and effort when the "Moving Wall" was here in August of
1986. These are only a few of the highlights that we are involved

with.

Our meetings are the second Friday of every month, at 7 P.M. at 4
Nevada Beverage (conference room), 3940 W. Tropicana.

For your convenience, we have attached an application for member—
ship in our chapter. If you are a veteran, please enclose a copy
of yourDD-214 and mail it to us or bring it to our next meeting.

We look forward to meeting you!

WELCOME HOME!

I 6 / Wendell Bfgy

I am owned by the blood of all of them
who ever were owned by my blood.
We cannot be free of each other.

The Snake

At the end of October

I found on the floor of the woods
a small snake whose back

was patterned with the dark

of the dead leaves he lay on.

His body was thickened with a mouse
or small bird. He was cold,

so stuporous with his full belly
and the fall air that he hardly
troubled to ﬂicker his tongue.

I held him a long time, thinking
of the perfection of the dark
marking on his back, the death
that swelled him, his living cold.
Now the cold of him stays

in my hand, and 1 think of him
lying below the frost,

big with a death to nourish him
during a long sleep.

The'Peace of Wild Things

When despair for the world grows in me

and I wake in the night at the least sound

in fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be,
I go and lie down where the wood drake

rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.
1 come into the peace of wild things

who do not tax their lives with forethought

- - ief. I come into the presence of still water.

 




$HE*€tBS+NG~

Manifesto: The Mad Farmer Liberation Front

 

 

So, friends every day do something that won't compute.
Love the Lord. Love the world.

Take all that you have and be poor.

Love someone who does not deserve it.

Denounce the government and embrace the flag.

Hope to live in that free republic for which it stands.
Give your approval to all you cannot understand.

Praise ignorance, for what man has not encountered he has
not destroyed.

Ask the questions that have no answers.

Invest in the millenium.

Plant sequoias.

Say that your main crop is the forest, that you did not
plant, that you will not live to harvest.

Say that the leaves are harvested when they have rotted
into the mold.

Call that profit. Prophesy such returns.

Put your faith in the two inches of humus that will build
under the trees every thousand years.

Listen to the carrion. Put your ear close and hear the
faint chattering of the songs that are to come.

Expect the end of the world.

Laugh. Laughter is immeasurable.

Be joyful even though you have considered all the facts.
Go with your love to the field.

Lie easy in the shade.

Rest your head in his or her lap.

Swear allegience to what is highest your thoughts.

As soon as the generals and politicians and theologians
can predict the motions of your mind, lose it.

Leave it as a sign to mark the false trail, the way you
didn't go.

Be like the fox who makes more tracks than necessary, some
in the wrong direction.

Practice resurrection.

Wendell Berry
The Country of Marriage

 

 




SPARROWHAWK

(For my cat, Sinbad)

She hovers, standing on a piece of sky,

Beautiful anger beating sunlit wings.

She screams her golden curses on my head,

This angel of small deaths, who dares defy

Love's strength with destiny's. Those wild beings
That know her shadow's threat, have cause to dread;
Not you, meek friend. Her victory is dead,

Her danger crushed to futile posturings.

Rescued, embraced, your blue eyes contemplate
Lessons for cats, for sparrowhawks and kings:

That beauty does not always glorify;

That circling evil is not always fate;

That hunger is more murderous than hate;

And love is keener than the hunter's eye.

Ida.

“Lila, are you someone who might
be a good friend? I see that you might
be that. Oh, it is unbearable.” .

“I am a good friend. Don’ t ‘let the
way I look fool you. I have the soul of
a good friend.” .

“You’re a darling!”

But the world 13 unbearable: a chill
goes through Momma: in Ida’s voice
is a quality of unyielding announce-
ment on the matter. Ida is someone
who has to run things—I wasn ’t good
enough for her to hold back and let me
speak, too. I think what‘Momma sees
is that her seeing Ida :as having a
realer “beauty”. is .not triumph enough
for Ida—Ida wants to hurt Momma,
so that Ida can know more satisfacto-
rily than in Mommas being merely
temporarily agreeable that she, Ida, 1s
splendid, is the more splendid creature.
You can’t call Momma “darling” un-
less you do it with a note of defeat, or
conspiracy, without causing trouble
with her. To Ma, what Ida does seems
romantically naive.

This is What I think Momma saw:
Ida owns everyone in sight. Momma is
sexed angrily and i gnorantly and is
sexually ﬁred by curiosity. And she did
not marry for money. Ida sometimes to
Momma seems only to have the shine
and edginess and sharpness of calcula-
tion of money, and to be hardly ﬂesh
and blood at all. Momma feels that Ida
is like her, like ,Momma, but is less
well educated in love, that she is at an
earlier and more dangerous stage. Ida
is sexed ungenerously, like a school-
girl.

Momma’ s romantic standing is not
a “safe” thing for her. [1 woman like

me ﬁnds out love is a diﬁerent kettle of ‘

ﬁsh—I should have been a prostitute.
This stuff boils in Momma; it is her
sexual temper—it supplies the vivacity
in Ma’s Sultry, wanting-vengeance

—Ma sushects everyone of cheapness
when it qomes to love—except S. L,
her husband. Lila romanticizes his
emotional extravagance, his careless-
mess—perhaps he 15 romantic.

She is alive and reckless and glow-

remaining at home and being respect-
able—but she has been that so far in
her life; and she feels clever in her

THE KLIPSAN STALLIONS

Just one crack against the sandbar

and the grain freighter crumbled into
itself like paper in ﬂames, all the lifeboats

and blankets, the tons of yeasty wheat
sucked down so fast the tumbling sailors

still carried in the ﬂat backs Of their brains

the sensations of the galley, smoky with mutton fat,
someone’s hiccup, someone’s red woollen sleeve
still dragging itself across their eyes

even as the long sleeve of the water closed over them.

It was 3 A.M., the third of November, 1891.
Just to the south of this chaos, where the Columbia
washes over the Paciﬁc,

there was shouting, the groan of'stable doors,

and over the beachfront a dozen -

horses were running. Trained

with a'bucket of timothy to swim rescue,

they passed under the beam of the Klipsan lighthouse,
passed out from the grasses, alfalfa,

deep snores and the shufﬂe of hooves,

and entered the black ocean.

Just heads then, stretched nostrils and necks
swimming out to the sailors

who'were themselves just heads, each brain
a sputtering ﬂame above the water.
Delirious, bodies numb, they answered

the Stallions with panic-—

So this IS the death parade, Neptune’s
horsgs lashed up from Akasha!

And still,

through. some last act of the self, when
the tails ﬂoated past they grabbed on,

. then watched as the horses

returned to themselves, as the haunches

pulled, left, then right, and the small circles

of underhooves stroked up in unison. Here

was the sound of sharp breathing, troubled '
with sea spray, like bellows left out in the rain,
and here the texture of sand on the belly,

on the shirt and thigh, on the foot

with its boot, and the naked foot—and then, ﬁnally,
the voices, the dozens gathered to

cheer the rescue, the long bones of the will,
causing hands to close over those rippling tails,
yellow teeth to close over the timothy.

erate as Ida, and as urkcathed so far:
this is what she .claims\by\being/s‘o
willful—that she is usually rigift, un-

punished This is what her destrue—N

tiveness comes from.

Both women feel that women draw
you in and are grotesquely lonely and
grotesquely” powerful in intimacies.

da has a coarse look. What it is is that
Ida has to be the star. Ida’s courage is
self-denial and self-indulgence mixed.
Momma’ 3 performance is ill-
mounted, since it rests on Ida’s having
a haunt. Ma has risen from the void of
dailiness and nobodyhood to ﬂutter in
the midst of her whitish ﬁre, but she

 




BROWN (197l--1984)

I write as though you could unde
And I could say it
One must always pretend something
Among the dying
--from ”For a Coming Extinction”
by N.S. Merwin

So, here it is, Brown,

even filthier than you used to get

in a wet December field, even smellier

than your constant

black-and-red-gummed panting.

Your death 1

has been brought right to you, you lazy dog.

You don’t have to ask any more

of eyes that have pulled blue curtains

or back legs too stiff to lift

and quick to turn every surface icy

or a clumsy heart

or lungs that are already going back

to swamps like the ones they were born to work in.

Here it is, you big web—footed poodle.

Too soon. From not nearly as far away

as we tried to think, ‘“

something almost friendly

has fetched your death.

We found it rolled up on the step this morning
on top of the human news.

So, take it, Brown. Don’t

just wag and want your ears rubbed,

you dumb dog, you bump, you noodle,

you soft-bitten pussycat.

It’s the least you could do in a century--
one trick

you didn’t make up yourself.

" Ode lo the Sea sneuneru

By Letty Filler

Dig your proud prow into the icy depths

Inch your stalwart timbers toward the goal

Carry your dedicated crew to the victory of good over evil.
Man and ship cutting through the ﬁerceness

Ofthe cruel sea and its icy jams

Danger stalking your every movement

Toward that ultimate terrible destination

To stop the de~picable kill. the young blood spill

Of an0ther of The Good Shepherd‘s lambs.

Come back to us who pray and weep for your mission
Come back great ship your battle won

There are other animals and Other men

Who will need your help to win again.

One of our favorite Fund members, Edyth Ziegler, has
all her life carried around the following poem, which
we’ve called “A Prayer.” Does anyone know the author?

This is a prayer for little paws
All up and down the land.
Driven away. no friendly voice,
Never an outstretched hand.

For weary little paws of beasts
Torn and stained with red.

And never a home and never a rest
Till little beasts are dead.

Oh God of homeless things. look down
And try to ease the way

Of all the little weary paws

That walk the world today.

 

 

.'"‘17ie chant is an assertion
- of a nonusurious communal sharing of soul
among members of the body of nature.
including the animals and the trees and the grasses.
I think it s partly our economic system that forbids us to chant.
It's embarrassing. It's a whole area
of communal family n'tualfeeling which is feared

 

because it is a breakthrough onto a new consciousness
which is not like the social consciousness inculcated
by television or radio or newspapers or politics.
* It is the compassionate consciousness of the mind and the heart
. that we share with the bald eagles and the blue whales.
and since we keep killing all the whales and the bald eagles
it wouldn't be appropriate to voice that consciousness.
I mean, it would be revolutionary
. to voice that consciousness."

SMALL ESTATE
For Z.

When the dog died we buried

the orange bowl, the pink blanket,

and the red rubber bone, sweet-breath-
scented, made in England-—

kept the collar and leash
hanging still in the entryway
under coats and umbrella hooks.
Hairs are herevand there--

black, white needles stitched

to an old pair of slacks at the back
of the closet, or falling from even
lwell'vacuumed cracks in the couch.

The gold throw has loops

where claws have caught, but

the corners, the sun on the rug,
the mat by the door hold less

than themselves to mark an eight-year
presence. The clutter of me

that is this room wants to be

such a friend, to go unencumbered,
leaving so little to fill great emptiness.

LATE PP OSPE

The old work horse is coaxed out of the van and
into the early June sunshine. A sugar cube in his
hand, the caretaker has been through it hundreds
of times. No one believes the horse will live
another week, least of all his owner whom he has
ceased to recognize.

He is led into the barn where he is scrubbed and
fed a helping of specially prepared grain. In a
few days he will be nudged through the barn doors
and put out to pasture. Mornings he will return
to be fed, and no one will have to lead him.

In a week he will be walking effortlessly, and in

two weeks he will be trotting the way he did some
thirty years before. His skin will gain a fine
luster, and the color of his coat will begin to
deepen° Such, will say the caretaker, are the
benefits of clomping over meadows, and of the
companionship of fellow horses.

Later he will grow a bit fat and cantankerous.
He will shiver down the length of his backbone
our hand over his mane. anly—the
ill seek his comfort. On a
cold day they w1 ll warm their paws on his muzzle
as¥he picks his way through the season s remainq
Engk cluster of daisies.

BEAR WARNING

BY

William Borden

In the sand along the lake someone's
footprints splay the sand

bearlike. Or a bear has snuck among us,
disguised as a rational being, and we have not

distinguished his growls in the morning

from ours. We're all heavy

and hairy this year. And snort, snuffle,
swing our arms as we walk
upright, and remain mute and yellow-eyed

when accused of tracking mud across the floor.

 




Calling Ravens

The first irreverent sound is like a broken-toe

cry in the dark, but it is morning

and the playful shadow circling

signals the ravens' return to Roane Mountain.

I lift my head from my sleeping bag and scream back
to see if the raven will turn and answer.

The bird answers out of curiosity. He'd like to know
what creature would call a raven so crudely.

From the air I must look like I am being swallowed
by a large blue caterpillar. Three more ravens

join to see the feeding as I pull the mummy bag

over my head and barely peer out with eye and nose.
My breath smokes in the mountain air; the ravens all
scream to coax me into making my noise.

So I call again a little too shrill

and they recognize me, become bored

and fly away batting and nudging each other in raven joy.
Quite awake now, I think about hot coffee and watch
the sun rise above mulitple mountain humps

where there must be thousands of ravens screaming,
flirting in the brisk air and this thought is broken
by more shadows tracing the mountain contour.

I blurt out a shrill cry which sends a puff of steam
drifting like a small cloud into the air.

They do not answer.

WORDS FOR A DEAD VIXEN FOX

 

to Duane Niatum.

Though all that is past and your soul is in me now
I start at the beginning, when you crossed

the mountain road and were dragged thumping
among the wheels of the car ahead, thrown out
into the agonizing sunlight, your front legs frantic
to drag a crippled body down the bank

and into the leaf-thick spring woods

So many beautiful words: foxfire, the red glow of
a phosphorescent night; foxglove, delicate sway

in the wind of winged blossoms; foxberries, crimson
iacketed among greenwaxen leaves. . .

and there before me, the broken animal running

to escape the pain of wheels crushed into its back.

I had the car Stopped and was down the bank,

over the spring-running stream, breaking off a
branch 'to hold you down inits fork

(remembering the chance of rabies -- another

gift they and their dogs have brought).

Your mouth gaped, your feet still ran in the rattling
leaves; with my hand I felt the shattered spine, knew
the only thing I could do, pressed my foot on your chest
and closed my‘eyes' until you were quiet.

 

A vixen, your dugs showed me there were no cubs.
That alone was good -- for had there been

I might have left myself in those woods

instead of only broken fingernails from digging
thegrave in the leaves and webbed spongy roots.
And I left you, curled cat-small,

brush tail over delicate head,

and took with me, along with the earth

on my hands, as I said at the beginning,

Your soul .

THE DOLPHIN BUlilAL

The dark skin of the men
and the messenger of the Sea god
tum white with salt in the dry wind from the desert

The nets are tom
the ﬁsh scattered silver coin
on the beach and the near waves

The eyes which were deep
as the surge of tide
are closed

The men of Thunder come to the beach
a long procession of bells
and muted drums

Long ago it was seen

that the ocean pe0ple are one with us
Even the haughty steps

of the Chief Priest

betray the hesitation which marks grief

Wrapped in the shroud of blue net
that body sleek as the rushing wave
is lifted by seven men

Now, given the name
of the day of his death
he lies by the side of long past chiefs

 

For seven nights

let the drums compress the darkness
and spread it in throbbing tones
across Anlo

Band of black across his shoulders
band of black along his back

the only stranger born into a litter
of red brothers and sisters

eyes bright, but his brighter

with another knowledge.

This is the one the breeders sought

the one whose blood would have brought forth
in the Fur Farm cages a rainbow of colors,
platinum, silver, costly gold.

This is the fox who was not caught.

The cross he carries on his back

is the four directions of this land,

the ways the People of the Dawn knew,
ways of the four winds and not the ﬁgure
held in carved agony, the dying god.

Living, he carries his cross
from the Earth

he was born in

back to the Earth.

He will not die in the air.
