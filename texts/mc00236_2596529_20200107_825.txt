OTHER WORK

In addition to anthologies in which I
served in an editorial capacity, I kept
myself busy throughout the 1970s writ—
ing a number of essays for a mainly pro-
fessional audience, some of which were
collected in All That Dwell Therein:
Essays on Animal Rights and Environ-
mental Ethics (1982). Whatever their
philosophical shortcomings may be,
these essays chart the history of my
struggle to articulate a rights-based
understanding of the moral ties that bind
us to other animals. Each is a sketch at
best. But each seems to me now to have
been an essential step along the way to

tunate recipient of a Fellowship from the
National Endowment for the Humani-
ties. I am a compulsive rewriter. I doubt
if there is a single sentence in The Case
that wasn’t recast at least once. Maybe
even twice. Physically, the work was
exhausting. Psychologically, it was
invigorating. I never was tempted to
abandon the project. Once underway I
never veered off course. I was never
depressed or displeased about how the
book was going. Each day was too short,
not too long. I was absolutely ﬁlled
with, and by, the process of writing.
There is another point I should men—
tion. When I started The Case I did not
hold the “radical” conclusions I reach in
the ﬁnal chapter. At the beginning I was
against causing animals “unnecessary”

the view I was looking for.
That view is set forth in The Case for

to getting at the deeper truths on which,
in my view, the Animal Rights Move-
ment stands or falls. It is a work of seri—

the language of philosophy: “direct
duties,” “acquired rights,” “utilitarian-
ism,” and so on.

years ahead, working with others, I will be searching for ways to
hasten this development. ‘

Finally, more writing is still in my blood. Even as I write these
words, I have several essays under way and others in the back of my
mind. Moreover, Empty Cages will need to be revised and updated in
the not too distant future. And there is always that general
introduction to moral philosophy that is brewing in my brain. So, no,
I’m not ready to hang up my keyboard just yet. As fOr that video

especially toward the end of the compo—
sition of the book, was qualitatively
unlike anything else I have ever exper—
ienced. It was intoxicating. It was as
close to anything like a sustained
religious or spiritual revelation as I have
ever experienced.

I can» never think of my past withoat
heing overwhelmed hy how mach of
what has happened to me (and this
inelades the very hest things) was dae
to factors qaite heyond my control. I try
to rememher this when I meet people
whose ideas and valaes diﬁfer signif-
eantly from my own. “There hat for a
series of contingencies go I, ” I think.

 

Of course, when you have a book
published, you can’t help hoping for
favorable reviews, written by really
important people, published in highly
prestigious places. Fortunately, The Case
enjoyed a number of such responses. One
in particular, written by the late Robert
Nozick, had an interesting afterlife.

As it happened, Nozick and I both
attended the same philosophy confer—
ence in December 1983. At this time
Nozick was among the three or four
most inﬂuential moral philosophers in
the world, so it was with some trepid—
ation that, spotting him, I introduced
myself.

He could not have been nicer. He
was warm, and effusive in his praise.
“There’s just one thing I want to know,”
he said. Drawing me closer, he asked,
“Now what are you going to do?”

Without having fully realized it, this
question had been gnawing away at me
ever since I ﬁnished The Case. I mean,
what was I going to do now that I had
emptied myself of everything that went
into the book?

“Well,” I said, looking for an answer,
“I guess I’ll...I guess I’ll. You know, I
guess I don’t know.”

“You will,” Nozick replied. “You
will.” And with that we shook hands and

parted company. I have never met any—
one who knew me so well so quickly.

What was I going to do? One thing I
knew: I did not want to try to write
another “big book” on animal rights any
time soon. After mulling things over,
three fresh possibilities presented them-
selves.

First, ifI was going to continue to try
to make a contribution to the Movement,
as a philosopher, I would need to ﬁnd
new ways of doing so. Second, ifI want—
ed to try to make a contribution in some
other way, I needed to look for new out-
lets. Third, if there was something else I
could explore, some new creative chal—
lenge that had nothing to do with animal
rights, I would have to discover what
this was.

So (to repeat N ozick’s question):
what was I going to do? The answer I
reached—the one I have tried to live the
past 20 years and more—was, “All of
the above.”

TOM REGAN, THE HISTORIAN?

One creative challenge required a
near total immersion into late 19th and
early 20th century English history. It
was during these years that the famous
Bloomsbury Group began to take shape
and ﬂourish. Members included Virginia
Wolfe and her sister, Vanessa, as well as
John Maynard Keynes and Lynton
Strachey. The Group was as renowned
for its unconventional behavior. as for its
brilliance.

Oddly, the Bloomsburies identiﬁed
the philosopher George Edward Moore
as their chief inspiration. I knew
Moore’s philosophy reasonably well,
having written both my Master’s Thesis
and part of my Ph.D. Dissertation on his
theories. His laborious style of writing
shaped my philosophical voice as a
writer more than anything else. Despite
this inﬂuence, Moore the man always
struck me as more conventional than
brilliant. It seemed wildly improbable to
me that the Moore I knew could have
had the inﬂuence the Bloomsburies
attributed to him.

With the luxury of a year’s leave as a
fellow at the National Humanities
Center, I set out to ﬁnd the answer to the
riddle before me. My answer is given in
Bloomsbury ’s Prophet: G.E. Moore and
the Development of His Moral
Philosophy (1983), followed by Moore:
The Early Essays (1988), and GE.
Moore: The Elements of Ethics (1992).
Without my having to say so,
theSe new books said that Tom
Regan was exploring a new
line of work, in (of all things)
the history of ideas. It would
not be the last time I would
embrace a ﬁeld of study my
disgruntled younger self had
rejected.

ROUSING THE SLEEPING
GIANT

Some animal rights advo—
cates are openly hostile
towards religion in general,
Christianity in particular. It is
not hard to understand why.
Given standard readings of the
Bible, animals were put on earth to
satisfy human wants and needs. This is
why hogs fulﬁll their God— given destiny
by ending up as pieces of bologna
between two slices of bread.

However, this is just one possible
reading of scripture, and an implausible
one at that. When God gives humans
dominion, we are given the task of being
as loving towards Creation as God was
in creating it in the ﬁrst place. That’s
how I read the opening chapters of
Genesis. I don’t know how anyone can
read the words found there and come
away with a different understanding.

To my way of thinking, therefore,
everything depends on what love for
Creation comes to. If (as I believe) it
makes no sense to kill those you love, or
to make them suffer, or to deprive them
of their full measure of freedom, then
the Bible is nothing if not pro—animal
rights, whatever others might say to the
contrary.

Fortunately, some animal rights

advocates agreed, Ethel Thurston and
the late Colin Smith among them. On
behalf of the International Association
against Painful Experiments on Ani-
mals, Ethel and Colin invited me to
organize and chair a major 1984 confer-
ence on religion and animals. In 1986, I
was privileged to publish the proceed-
ings under the title Animal Sacrifices:

 

Religious Perspectives on the Use of
Animals in Science.

The year after the London confer-
ence, with the support of Claire and Bill
Allan, among others, I was able to write
and direct a half-hour ﬁlm, We Are All
Noah. When the ﬁlm won a Silver
Medal at the 1985 International Film
Festival of New York, everyone involved
in its production thought we ﬁnally had
a teaching aid that would rouse the
sleeping giant of organized religion. It
did not take long for us to realize that we
should have thought again.

Dietrich von Haugwitz has been a
dear friend for the better part of three
decades. Working with other members
of the North Carolina Network for
Animals, Dietrich found a place where
Noah could be shown. Hundreds of
invitations were sent to clergy in the area
even as the event was publicized in other
ways. A lovely spread of meat-free
ﬁnger food was prepared. And (as has
always been true of anything he does)

donating my papers, which I was more than happy to do. Since its
founding, the Tom Regan Animal Rights Archive has grown
dramatically, thanks to major additions from the Animal Welfare
Institute and the Animal Rights Network, among others. Even today
the Archive is far and away the premiere repository of animal rights
materials in the world; it will only get better as time passes.

The First Year Seminars. The Research Ethics Initiative. The
Tom Regan Animal Rights Archive. For me personally, these are
tangible lifelines to the future. For generations of students and
scholars to come, like footprints, they will attest to my having passed
this way. The pleasure I feel in knowing I am leaving something
behind is beyond my ability to express.

The same is true, in other ways, now that our children have
married and have children of their own. There’s something of my
genes, and Nancy’s too, in Brooke, Hannah, Anna Drew, and our
grandchildren yet to be born. They, too, attest to our having passed
this way. Such joy they and their parents bring to our lives; so many
blessings; too many to count.

MILES TO GO BEFORE I SLEEP

Talk of footprints might give the impression that I think my
work is finished. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is so
much to do, so much that needs doing. Here are some examples.

College students are a group too frequently ignored by the
animal rights movement. I think they are ready to be ”radicalized” in
ways that remind one of the student unrest of the sixties. Our
students today suffer from pent-up idealism. They want—and
need—to be part of something larger than themselves, something
good. And this good thing will be better in their View if their parents
did not champion it before them. The present generation of students
wants and needs a new cause—their cause.

I have no doubt that ARAs can help them choose the cause of
animal rights. A tangible way to measure our success is to keep track
of the number of animal rights groups we have on the thousands of
campuses here in the United States, and the thousands more
worldwide. Our goal should be to have a Student Animal Rights
Group on every campus. As I continue to present lectures at various
colleges and universities, I fully intend to do what I can to help make
this goal a reality.

Dietrich had composed a ﬁrst—rate intro-
duction to the ﬁlm.

So there we all were, waiting for the
ﬁrst arrivals. And there we sat, waiting.
And waiting. And waiting. Will it sur—
prise anyone when I say, “No one
came”? It surprised all of us, no one
more so than a crestfallen Dietrich. One
thing was certain: it would take a lot
more hard work, involving many more
people, to rouse the sleeping giant.
Happily, the last twenty years have wit—
nessed many positive changes, much of
them spurred on by the ﬁne work of
writers like Keith Akers, Daniel
Dombroski, J .R. Hyland, Roberta Kal-
echofsky, Gary Kowalski, Andrew
Linzey and Richard Schwartz.

TALK, TALK, TALK

Publication of The Case opened new
doors. Invitations to present lectures on
campuses, give speeches at rallies, and
read papers before professional meet-
ings increased. I have never kept an
exact record of when and where I have
spoken; all I know is that, whether for
good or ill, I’ve done a lot of talking.

My stump speech was “Animal
Rights, Human Wrongs,” in which I
sketched the central philosophical issues
deﬁning the animal rights debate. The
response that greeted my scholarly
ruminations sometimes was surprising.
Here are two examples.

The philosophers at one university
invited me to their campus. In the
months leading up to my lecture, local
and national animal rights groups had
targeted the work of campus researchers
who were doing ghastly experiments on
nonhuman primates. You could feel the
tension in the air.

When I arrived at the room where I
was scheduled to speak, the overﬂow
crowd blocked my way. New arrange—
ments were quickly made: I would
speak to a standing room-only audience
in a large auditorium. Before entering, I
was taken aside and introduced to the
head of campus security. He would be
sitting in the middle of the front row. If

things got out of hand, he would wink at
me and mouth the words, “Head for the
nearest exit!”

So there he was, in the front row,
looking at me with a wide-eyed inten—
sity. I’m sure everyone has had the
experience of doing one thing even as
we are thinking about another. That’s
how things were for me. I was covering
familiar philosophical ground: moral
standing, indirect duties and so on,
while, in the back of my mind, I was
thinking, “Just wait till I get to Kant’s
categorical imperative: that’s when all
hell will break loose!” Needless to say,
when I got to Kant, all hell did not break
loose.

On another occasion, all hell broke
loose before I arrived. Faculty who did
research on animals were enraged that I
would be invited to their campus.
Letters of protest were circulated in
which I was described as a dangerous
zealot and a rabble—rousing demagogue.
The researchers likened me to Hermann
Goring and to monomaniacal mental
patients who think they are Jesus Christ
or Napoleon; one spokesperson even
went so far as to call me the Jim Jones of
the animal rights movement.

PEVthPS . . . there is in everyone at
nntnml longing to help fi/ee nnin/inls
from the hnnels of theiir oppressons—
n longing only wnitingfor the right
oppontnnity to assert itself.

 

As for my public lectures, the
researchers accused me of advocating
violence, spreading lies, of asserting that
I have the right to impose by violent
means my notion of ethics on others;
and of inﬂaming my audiences to com-
mit unlawful acts. And there was the
“suggestion” that the invitation should
be revoked because I was a prime sus-
pect in the recent murder of a researcher,
shot dead in his driveway.

Not a word of what they said is true;
all of it is pure ﬁction. It just goes to

editor's response was one of startled incredulity. He looked at me as if I was in
immediate need of the most profound psychiatric help.

"You want to publish a book on," he began. Unable to complete the
sentence, he tried again. "You want to publish a book . . . on . . This time he
found it impossible to stiﬂe his laughter. Guffaw. Guffaw. ”I’m sorry,” he said,
"but this is too much. I mean, ’animal rights’!” More guffawing. If there had been
a hole in the floor, I would have crawled into it, I was so embarrassed. And
angry, too.

But here’s the rest of the story. The editor took the prospectus home,
looked it over, and sent it our for review. A few months later, Singer and I had a
contract in hand. Over the years, that little book, now in its second edition, has
sold tens of thousands of copies and has been read by tens of thousands of
students. As for the philosophy editor: after making a name for himself as
someone who was ahead of the times, he went on to have a distinguished career
in the world of book publishing.

Animal Rights and Human Obligations was just one among many books that
found a niche in the college market from the 19705 onward. It is no exaggeration
to say that, during the past 30 years, philosophers have written vastly more on
the topic of ethics and animals than our predecessors had written in the previous
three thousand.

This has made a profound difference in the classroom. Whereas there was
not a single philosophy course in which the idea of animal rights was discussed
when I began writing ”T he Moral Basis of Vegetarianism,” today there are
perhaps as many as a hundred thousand students a year discussing this idea.
Just in philosophy. Comparable changes are underway in other disciplines,
including anthropology, art history, film studies, law, literature, religion, and
sociology. Clearly, in the world of ideas, in university class rooms throughout

the world, ”animal rights” no longer is a laughing matter.

”THERE’S A MOVEMENT OUT THERE . . . SORT OF.”

 




“None of us is so acculturated that we sleep walk through our moral lives.” (p.
117)

From Defending Animal Rights

“Depending on one’s perspective, humanity is either on the borders of a new
world that promises a harvest of hitherto undreamed of benefits, populated by
compassionate Dr. Spocks anglik Welbys, or poised on the sharp precipice of
our worst nightmares, peopl . 'th the good doctors Frankenstein and Moreau.”

(p. 1) '

”[W]hat we should do in practice depends on understanding what we ought to
do in principle." (p. 24)

”T he true objective for which animal advocates should work . . . is not to provide
animals with larger cages but to empty them." (p. 35)

”[T]he interest of those who profit from animal exploitation should play no role
whatsoever in deciding whether to abolish the institution that furthers those
interests.” (p. 37)

”T he struggle for animal rights . . . calls for a deeper, more fundamental change
in the way we think about membership in the moral community. It demands not
an expansion but a dismantling of the for-humans-only conception, to be
replaced by one that includes other-than—human animals.” (p. 141)

and one activists showed up there, like a
hurricane making landfall.

Once crushed inside, we all sat
down, some in chairs, most on the ﬂoor.
Then we started to chant, at the top of

 

 

our lungs, “What do we want? Animal
rights! When do we want them? Now!”
Our entrance was so unanticipated, our
presence so undeniable, and our volume
so loud, that the staff in that ofﬁce were
in total shock. If a boulder had fallen
through the roof, it would have made
more sense to them than our being there.
As we chanted ever more enthusiastic-
ally, we all thought the same thing. We
ﬁgured the police would be there any
minute.

But the police were nowhere to be
found as, ﬁrst one, and then another staff
person left. Then other people in other
ofﬁces were seen leaving until, to our
surprise, the entire eighth ﬂoor had been
vacated. Without having set out to do so,
the intrepid animal rights activists were
in charge of thousands of square feet of
federal government property.

Our occupation lasted four days
during which time some of the original
participants had to leave, the air con-
ditioning was turned down to arctic tem—
peratures (some NIH ofﬁcials got the
idea they could freeze us out), and the
media and members of Congress
actually began to pay attention to why
we were there.

When, on the morning of July 19,
1985, the remaining civil disobedients
marched out of Building 31—B, the fund—
ing for the lab having been withdrawn,
we all felt that animal rights was a force
to be reckoned with. None among us
could doubt that we had seized the
offensive, that there would be no stop—
ping us now. Five years later, this same
feeling of robust confidence would
reassert itself again, only multiplied
more than a thousand-fold.

"ONWARD ANIMAL RIGHTS
SOLDIERS!"

Gwyneth Snyder, Diana Basehart,
and a handful of other California animal
rights activists deserve credit for formu-
lating the idea. Scores of others deserve
credit for helping implement it. Every-
one agreed: the time had come to ﬂex
our muscles. We were going to march on
Washington!

As plans evolved, I was asked to co-
chair the March with Peter Gerard. This
does not mean that we shared the work
equally. Peter did far more than I did
when it came to the details: advertising
the event, getting the necessary permits,
crafting a program, and so on. My main
jobs were to help raise funds and to
motivate animal rights activists to par-
ticipate. The latter was much easier than
the former.

When the day of the march dawned, all
the Regans wandered down to the assem—
bly area. We did not know what to expect.
We were just hoping we would not be
among the few on hand. We were not.

Huge banners waved in the wind for
each of the states. Huddled around each
banner were ﬂags identifying all the
groups from the several states, some—
times, in the case of Alaska, for exam-
ple, a handful, sometimes, for California
and New York, a truckful.

This was one noisy family reunion!
Music could be heard at every turn.
Some folks were singing, others were
chanting. Vendors were selling every-
thing that had anything to do with animal
rights, from soy dogs to belt buckles.

The decision to adopt a vegetarian lifestyle was something Nancy and I
made in private, so to speak. At the time, we had no idea that vegetarianism had
a long history populated with famous people (Ovid, Plutarch, Charlotte Bronte,
Susan B. Anthony, Weird Al Yankovic, to name a few). Moreover, we were
largely unaware that there were organizations and publications that promoted a
vegetarian life-style, some for reasons of health (a vegetarian diet is good for
you), others for ethical reasons (a vegetarian diet shows respect for animals).
Much to our surprise, we discovered that there were national and international
conferences organized around vegetarianism in particular, animal protection
issues in general. There was something that looked like a ”movement” out there,
or at least something that was trying to become one. It was an exciting time to be
alive. The first international animal protection conference Nancy and I attended
will be forever etched in the aging folds of our graying memory.

The conference took place at Cambridge University in the summer of
1978. Hosted by one of England's venerable animal societies, it focused on the
ethical ties that bind humans to other animals and featured leading thinkers from
throughout the world. It was an honor just to be in their presence.

You can imagine our surprise, therefore, when Nancy and I went to the
first evening’s dinner and found that Beef Wellington was the main course.
Things went steadily down hill from there. Breakfasts included ham, bacon,

kippers, and sausage. Lunches were redolent with all manner of cuts of meat,

some of which (various sweet meats and slabs of bloody tongue, for example) no

American had seen before or has seen since. Venison was served the second

evening. Roast leg of lamb the third. And for the gala final evening’s banquet?
Veal Cordon Bleu.

Among those in attendance were a handful of like-minded vegetarians.
Banding together, we asked, in the most polite manner, for some
accommodation. If we were going to spend the day talking about our duties to
animals, we said, we preferred not to spend our meals eating them.

The request was received as heretical. How dare we ask for special
treatment! If the organizers had had a branding iron at their disposal, I do not
doubt for a moment that some of them would have burned the letter ”V” into
our foreheads, the better to shame us for our vegetarian insolence. Consigned to
a table in a far, dark corner of the dining hall, away from the other diners (lest
they be contaminated by our presence), the rebellious vegetarians were treated as
moral untouchables. And this by people who said they cared about animals. It
was the first (but not the last) time Nancy and I learned that different people
sometimes understand animal protection differently.

It was an important lesson. When we returned home from Cambridge, we
were emboldened. We had a clearer understanding of who we were and what we
believed. We were not about to change. The people operating the venerable
English animal society would have to change. And (over time) they did. Eight
years later, when they hosted another international conference on animal

protection, no meat was served. Only by then the vegetarians had evolved into

vegans and were wanting a different accommodation. But that’s another story.

 




Other major constituencies cry out for attention. The
Animal Rights Movement is only one part of the larger
movement for social justice. It must begin to align itself
with other parts — with the Peace Movement, for example,
and the Greens; with organizations ”yd? *9ng missing
children and those working to help battere ' s; and with
still other groups who labor for justice for East Asians,
Blacks, Chicanos, and other minorities. Representatives of
these and other groups must be a part of our Movement’s
campaigns and rallies. And the same is true of the working
class. I am a product of that class and have deep loyalties
and affection for those who comprise it. The Movement
must learn how to reach out to these decent men and

wome' .

 

I hope I will ﬁnd ways to help those who are working for this same
goaL

Because I am not a pacifist, I am committed to the belief that the
use of violence sometimes is justified. For some ARAs, violence
necessitates that a sentient being is harmed. If you blow up a
building and on one is hurt, no violence is done.

This distorts rather than clarifies the notion of violence.
Someone who burns down an abortion clinic or torches a mosque
does some serious Violence even if the structures are empty.
Speciﬁcally, then, when the Animal Liberation Front or the Earth
Liberation Front engages in arson and other forms of property
destruction, what they do is violent. When they deny this, they avoid
the truth rather than speaking it.

I believe the vast majority of ARAs agree with me when I say,
”The violent actions of ALF and ELF are not acceptable; they do not
represent my values.” Gandhi never leveled buildings in pursuit of
his objectives. Martin Luther King, Jr. never vandalized property in
the name of justice. When the opportunity arises, especially at
meetings of ARAs, I plan to speak-up for the Gandhian principles I
think should guide our movement.

Of course, forswearing the use of violence does not mean we
must forgo active protest. When I joined other ARAs in the
nonviolent occupation of NIH, I certainly did not think that I was
doing nothing. Our problem is not that we have too many nonviolent
ARAs who are willing to go to jail as the price of civil disobedience.
Our problem is that we have too few. The day may come when we
are able to fill the jails with nonviolent ARAs. I hope so. Our
movement is unlikely to triumph if that day never dawns. In the

show the lengths to which “experts”
who don’t like the idea of animal rights
sometimes will go in their attempt to
discredit those who would dare to dis—
agree with them.

"THERE'S A HOLE IN THE MOVEMENT"

The Animal Rights Movement is so
varied in its membership and programs
that it will never have one leader. No, the
movement goes forward because of the
efforts of many hands, on many oars.
Much of this work involves recruitment:
attracting new people. Another part
requires educating ourselves about our
deep cultural roots—in philosophy and
poetry, art and sculpture, music and
dance.

Moreover, we must continue to add
to this body of cultural resources, not
just rest content with those we already
have. Back some 20 years ago, when
Nancy and I looked around, we discov—
ered that no one was helping make this
happen. Right at its center, there was a
hole in the movement.

The need to fill this hole was what
motivated the creation of The Culture
and Animals Foundation (CAF). Now
entering its twentieth year, CAF is a tax—
exempt, nonproﬁt, all—volunteer organi-
zation that raises and distributes money
to fund three programs: research,
creativity and performance.

Over the years, CAF has funded hun-
dreds of “cultural activists” (as we call

ing 31-B 0n the National Institutes
of Health campas. All 101 activists

them) and hosted an annual International
Compassionate Living Festival, working
collaboratively in 2004 with the Institute
for Animals and Society. Thousands of
people have attended, always returning
home with passions stirred and minds on
ﬁre. Watching CAF’s birth and growth,

with the assistance of current board
members Marion Bolz, Rondi Elliot, and
Jean Hollowell, has been a source of
great pleasure and satisfaction for Nancy
and me.

"PUT UP OR SHUT UP!"

There comes a time in everyone’s
life when the sincerity of our commit-
ment is on the line. For me, that time
came in the summer of 1985. That’s
when I decided it was time to get
arrested.

In May of this same year members of
the Animal Liberation Front “liberated”
more than 70 hours of videotape of
research being done at a head injury lab-
oratory at the University of Pennsyl-
vania. The tape revealed numerous
violations of federal guidelines and pre-
sented the researchers as uncaring,
sometimes even sadistic. Funded by the
National Institutes of Health (NIH), the
research had been going on for years
and was headed nowhere.

The stolen tapes somehow ended up
in the hands of Ingrid Newkirk and Alex
Pacheco, founders of People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals. Unneces—
sary Fuss, a 26-minute video, sum-
marized what was happening. The case
against the lab was incontestable. So
what did the funding agency do? Like
spitting in the eyes of Animal Rights
Advocates everywhere, NIH increased
the funding. It was time to act.

On the evening of July 14, a hundred
and one animal rights activists gathered
at a motel not far from the NIH. Each of
us had a “buddy” (mine was Bobbie
Wright, a wonderful activist from Ari-
zona). Plans were sketched. Every one
of us knew what we were supposed to
do. And when.

To this day I still remember walking
into Building 3l—B on the NIH campus,
meeting Bobbie in the cafeteria, taking
an elevator to the top ﬂoor, then (at the
appointed time) descending stairs and
entering the funding ofﬁce. Mind you:
Bobbie and I were not the only folks
who entered at that time. All hundred

Of course, when you have a book published, you can’t help
hoping for favorable reviews, written by really important people,
published in highly prestigious places. Fortunately, The Case enjoyed
a number of such responses. One in particular, written by the late
Robert Nozick, had an interesting after-life.

As it happened, Nozick and I both attended a December 1983
meeting of the American Philosophical Association. At this time
Nozick was among the three or four most inﬂuential moral
philosophers in the world, so it was with some trepidation that,
spotting him, I introduced myself.

He could not have been nicer. He was warm, and effusive in his
praise. ”There’s just one thing I want to know,” he said. Drawing me
closer, he asked, ”Now what are you going to do?”

Without having fully realized it, this question had been
gnawing away at me ever since I finished The Case. I mean, what was I
going to do now that I had emptied myself of everything that went
into the book? ‘

”Well,” I said, looking for an answer, ”I guess I’ll . . . I guess I’ll.
You know, I guess I don’t know.”

”You will,” Nozick replied. ”You will.” And with that we
shook hands and parted company. I have never met anyone who
knew me so well so quickly.

What was I going to do? One thing I knew: I did not want to try
to write another ”big book” on animal rights any time soon. After
mulling things over, three fresh possibilities presented themselves.

First, if I was going to continue to try to make a creative
contribution to the Movement, as a philosopher, I would need to find
new ways of doing so. Second, if I wanted to try to make a
contribution in some other way, I needed to look for new outlets.
Third, if there was something else I could explore, some new creative
challenge that had nothing to do with animal rights, I would have to
discover what this was.

So (to repeat Nozick’s question): what was I going to do? The
answer I reached—the one I have tried to live the past 20 years and
more--was, ”All of the above.”

TOM REGAN, THE HISTORIAN?

One creative challenge required a near total immersion into late
19th and early 20th century English history. It was during these years
that the famous Bloomsbury Group began to take shape and ﬂourish.
Members included Virginia Wolfe and her sister, Vanessa, as well as

years ahead, working with others, I will be searching for ways to
hasten this development. ~

Finally, more writing is still in my blood. Even as I write these
words, I have several essays under way and others in the back of my
mind. Moreover, Empty Cages will need to be revised and updated in
the not too distant future. And there is always that general
introduction to moral philosophy that is brewing in my brain. So, no,
I’m not ready to hang up my keyboard just yet. As for that video
camera—well, that’s another matter altogether.

OTHER WORK

In addition to HQ anthologies in which I erved 1n an edito-
rial capacity I also kept myself busy by writing a
number of essays for a largely professional audience. Some
of these I was able to collect together in a volume of my
own papers, All That Dwell Therein: Essays on Animal
Rights and Environmental Ethics (1982). Whatever their
philosophical shortcomings may be (and they are many),
these essays chart the history of my struggle to find and
articulate a rights-based understanding of the moral ties
that bind us to other animals. The last word is not to be
found in any of these papers. Each is a sketch at best. But
each seems to me now to have been an essential step along
the way to the view I was looking for.

That view is set forth in The Case for Animal Rights
(1983). This work represents the fruit of more than a decade
of hard thinking about the rights of animals. It comes as
close as I she-H- ever come to getting at the deeper truths
on which, 1n my view, the Animal Rights Movement stands
or falls. It is a work of serious, methodical scholarship,
written in the language of philosophy: “direct duties,”
“acquired rights,” “utilitarianism,” the whole lexicon of
academic philosophy. It can be rough going for someone
unfamiliar with the field. But I make no apologies for its

difficulty. Physics is hard. In my View moral philosophy is
harder.

I made every attempt to make the hard ideas I discuss as
accessible as possible. But no amount of effort can make
hard ideas easy. On this score I W by

LIBERATION: OUT FROM UNDER

THE NEED TO SAY MORE

The process of writing The Case was remarkable. I worked
as many as eighteen hours a day for almost a full year, during
which time I again was the fortunate recipient of a Fellow-
ship from the National Endowment for the Humanities. I
am a compulsive rewriter. I doubt if there is a single sentence
in The Case that wasn’t recast at least once. Maybe even
twice. Physically, the work was exhausting. Psychologically,
it was invigorating. I never was tempted to abandon the
project. Once under way I never veered off course. I was
never depressed or displeased about how the book was
going. Each day was too short, not too long. I was absolutely
filled with, and by, the process of writing. I came away from
my year’s work on the book with the conviction that I have
the temperament of a writer. Whether I have any of the
necessary skills is another issue. How lucky those people
are who are able to make an adequate living at this craft.
How courageous are those who try.

There is another point about the process of writing The
Case I should mention. When I started the book I did not
hold the “radical” conclusions I reach in the final chapter.
At the beginning I was against causing animals “unneces-
sary” suffering in scientific research, for example, but I was
not against causing them “necessary” pain. What was
perhaps the most remarkable, exciting part of working on
The Case was how I was led by the force of reasons I had
never before considered to embrace positions I had never
before accepted, including the abolitionist one. The power
of ideas, not my own will, was in control, it seemed to me.
I genuinely felt as if a part of Truth was being revealed to
me for the first time. Qf-eem-se I do not want to claim that
anything like this really happened. Here I am only describ-
ing how I experienced things. And how I experienced them,
especially toward the end of the composition of the book,
was qualitatively unlike anything else I have ever experi-
enced. It was intoxicating. It was as close to anything like
a sustained religious or spiritual revelation as I have ever
experienced. Or am ever likely to experience again.

John Maynard Keynes and Lynton Strachey. The Group was as
renowned for its unconventional behavior as for its brilliance.

Oddly, the Bloomsburies identified the philosopher George
Edward Moore as their chief inspiration. I knew Moore’s philosophy
reasonably well, having written both my Master’s Thesis and part of
my Ph.D. dissertation on his theories. His laborious style of writing
shaped my philosophical voice, as a writer, more than anything else.
Despite this inﬂuence, Moore the man always struck me as more
conventional than brilliant. It seemed wildly improbable to me that
the Moore I knew could have had the inﬂuence the Bloomsburies
attributed to him.

With the luxury of a year’s leave as a fellow at the National
Humanities Center, I set out to find the answer to the riddle before
me. My answer is given in Bloomsbury’s Prophet: G. E. Moore and the
Development of His Moral Philosophy (1987), followed by Moore: The
Early Essays (1988), and G. E. Moore: The Elements of Ethics (1992).
Without my having to say so, these new books said that Tom Regan
was exploring a new line of work, in (of all things) the history of
ideas. It would not be the last time I would embrace a field of study
my disgruntled younger self had rejected.

ROUSING THE SLEEPING GIANT

Some animal rights advocates are openly hostile towards
religion in general, Christianity in particular. It’s not hard to
understand why. Given standard readings of the Bible, animals were
put on earth to satisfy human wants and needs. This is why hogs
fulﬁll their God given destiny by ending up as pieces of bologna
between two slices of bread.

However, this is just one possible reading of scripture, and an
implausible one at that. When God gives humans dominion, we are
given the task of being as loving towards Creation as God was in
creating it in the first place. That’s how I read the opening chapters of
Genesis. I don’t know how anyone can read the words found there
and come away with a different understanding.

To my way of thinking, therefore, everything depends on what
love for Creation comes to. If (as Ibelieve) it makes no sense to kill
those you love, or to make them suffer, or to deprive them of their
full measure of freedom, then the Bible is nothing if not pro animal
rights, whatever others might say to the contrary.

Fortunately, some animal rights advocates agreed, Ethel
Thurston and the late Colin Smith among them. On behalf of the
International Association against Painful Experiments on Animals,

 




0n the Road Again

For those of you who remember The
Animals Voice Magazine, we hope
you’ll welcome us back in this new for—
mat, under our new title: The Animals
Voice Presents. And for those of you
new to The Animals Voice and its
myriad of projects and publications, we
welcome you into our family.

As ﬁnancial support for The Animals
Voice Presents grows—and we sure
hope it does—we’ll broaden its content
scope by including all the things our two
million visitors appreciate about our
web site: timely news, a calendar of
events, action alerts, guest commen—
taries, compelling photography, and the
like. In the meantime, allow us to pre-
sent our ﬁrst topic: “The Life and Times
of Tom Regan.”

I ﬁrst discovered Tom’s work when I
was just out of high school, in a book
titled Animal Rights and Human Obli-
gations, one he co-edited with Peter
Singer. It was such a rare ﬁnd that I
checked it out of the library for weeks at
a time just so I could carry it around
with me and know there was another
animal rights activist somewhere on
planet Earth. The book became my com-
panion, a conduit to my sanity. For, you
see, back in 1977, there wasn’t any such
thing as an animal rights activist, to
speak of, let alone an animal rights
movement.

And sufﬁce it to say, the town I was
living in was a long way from progres—
sive thinking, even for three decades
ago. So it was quite unbelievable, I must
admit, when the California State Univer—
sity, Chico, faculty invited Tom Regan
to visit its campus in the spring of 1987,
some ten years after I’d ﬁrst discovered
that such a man even existed—though
better late than never, I say.

The year before Tom’s arrival, I’d
begun production on a little and a little-
known newsletter Icalled The Animals
Voice. Combining my skills in graphic
design with my passion for animal

defense, I did all I knew to help animals:
educate others about their plight in
human hands and rely on the human
heart to do the rest.

Tom was kind enough to give me an
interview; The Animals Voice was no

 

 

booming publication, and
the article was even
smaller, a short piece on
civil disobedience. But I
scraped up enough dollars
to have a few thousand
printed, and somehow
that put us on the map.
Tom then suggested that I
contact Gil Michaels, an
activist in Los Angeles
who had the funding to
produce the newsletter as
a magazine, but I didn’t

have the courage. I was a
nobody from a small town in northern
California, doing all I knew to do, and I
couldn’t imagine it being worthy of any—
one else’s effort. But Tom had faith in
me even if I didn’t—before I knew it, I
was in the middle of an award—winning,
international full—color animal rights
magazine—and it was full steam ahead.

We went off press in 1997 due to
funding issues, and went online in 2000.
But I can’t get the need to see animal
rights in print out of my system, so here
I am, starting over. I also couldn’t think
of a better way to begin again than to
come full circle: by presenting herewith
the life and times of Tom Regan (in his
own words). If you’re new to animal
rights, his story is an invaluable history
lesson; if you’re a pioneer, you’ll enjoy
the walk down Memory Lane.

And since Tom Regan won’t tell you
this, I will: There wouldn’t be an
Animals Voice without him.

In any of its incarnations.

So, here’s to you, Tom.

The Power of History and

Networking

From the helpless horror of one
nine—year—old girl watching a dog stran—
gled to death only a few yards in front
of her to a web site providing some
5,000 visitors a day with the harsh real—
ities of how animals are treated—and
also providing visitors with thousands
of resources to help animals—the
history of The Animals Voice demon-
strates the power of a single voice and
the exponential—inevitably magical—
power when voices connect.

When nine-year—old Laura Moretti
stood petrified and speechless, that
dog’s cries reached her ears and lodged
in her heart, never to disappear.

At twelve, she began writing short
stories and essays about animals.
People who “loved animals” read them
and just adored them and asked her to
write more. So she did.

At thirteen she tuned into what she
hoped would be a TV special extolling

the beauty of seals, but watched in
horror as a hunter’s boot stomped on a
seal pup until it died, screaming. And
then she wrote about that.

At ﬁfteen she began mimeograph-
ing her essays and, for the next several
years, mailed and faxed them to the
handful of people on earth who were
starting to talk about animal rights—
people who sensed that a movement
was beginning. They listened for
similarities in philosophical, artistic,
legal and educational domains—shar-

 

ing everything they could get their
hands on with everybody they thought
might have a sense of animal rights.

Tom Regan met Laura in her home-
town of Chico, California, when she
was 29. She had been amazed to ﬁnd he
was coming there to give a lecture and
present a ﬁlm on—of all things!—
animal rights.

Gil Michaels was a man whose life
had only recently been altered by his
hearing the cries of animals. Tom
Regan gave Gil Laura’s phone number.
Gil called and—having the ﬁnancial
ability to do so—made her an offer she
couldn’t refuse: to provide beyond—
her-dreams funding for production of
The Animals Voice, publishing it as a
high—gloss, full-color, professionally
researched and marketed publication.

The premiere issue was launched in
the spring of 1988 to the profound
appreciation of animal activists around
the world. Gil generously ﬁnanced the
The Animals Voice Magazine until
1993. After that, Laura and Jeri Lerner
slavishly and devotedly kept the maga-
zine alive and in production until it was
no longer ﬁnancially viable. The last
issue was published in March of 1997.

Realizing the dynamic potential and
unbelievable reach of the Internet,
Laura taught herself web design with a

Ethel and Colin invited me to organize and chair a major 1984
conference on religion and animals. In 1986, I was privileged to
publish the proceedings under the title Animal Sacrifices: Religious
Perspectives on the Use of Animals in Science, which I dedicated to
Colin, whose premature death in 2002 was a great loss to the animal
rights movement and to his many friends.

The year after the London conference, with the support of
Claire and Bill Allan, among others, I was able to write and direct a
half hour film, We Are All Noah. A variety of religious traditions are
represented but Judaism and Christianity are dominant. Topics
covered include animal agriculture, the fur industry, and vivisection.
Although the film does not dwell on the horrible things being done to
animals, it shows enough to suggest the dimensions of the abuse.
When the film won a Silver Medal at the 1985 International Film
Festival of New York, everyone involved in its production thought
we finally had a teaching aid that would rouse the sleeping giant of
organized religion. It did not take long for us to realize that we
should have thought again. Here’s an example of what we learned.

Dietrich von Haugwitz has been a dear friend for the better part
of three decades. Working with other members of the North Carolina
Network for Animals, Dietrich found a place where Noah could be
shown. Hundreds of invitations were sent to clergy in the area even
as the event was publicized in other ways. A lovely spread of meat-
free finger food was prepared. And (as has always been true of
anything he does) Dietrich had composed a first-rate introduction to
the film.

80 there we all were, gathered together, waiting for the first
arrivals. And there we sat, waiting. And waiting. And waiting. Will it
surprise anyone when I say, ”No one came”? It surprised all of us, no
one more so than a crestfallen Dietrich. One thing was certain: it
would take a lot more hard work, involving many more people, to
rouse the sleeping giant. Happily, the past 20 years have witnessed
many positive changes, much of them spurred on by the ﬁne work of
writers like Keith Akers, Daniel Dombroski, I. R. Hyland, Roberta
Kalechofsky, Gary Kowalski, Andrew Linzey, and Richard Schwartz.

TALK, TALK, TALK

Publication of The Case opened new doors. Invitations to
present lectures on campuses, give speeches at rallies, and read
papers before professional meetings increased. I’ve never kept an
exact record of when and where I have spoken; all I know is that,
whether for good or ill, I’ve done a lot of talking.

 




IFE AND

TIMES OF TOM

 

 

es that remain have been boarded up,
condemned by the city as uninhabitable.

When I drive through the neighbor—
hood today, grown silent and all but
deserted, I am a ghost in a ghost town.
No one from my youth remains.

 

Viewing the fading shrouds of what was
once a vibrant neighborhood, where VJ
Day and the Fourth of July were cele—
brated with patriotic fervor, where Jews
mixed with gentiles, whites with blacks,
every nationality with every other, no
one would believe that there once were
people here who loved these streets and
narrow alleyways, the hard cement
porches and creaking swings, the wood-
en steps winding to the hills above. But
love it I did. It always saddens me to see
the stilled emptiness “progress” has left
in its wake.

As a kid of the streets, the animals I
knew were mostly the animals of the
streets. Mainly cats and dogs but there
were horses, too. In those days vendors
and junkmen rode four—wheeled wagons
through the city, pulled by stoop-shoul-
dered, weary creatures who were occa-
sionally aroused from their dolorous
fatigue by the high pitched clang of a
trolley’s bell or the crack of the driver’s
whip.

Tippy was another matter. One hun-
dred percent mutt, she was an energetic,
tri-colored wisp of a dog with a small but

 

clear tip of white at the very end of her
tail. She was eager for affection and
designed by nature to be free. Give her
just the slightest crack in the gate and
powl—she was gone! Like a shot she was
through the gate and around the corner.

I understand now that she lacked the
space she needed to be the dog she was.
Still, Tippy did not want for warm
human companionship. My fondest
memory of her is when, wonder of won—
ders, thirty-six inches of snow fell on
Pittsburgh in a matter of a few days.
That kind of development suspends all
the ordinary rules of behavior. Tippy
spent long hours free to wander and
play. She knew a good time when she
had one. Some photographs of those
days remain. It is hard to tell who is
happiest—Tippy or me.

EXCURSIONS: THE COUNTRY

Not everything was urban in my
youth. Along with my parents and sister
I enjoyed fishing along the upper
Allegheny River. We also visited friends
who had farms. Sometimes I stayed on
for a day, maybe a weekend, occasion-
mWawwk

The farm I knew best was small,
devoted mainly to vegetables and ﬂow-
ers. In the winter, plants were grown in
a long, low-slung greenhouse. It was
bewildering to enter that luminous
space, quiet as a church, feel the accu-
mulated heat of the sun on a bitterly cold
day and smell the sometimes dank,
sometimes sweet odors of the plants.
Without a doubt these were the most
mysterious, most awesome moments of
my youth, occasions when my experi—
ence was so full of inchoate meaning
that I could not then, and cannot now,
ﬁnd the words to describe it. It was, I
think, more a yearning than a fact I felt.

My guess is, many people of my
generation had a farm like this in their
childhood. Back then, families took
drives in the country on Sundays; farms
were places people visited. Urban kids
of my time and place were bred and

ﬁr?

In the early years, my stump speech was ”Animal Rights,
Human Wrongs.” Without having to think new thoughts, I was able
to introduce audiences to the central philosophical issues deﬁning the
animal rights debate. The response that greeted my scholarly
ruminations sometimes was surprising. Here are two examples.

The philosophers at one university invited me to their campus.
In the months leading up to my lecture, local and national animal
rights groups had targeted the work of campus researchers who were
doing ghastly experiments on nonhuman primates. You could feel
the tension in the air.

When I arrived at the room where I was scheduled to speak, the
overﬂow crowd blocked my way. New arrangements were quickly
made: I would speak to a standing room only audience in a large
auditorium. Before entering, I was taken aside and introduced to the
head of campus security. He would be sitting in the middle of the
front row. If things got out of hand, he would wink at me and mouth
the words, ”Head for the nearest exit!”

So there he was, in the front row, looking at me with a wide-
eyed intensity. I’m sure everyone has had the experience of doin
one thing even as we are thinking about another. That’s how things
were for me. I was covering familiar philosophical ground: moral
standing, indirect duties and so on, while, in the back of my mind, I
was thinking, ”Just wait ’til I get to Kant’s categorical imperative:
that’s when all hell will break loose!” Needless to say, when I got to
Kant, all hell did not break loose.

On another occasion, all hell broke loose before I arrived.
Faculty who did research on animals were enraged that I would be
invited to their campus. Letters of protest were circulated in which I
was described as a dangerous zealot, a firebrand, and a rabble-
rousing demagogue. The researchers likened me to Hermann Goring
and to monomaniacal mental patients who think they are Jesus Christ
or Napoleon; one spokesperson even went so far as to call me the Jim
Jones of the animal rights movement.

As for my public lectures, the researchers accused me of
advocating violence; spreading lies; of being anti-science, anti-
rational, and anti-intellectual; of asserting that I have the right to
impose by violent means my notion of ethics on others; and of
inﬂaming my audiences to commit unlawful acts.

Warming to the occasion, other faculty chimed in by asserting
that I was the "point man" for laboratory break-ins (I visited a
campus, gave a talk, packed my bags, and the next day the Animal
Liberation Front trashed a lab and liberated the animals). Oh, and

small grant from Sudhir Amembal, a
former Board President and Animals
Voice Magazine supporter. In 2000,
they created and launched Animals
Voice Online: www.animalsvoice.com.

The reason for telling you this
abbreviated history of The Animals
Voice is to remind you of the impact of
one voice, one lecture, one phone call.

The premiere issae of The Animals
Voice Magazine was laancherl in
the spring of 1988 to the profoanrl
appreciation of animal rights

activists aroanol the worlol.

 

Stated that way, it probably doesn't
inspire excitement or enthusiasm or a
life—altering awakening.

And this is the point.

Excitement and enthusiasm and
life—altering awakenings may happen
when we are alone and listening to our
own voice. But we all really know that
magic happens, that differences get
made, that paradigms shift, when our
voices are in concert
with the voices of
other human beings.

Whenever you
doubt the ability of
one individual to
make a difference, re-
member the powerless
nine—year-old girl who
created a vehicle that
empowers and sup-
ports thousands of
people every day—
day after day, year
after year.

When you hesitate
to go to one more
meeting because you’re

 

anyway, remember Laura going to hear
Tom Regan’s presentation.

When you meet someone on the
street or over the phone or via the
Internet and hesitate to speak of this
great person or this fantastic project
that matters to you, remember that Tom
called Gil.

Having taken on the Herculean task
of creating a world free of animal
cruelty, discouragement is inevitable.
And, a friend once advised me to
“never underestimate the inevitability
of gradualness.” If each of us takes
action, and then we work with each
other, our success will be inevitable.

If you are reading this, then you are
someone who is and has been a voice
for animals. And too bad for whatever
your opinions may be about you, you
are hereby profoundly acknowledged
for having been heard, for having got—
ten through, for having altered peoples’
relationships with animals.

And in doing that, you are causing a
world that works for everyone and
everything, with no one and nothing
left out.

Thank you for being the animals’
voice.

BEGINNINGS: A KID OF THE STREETS

I was born and raised in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania—“the Burgh” as we who
have lived there call it. Although I have
not had a permanent residence there for
more than forty years I still consider
Pittsburgh my home. The Burgh sets its
roots deep in those who have known it.
The City gets in your blood. You can’t
go away from home again.

The house where I spent the ﬁrst

Tbe bamaa mind is remarkable for
its ability to see tbe world in bits and
pieces, like an expansive vista viewed
tbroagb tbe riarrmv slits of a picket
fence.

 

ﬁfteen years of my life fronted Califor—
nia Avenue, a busy thoroughfare on the
city’s North Side: three lanes of trafﬁc,
two trolley lines. It could get hectic. We
never played ball on California Avenue.
Beyond the trafﬁc there was a sharp
drop to a leveled space some ﬁfteen feet
below the street. A dozen train tracks
sliced their way to the horizon. You
could not see the trains, either from the
street or from the second story windows
of our house. But their relentless pres—
ence was the most dominant aspect of
daily life.

This was before diesel engines.
Everything was steam. That means coal—
powered. The air was ﬁlled with great
plumes of grayish white smoke and
phosphorescent Cinders that glowed in
the night air. Passenger and freight trains
hurried by, their whistles wailing
throughout the day and all the night.
Everywhere there was the crashing
sound of cars being coupled and uncou—
pled on the Hump. Great lines of cars,
hundreds at a time—freight and oil,
ﬂatbeds and cattleewere strung togeth-

er by the skilled workmen. Twenty—four
hours a day, seven days a week, every
day of every month, you heard the sound
of heavy metal.

Everyone who lived along this
sprawling artery that linked the coal-
mines of West Virginia to the steel mills
of Pittsburgh belonged to the railroad.
This was true even when, as in my fam-
ily’s case, no one worked for it. The soot
and smoke invaded your eyes and ears,
your nose and mouth, the elastic around
your underwear and the clothes in your
dresser. When you took a bath, a black
ring remained in the tub after you
drained it, a reminder, lest one forget—
how could one?—of the clanging world
outside. My neighborhood was a child’s
paradise, a place where a kid could luX—
uriate in the steamy dirt of industrial
urban living.

That neighborhood is all but gone
now. The house where I was raised has
been demolished. In fact the entire small
block of houses now is an open ﬁeld,
full of weeds and wildﬂowers. Even the
railroad is all but idle. Most of the hous-

done at a head injury laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania.
The tape revealed numerous violations of federal guidelines and
presented the researchers as uncaring, sometimes even sadistic.
Funded by the National Institutes of Health, the research had been
going on for years and was headed nowhere.

The stolen tapes somehow ended up in the hands of Ingrid
Newkirk and Alex Pacheco, of People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals. ”Unnecessary Fuss,” a 26 minute video, summarized what
was happening. The case against the lab was incontestable. So what
did the funding agency do? Like spitting in the eyes of Animal Rights
Advocates everywhere, NIH increased the funding. It was time to
act.

On the evening of July 14, 101 ARAs gathered at a motel not far
from the NIH. Each of us had a ”buddy” (mine was Bobbie Wright, a
wonderful ARA from Arizona). Plans were sketched. Every one of us
knew what we were supposed to do. And when.

To this day I still remember walking into Building 31-B on the
NIH campus, meeting Bobbie in the cafeteria, taking an elevator to
the top ﬂoor, then (at the appointed time) descending stairs and
entering the funding office. Mind you: Bobbie and I were not the only
folks who entered at that time. All 101 ARAs showed up there, like a
hurricane making landfall.

Once crushed inside, we did this really radical thing. We sat
down, some in chairs, most on the ﬂoor. Then we started to chant, at
the top of our lungs, ”What do we want? Animal rights! When do we
want them? Now!” Our entrance was so unanticipated, our presence
so undeniable, and our volume so loud, that the staff in that ofﬁce
were in total shock. If a giant boulder had fallen through the roof, it
would have made more sense to them than our being there. As we
chanted ever more enthusiastically, we all thought the same thing.
We figured the police would be there any minute.

But the police were nowhere to be found as, first one, then
another staff person left. Then other people in other offices were seen
leaving until, to our surprise, the entire eighth ﬂoor had been
vacated. Without having set out to do so, the intrepid ARAs were in
charge of thousands of square feet of federal government property.

Our occupation lasted 4 days during which time some of the
original participants had to leave, the air conditioning was turned
down to artic temperatures (some NIH officials got the idea they
could freeze us out), and the media and members of congress
actually began to pay attention to why we were there.

Tom Regan and
Peter Gerard
inspire tens of
thousands of
activists at the
1990 March for
the Animals in
Washington, D. C.

Off we started. We knew there were
a lot of people but still couldn’t get a
sense of the numbers until...until there
were still marchers turning on to Penn—
sylvania Avenue, all the way back at
the White House, as the people at the
head of the march were beginning to
sit down in front of our nation’s
Capitol!

Estimates ranged from 30,000 to
100,000 marchers. No one will ever
know the exact number. Believe me, I
was not the only one with tears in my
eyes on that day. Such a mass of human
compassion the world had never seen
before. Or, sadly, has not seen since. In

 

 

 

 

 

1996, when a second march was
organized, fewer than 3,000 people
participated.

CHANGING TIMES

Something happened to the animal
rights movement in the siX years
between the two marches. I don’t think
anyone fully understands why. I know I
don’t.

Everyone who marched in 1990
could feel a kinship with everyone else.
We were united. We spoke and acted as
one. I mean, we all felt that our move—
ment, the Animal Rights Movement,
was going to take off!

Things did not turn out that way.
Instead of growing more uniﬁed, more
focused, more powerful, the years after
the ﬁrst march witnessed increasing
movement fragmentation often accom-
panied by bickering and back—biting.
And whereas, in the years leading up to
the ﬁrst march, new people were enter—
ing the movement in unprecedented
numbers, by the time of the second
march unprecedented numbers of tried
and true activists, people who had made
a major commitment to animal rights,
were leaving.

Don’t get me wrong. Important
things continued to be done, both by
grassroots activists and by the big
national organizations. But things were
not the same. That fragile feeling of
unity was broken. Veterans of the strug—
gle couldn’t help noticing that some of
the wind had gone out of our sails.

I was not immune to these changes.
Although I continued to write papers
and give lectures, I did less rather than
more. Instead I turned to my old neme-
sis, history, to take my understanding of
animal rights to a deeper level.

Animal rights activists are fond of
saying that our movement is like other
“radical” movements. But is it? How
could I give an informed answer without
being informed? And how could I be
informed if I failed to explore the history
of our movement as well as the others?
Once the question was asked this

raised on the machine, but we took

commerce with the garden.

Some children understand early on
what meat is. They realize that a roast or
a pork chop or a chicken leg is a piece of
dead animal. A corpse. I was not that

 

 

 

 

precocious. Like most Americans I grew
up unmindful of the food on my plate
and the death of the creature it repre—
sents. The animals I knew personally,
Tippy for one, I considered my friends.
But I lacked the imagination then to
make the connection between my fond-
ness for these animals and the silent
pieces of ﬂesh that came from my moth-
er’s skillet or oven. The human mind is
remarkable for its ability to see the
world in bits and pieces, each part dis—
connected from the rest, like an expan-
sive vista viewed through the narrow
slits of a picket fence. It was not until
much later in my life that the force of
logic and the vicissitudes of experience
overwhelmed the chronic idleness of my
1mag1nation.

TRANSITION: THE BURBS

Had my family remained on the
North Side it is virtually certain that I
would never have gone to college.
People in that neighborhood grew up to
work, not to study. My parents were
products of that pattern. Neither ﬁnished

the ninth grade. There was work to be
done. Mouths to be fed. Education was a
luxury. My parents were unable to pay
the price.

My sister was different: She gradu—
ated from high school. But then the pat—
tern took hold again. She went directly
from the classroom to the workforce. A
much better student than I was and
natively much smarter, she was certain
to have had a distinguished university
career had she had the opportunity. And
I? I was destined to follow my sister’s
lead. The duty of work called. It was not
a matter of whether but where to get
down to the task of making a living.

But then a momentous thing hap—
pened: We moved. To the suburbs. My
parents decided that they had had it.
That grime—ﬁlled heaven of my boyhood
had been their hell for too long. We were
getting out! No ifs, ands, or buts. And I?
I was ﬁfteen, with deep roots in the
friendships and places of my youth. If
ever a child was resentful and full of
anger, these powerful emotions found a
home in me. I was determined to be
unhappy.

The world did not cooperate with my
resolve. In the end, the move was not as
traumatic as I was bent on making it. I
made new friends and soon found
myself a part of a quite different envi-
ronment. Many of my friends’ parents
had gone to college. They had profes-
sions—in medicine, the law, education.
Their taste for culture trickled down to
their children and, through them, to me.
I soon found myself reading and talking
about Camus and Andre Gide, dis-
cussing Nietzsche and Norman Mailer,
listening to Bartok and Stravinsky. With
my companions I drove into and around
the Burgh to watch foreign and classic
ﬁlms. We debated God’s existence and
free will into the morning hours. For the
ﬁrst time in my life I began to write.
Horrible ﬁction. Worse poetry. But I
took the demands of the Muse seriously.
And my teachers liked it. They told me I
was a writer-in-the-making.

clearly, there clearly was no escaping
the answer.

I spent the better part of ﬁve years
reading everything I could about the
most important struggles for human jus—
tice. The Native American Struggle. The
African-American Struggle. The
Women’s Struggle. The Gay/Lesbian

tion to Animal Experimentation: Good
or Bad? (2002), and Animal Rights,
Human Wrongs: An Introduction to
Moral Philosophy (2003). Even as this
work was published, as far back as
1997, I worked on two other books, one
a general introduction to moral theory
(still maturing somewhere in my brain)

Struggle. I took what I was learning to
the classroom, exposing both under-
graduate and graduate students to mate-
rial they knew no better than I did.
Student’s lives were changed by what
they discovered. Mine was too.

Here are two important things I
learned. Any time some people (the
“Ins”) want to exploit other ‘inferior’
people (the “Outs”), the Ins will always
have two powerful forces on their side:
One will be organized religion (the
“church”); the other, the ‘best’ science
of the day. Both will say (in their author-
itative voices): The Ins really are better
than the Outs. Our sacred books say so.
So do our esteemed scientists. So,
what’s to complain? The Outs are
exactly where they belong. Under the
boot of the Ins.

So (we ask): Is the struggle for
animal rights really like other struggles
for social justice? Unquestionably. All
we have to do is identify our common
enemies. I have history to thank for
teaching me that.

FINDING A NEW VOICE

The past four years have been
uncommonly productive and rewarding.
A collection of my essays, Defending
Animal Rights, appeared in 2000, fol-
lowed by my contribution to The Animal
Rights Debate (2001), another contribu-

 

and another, for the general reader
(which took too many wrong turns and
has been abandoned). It was not until
August of 2002 that something dramatic
happened, don’t ask me why. But hap-
pen it did.

It was my habit at this time to go to
my ofﬁce in the library and spend ﬁve or
six hours working on the two books I
just mentioned. (I had retired from the
North Carolina State faculty in January
2001 and had time on my hands.)
Sometime in August, another book
asserted itself. I mean this quite literally.

I was not the only one with tears in
my eyes on that play. Saeh a mass of
haman compassion the world had
never seen hefore.

 

The new book took charge of my life, in
ways analogous to what happened when
I wrote The Case for Animal Rights.
Only this time, the writing was not easy.
This time, the process of writing was
sheer agony. I have never worked so
hard on anything in my life. I under-
stood why, but that didn’t help.

The “why” was simple. I was trained
to write the way those I studied wrote.
George Edward Moore, for one, than
whom no more plodding writer can be

Animals,’ 1990.

conceived. This (the Moorean) voice
was how I put words on the page when—
ever I sat down to do any “serious” writ—
ing. The demons behind the new book
would not hear of it. Moore’s ponder—
ous, analytic style was to be silenced. A
new voice was to be heard. The only
problem was, the old Tom Regan was
standing in the way.

So each day I went to my office.
Each day the old voice fought to be
heard. And each day this new voice
refused to cooperate. The contest lasted
nine months, the length of an average
pregnancy, before Empty Cages: Facing
the Challenge of Animal Rights was ﬁn—
ished. Reading its chatty, conversational
tone, you would think it had to be a
much easier book to write than The Case
for Animal Rights. In fact, just the oppo-
site is true; the latter wrote itself; the
former was like getting blood from a
turnip.

Paradoxically, however, when I look
back on the process of writing, Empty
Cages today seems like another gift
given to me, only this time from some
other source. I am so grateful that I was
able to bring it to fruition. Easy to read,
if not to write, I harbor the hope that it
will reach a much larger audience than
The Case and that, in combination with
the work of others, it will help revitalize
the animal rights movement, returning it
to that magical time between the 1985
occupation of the NIH and the glorious
day when tens of thousands of animal
rights activists marched down Pennsyl-
vania Avenue.

FOOTPRINTS ‘

Except for two years at the begin-
ning of my professional life, my home
has been North Carolina State Univer—
sity. The University has been good to
me, in many ways. Although I was an
outspoken proponent of animal rights on
a campus where students take degrees in
animal agriculture and where hundreds
of faculty use animals in their research,
I was never punished or threatened for
speaking my mind.

Just the opposite. The University has
honored my work, presenting me with
every award for teaching and research
for which I was eligible, culminating in
receipt of the William Alexander Quarles
Medal, the highest honor the University
can bestow on one of its faculty.

Torlay, 0a the eve of my 66th hirth-
clay, I am fast as committed, if riot
more so, to liheratirtg animals from
the clatches of hamart tyrartrty than
I was more than thirty years ago.

 

As rewarding as these awards have
been, I have the North Carolina State
University Library to thank for my
greatest honor. This is the Tom Regan
Animal Rights Archive, inaugurated in
2001, when, in response to the Library’s
invitation, I donated my papers, cover—
ing the whole of my personal and pro—
fessional life. Since its founding, the
Archive has grown dramatically, thanks
to major additions from The Animal
Rights Network, among others. Even
today the Archive is the premiere repos-
itory of animal rights material in the
world. On a personal note, the Archive is
a lifeline to the future. The Tom Regan
Animal Rights Archive will be at North
Carolina State University as long as
there is a North Carolina State Univer-
sity. For generations to come, the
Archive, like a footprint, will attest to
my having passed this way.

The same is true, in another way,
now that our children have married and
have children of their own. There’s
something of my genes, and Nancy’s
too, in Brooke, Hannah, Anna Drew and
our grandchildren yet to be born. They,
too, attest to our having passed this way.
Such joy they and their parents bring to
our lives; so many blessings; too many
to count.

Talk of footprints might create the
impression that I think my work is done.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Today, on the eve of my 66th birthday, I

am just as committed, if not more so, to
liberating animals from the clutches of
human tyranny than I was more than
thirty years ago, when I ﬁrst began to
think about the issues. Aristotle is reput-
ed to have said (I’ve never been able to
ﬁnd where he says this), “There are no
boy philosophers.” I think this means
that we have to experience the world and
smooth off the rough corners of our
personal identity before we can do our
best work. My principal inﬂuence, the
philosopher Immanuel Kant, is a case in
point; he did not do his most creative
thinking until he was in his sixties. I like
to think the same is true in my case: the
better, the more creative, the more pro—
ductive days are ahead.

So (in response to Robert Nozick’s
question, asked some twenty years ago):
“Now what will you do?”

My answer has been, and will
remain: “All of the above.”

NATURE REBELS: UNDERSTANDING
WEAKNESS

Probably everyone who reﬂects on
the life he or she has lived up to a given
point in time is struck by how chancy it
all seems. Consider my case. Suppose
my family had never moved from
Pittsburgh’s North Side: Would I have
gone to college? Very unlikely. But
even if I had, would I have gone to
Thiel College? More unlikely still. And
that means that in all probability I
would not have met either Nancy or
Bob Bryan.

How very unlikely then, that I
would have gone to the University of
Virginia to study philosophy. Or grown
into the person who wrote The Case for
Animal Rights. I can never think of my
past without being overwhelmed by how
much of what has happened to me (and
this includes the very best things) was
due to factors quite beyond my control.
I try to remember this when I meet peo—
ple whose ideas and values differ signif—
icantly from my own. “There but for a
series of contingencies go I,” I think.

This helps me in my battle against

self-righteousness. And in my efforts to
be patient with people who are just
entering the Movement as well as those
who are currently outside it. How little
of what we are and what we will become
is within our power to control.

And so it is that I look back uncer—
tainly at that self I once was. I see the
boy playing on Pittsburgh’s streets,
unmindful of the aged, mistreated mare
pulling an overloaded wagon of junk
and old iron, the whip whistling angrily
over her weary head. I watch the teen—
ager running his hands over a butchered
side of beef without giving it a second
thought. I observe the aspirant Virginia
Gentleman listening indifferently to
another’s anguish concerning a solitary
dog used in practice surgery, his own
mind preoccupied with loftier worries
about Plato’s theory of Forms. And in
every case I wonder, not superﬁcially
but down to the very depths of my being,
if there is not the slightest hint, the most
miniscule portent, of what my future
was to be. Is it all a matter of luck? Of
chance? Was there nothing in me that
directed my growth from within?

There is, perhaps, one hint of my
destiny all but hidden in the blur of my
boyhood memories. I was born with
what has come to be called a “lazy” or

 

 

 

 

 

“weak” eye. Other names for my con-
dition are “cock—eyed” or “cross—eyed.”
Corrective surgery, which is now routine
for young children, was not in vogue
back then. What was recommended
were exercises, and these were done
with the aid of a mechanical device at
the ophthalmologist’s ofﬁce.

The device was constructed as

it?

When, on the morning of July 19, 1985, the remaining civil
disobedients marched out of Building 31-B, the funding for the lab
having been withdrawn, we all felt that animal rights was a force to
be reckoned with. None among us could doubt that we had seized
the offensive, that there would be no stopping us now. Five years
later, this same feeling of robust conﬁdence would reassert itself
again, only multiplied more than a thousand fold.

”ONWARD AR SOLDIERS!”

Gwyneth Snyder, Diana Basehart, and a handful of other
California ARAs deserve credit for formulating the idea. Scores of
others deserve credit for helping implement it. Everyone agreed: the
time had come to ﬂex our muscles. We were going to march on
Washington!

As plans evolved, I was asked to co-chair the March with Peter
Garad, who was then the head of the National Alliance for Animals.
This does not mean that we shared the work equally. Peter did far
more than I did when it came to the details: advertising the event,
getting the necessary permits, crafting a program, and so on. My
main jobs were to help raise funds and to motivate ARAs to
participate. The latter was much easier than the former.

When the day of the march dawned, all the Regans wandered
down to the assembly area, in Lafayette Park. We didn’t know what
to expect. We were just hoping we would not be among the few on
hand. We were not.

Huge banners waived in the wind for each of the states.
Huddled around each banner were ﬂags identifying all the groups
from the several states, sometimes (in the case of Alaska, for
example) a handful, sometimes (for California and New York), a
truckful).

This was one noisy family reunion! Music could be heard at
every turn. Some folks were singing, others chanting. Vendors were
selling everything that had anything to do with animal rights, from
soy dogs to belt buckles.

Off we started. We knew there were a lot of people but you
couldn’t get a sense of the numbers until . . . until there were still
marchers turning on to Pennsylvania Avenue, all the way back at the White
House, as the people at the head of the march were beginning to sit down in
front of our nation’s Capitol! Maybe as many as 100,00 people!

Believe me, I was not the only one with tears in my eyes on that
day. Such a mass of human compassion the world had never seen

follows: If you looked through the right
lens, you saw a bird. And if you looked
through the left lens, you saw a cage.
People with normal eyes who looked
through both lenses at the same time
saw the bird imposed on the cage, which
gave the appearance that the bird was in
the cage. I saw things differently. In my

My natare wonla not perrnit me to
see the hirol in the cage. Sornething in
me rebelled against seeing things this
way. Others saw the hire! as captive.
I eonla only see the hira as free.

 

case, because of my weak left eye, the
bird always appeared to the right and
slightly below the cage. Sometimes,
when I concentrated as hard as I could,
the bird seemed to move closer to the
cage. But try as I might I never could see
the bird in the cage.

Today, thinking back on what at the
time appeared to be a serious failure on
my part, I glimpse the one deeply mys—
terious suggestion of where I was head-
ed with my life, the one possible portent
of what I would—and must—become.
Try as I might my nature would not per-
mit me to see the bird in the cage.
Something in me rebelled against seeing
things this way. Others saw the bird as
captive. I could only see the bird as free.
And that, in its way, is a prophetic
metaphor of what I have become.

My fate, one might say, is to help
others see animals in a different way——
as creatures who do not belong in cages.
Or in leghold traps. Or in skillets.
Perhaps, indeed, there is in everyone a
natural longing to help free animals
from the hands of their oppressors—a
longing only waiting for the right oppor—
tunity to assert itself. I like to think in
these terms when I meet people who are
not yet active in the Animal Rights
Movement. Like Socrates I see my role
in these encounters as being that of the
midwife, there to help the birth of an
idea already alive, just waiting to be
delivered.

I have some sense that this was true
in my case; the early evidence is there in
my natural inability to see the bird in the
cage. And yet how long it took for the
idea contained in that “failure” to be
born!

When viewed in this way, and not-
withstanding the painful evidence to
the contrary—the many instances of
my own indifference to animal suffer—
ing, some of which I have been obliged
to confess on this occasion—when
viewed in this way I think I sense that
all has not been chance or accident in
my life. When viewed in this way I see
that the child I was is the father of the
man I have become. I have found my
proper destiny. My reason for being. Or
perhaps this has been given to me.
Maybe Reverend Fackler was right
after all. X

Oi? course, when you have a book pn‘biished, you can‘t heir) hoping for
f‘avorais’ie reviews, written by reaiiy important peopie, pnbiished in higniy
prestigious pieces. Fortunately, like Case enjoyed a number of snail
responses. One. in. particniar, written by the iate. Robert Noziek, had an
interesting air'teriife,

Ae it happened, Noziek and Tenth attended the same philosophy
conference in December 1.983. At this time Noziek was among the three or
{our most infineniiai morai phiioeopixers in the worid, so it was with. some
trepidation. ”that, spotting him, i introduced. myaeif.

iie eonio. not have been nicer. i-ie was warm, and. ettnswe in hie praise.
”There‘s inst one thing; i want in know," he said. Drawing me eioeer, he
asked, Nine wiiai: are you going to rio’?"

‘i/‘Jitinrmt having; may reaiiaeri ii, ibis narration had. been gnawing away at
me ever since i finished The Case i mean, what was i going to do now thaii
had emptied inyseif of {-nieryining that went into the book?

”i-‘i’e‘iif i sairi, iooieing for an answer, "i gness i‘ii...i' guess i’ii. You know, i
guess i don’t know."

"Yon wiii,” Nozicia: repiied. "You wiii." And with that we shook hands and
parted company. i have never met anyone who knew me so weii so
qnickiy.

What was i going to do? {fine thing i knew: i did not want to try to write
another "big book" on animai rights any time soon. After inniiing things
over, three .treeii possibiii’nes presented themseivea

First, if i Rivas going to continue to try to make a contribution to the
ix/‘ioveineni, as a phiioaopher, i wonioi need to find nei; 7 ways of. doing a .i
Second, if i wanted to try to make a contribution in. some other way, i
need ed to iooir for oerv 7 ontiets. Third, if "there was something eise i conici
expiore, some new creative ei‘iaiienge that are. nothing to do with animai
rights, 3. woniti have to discover what this waa.

So {in repeat Moments question}: what “wee i going~ to do? The answeri
reaei‘sed m the one i. have tried in ﬁve the past 29 years and in ore m was,
"Aii of the above."

before. Or, sadly, has not seen since. In 1996, when a second march
was organized, fewer than 3,000 people participated.

HIGH TIMES, AND LOW

Something happened to the animal rights movement in the six
years between those two marches. I don’t think anyone fully
understands why. I know I don’t. But beyond any doubt, the
movement peaked in 1990, after which it went into a collective funk.

People who had lived and breathed animal rights up to 1990,
quietly left, one after another. As our numbers dwindled, so did the
enthusiasm of those who stayed the course. Don’t get me wrong.
Important things continued to get done, both by grass roots activists
and by the big national organizations. But things were not the same.
To any veteran of the struggle, you couldn’t help noticing that the
movement had gone from high times to low.

I was not immune to these changes. Although I continued to
write papers and give lectures, I did less rather than more. Instead I
turned to my old nemesis, history, to take my understanding of
animal rights to a deeper level.

ARAs are fond of saying that our movement is like other
”radical” movements. But is it? Is it really like the struggle for
women’s rights? For civil rights? How could I give an informed
answer without being informed? And how could I be informed if I
failed to explore the history of our movement as well as the others?
Once the question was asked this clearly, there clearly was no
escaping the answer.

I spent the better part of 5 years reading everything I could
about the most important struggles for human justice. The Native
American Struggle. The African American Struggle. The Women’s
Struggle. The Gay / Lesbian Struggle. I took what I was learning to the
classroom, exposing both undergraduate and graduate students to
material they knew no better than I did. Student’s lives were changed
by what they discovered. Mine was too.

Here are the main things I learned. Any time some people (the
”Ins”) want to exploit other ’inferior’ people (the ”Outs”), the Ins will
always have two powerful forces on their side. One will be organized
religion (the ”church”); the other, the ’best’ science of the day. Both
will say (in their authoritative voice): The Ins really are better than
the Outs. Our sacred books say so. So do our esteemed scientists. So,
what’s to complain? The Outs are exactly where they belong. Under
the boot of the Ins.

the City as uninhabitable. When I drive through the old
neighborhood today, grown silent and all but deserted, I
am a ghost in a ghost-town. No one from my youth remains.
Viewing the fading shrouds of what was once a vibrant
neighborhood, where V] Day and the Fourth of July were
celebrated with patriotic fervor, where Jews mixed with
gentiles, whites with blacks, every nationality with every
other, no one would believe that there once were people
here who loved these streets and narrow alleyways, the hard
cement porches and creaking swings, the wooden City Steps
winding to the hills above — those Steps where we kids
spent Friday nights fantasizing about what we would do
before and after the ten cent double feature at the Brighton
Show on Saturday mornin 5. But 10 e it I did. It alwa s
saddens me when I makegm'yS agﬁéSpﬂgrimage and sele
again the stilled emptiness “progress” has created.

As a kid of the streets,§the animals I knew were mostly
the animals of the streets.) Cats and dogs for the most part.
But there were rats about — huge, menacing creatures that
darted through the twisting alleys at night, their wild red
eyes ablaze if caught in a beam of light. These were
Pittsburgh rats — creatures who could eat through a plaster
wall of an evening’s diversion. And there were also horses.
In those days vendors and junkmen rode four-wheeled wa—

fell on d a ears in my case, blending as they did with the

Tippy was another matter. ne undred percent mutt,
she was an energetic blank/ isp of a dog with a small but
clear tip of white at the very end of her tail. She was eager
for affection and designed by nature to be free. Give her
just the slightest crack in the gate and pow! —- she was
gone! Like a shot she was through the gate and around the
corner. Her favorite adventure during these escapades was
to roll ecstatically in the horse dung. What deep longing
this primordial ritual fulfilled I do not know. But it was
Nirvana for her while it lasted. I understand now that she
lacked the space she needed to be the dog she was, and I
see the shadow of her stunted life in those mournful looks
on so many city dogs who live in close quarters. Still, Tippy
did not want for warm human companionship. My fondest
memory of her is when, wonder of wonders, thirty-six inches
of snow fell on Pittsburgh in a matter of a few days. That
kind of development suspends all the ordinary rules of be-
havior. Tippy spent long hours free to wander and play, and
most of this time she spent with me and the other neighbor-
hood kids. She knew a good time when she had one. Some
photographs of those days remain. It is hard to tell who is

I’ll happiest —— Tippy or 1%.

EXCURSIONS: THE COUNTRY

Not everything was urban in my youth. Along with my
parents and sister I enjoyed fishing along the upper Al-
legheny River and berry and nut picking in the country.
We also visited friends who had farms. Sometimes I stayed
on after my parents and sister returned home; for a day,

visits I lived with the farm, assaulted by the pun ent odor

vegetables and flowers. In the winter plants were grown in
a long, low-slung green house. It was bewildering to enter
that luminousspace, quiet as a church, feel the accumulated
heat of the sun on a bitterly cold day and smell the some—
times dank, sometimes sweet odors of the plants. Without
a doubt these were the most mysterious, most awesome
moments of my youth, occasions when my experience was
so full of inchoate meaning] that I could not then, and
cannot now, find the words to describe it. It was, I think,
more a yearning than a fact I felt.

The few animals my parents’ farming friends had were
members of the extended family. They gave, and the others
took — milk and eggs. But not life. When the cow was calfing
someone slept in the barn, and on very cold nights kerosenA
heaters warmed the hen house. The animals had names —
Bossie the cow, Bessie and Bert the chickens. Names like
that. Not very imaginative, perhaps, but these names helped
consolidate the bonds between the animals and their human
caretakers. These farmers ate chicken, but never Bessie or
Bert.

My guess is, many people of my generation had a farm
like this in their childhood. Back then families took drives
in the country on Sundays; farms were places people visited
in those days. And for those who lacked this opportunity
there were the stories: Henny Penny, Brer Rabbit, Black
Beauty, and the breathtaking adventures of African explor—
ers in Our Weekly Reader and of Tarzan on Saturday morn-
ings at the movies. Through these windows we glimpsed a
world apart from the piercing whistles of the steam engines
in the night, heard alien sounds unlike the grating of huge
steel wheels rolling across tracks worn sleek as silver. Urban

 




—

year I was making a little money playing
in big dance bands and in small combos.
I played any reed instrument but mainly
clarinet and tenor sax. I doubt if I ever
would have become a really good musi—
cian had I continued playing. I enjoyed
the camaraderie as much as the music.
In the civilian world the closeness of
musicians may be the nearest thing to
those legendary wartime friendships
formed in foxholes.

After graduating from North Alle-
gheny High School I went to college.
This I did for a simple reason: it was
what all my friends were doing. I then
had only the faintest idea about what a
college was. All I knew ﬁrsthand was
that people “like me” went to one
because—well, because that’s what col—
leges were for. I was encouraged in this
belief by the testimony of my teachers
and other interested persons. I had a
good but hardly outstanding academic
record in high school (top tenth of my
class, as I recall). Every Open House all
my teachers told my parents the same
thing: “Tommy could do much better if
only he would apply himself.” “Who
couldn’t?” I wondered at the time. And
still do.

One person in particular, Reverend
Luther Fackler, who was the minister of
the Lutheran Church I attended, encour-
aged me to give college a try. I thought I
felt a “calling” for the ministry. But I
was unsettled in my faith. Even before I
went off to college I was unable to join
in the recitation of the Apostles’ Creed.
The words stuck in my throat. Reverend
Fackler told me not to worry. God would
ﬁnd me—but only if I stopped trying to
ﬁnd God. This seems as unsound to me
now as it did to me then. Any God who
would ﬁnd me only on the condition that
I was looking the other way is a God not
worth ﬁnding. That much hubris any
human worthy of being created by God
ought to have.

I wrote an essay on this issue at the
time, called “The Seeker.” Neither per-
turbed nor distracted, Reverend Fackler
counseled me not to worry. A true faith

is measured by the depth of its tempta—
tions to deny, he said. As I was sorely
tempted in the latter regard, off I went to
college, to ﬁnd (or, perhaps, to be found

by) the Divine Mind. I chose Reverend
Fackler’s college—Thiel College, a
small liberal arts college afﬁliated with
the Lutheran Church, an hour and a half
drive north of Pittsburgh. I applied to no
other. My friends’ parents were most
supportive. My mother and father for a
variety of reasons were less sure. I was
too. Folks from the North Side could
smell trouble a mile away.

ON THE BANKS OF THE SHENANGO:
'I'HIEI. COLLEGE

At the beginning, college was every-
thing my last years in high school had
not been. I had a hard time making
friends during my freshman year,
despite playing (at 138 pounds) halfback
on the football team. To say I “played”
halfback in college may be—well, actu—
ally it is an exaggeration. I did letter in
football (and in track and golf) in high
school. College was a different league. I
was in over my head and should have
had enough sense to quit. It was not until
my sophomore year that the Age of
Wisdom dawned. I never played varsity
football again. But even to this day I har—
bor the belief, as deep and unfalsiﬁable
as any I have ever held, that I have good
hands. You throw a ball near me and
damned if I won’t catch it!

Whatever Red Barber might write
about my sporting life, my early acade—
mic career at Thiel was unspectacular.
Something like a 2.5 average on a 4.0
system. Before going off to college, as I
mentioned earlier, my teachers encour—
aged me in the belief that I might some—
day be a writer. My teachers during my
ﬁrst two years at Thiel seemed to be

ted her handyman to graze a few cows
on her pasture. Once, after a calf had
been taken from his mother (I did not
know what had happened at the time), I
approached her because of the moumful
cries of the mother. All through one
night and into the next day the poor
animal moaned and groaned. Surely, I
said, the animal must be dying or at least
be very sick. Shouldn’t we do something
to help?

lady permitted my city ignorance to pass

without making much over it. Mothers
worry about their children, she
explained. The cow was calling for her
lost child. It was that simple. There was
no need to do anything. She could forget
her loss in time. As usual this sturdy
twig of a woman was right. The follow—
ing day the mother grazed contentedly.
The next time I heard these same cries I
understood what they meant, only this
time I thought them rather a nuisance. I
remember shouting out the window at
the grieving mother, telling her to shut
up. I had important work to do and she
was bothering me.

Like so many newly married couples
who acquire a companion animal, we
treated Gleco as our substitute child. We
took him everywhere we could, fretted
over his every sign of unhappiness, felt
guilt-ridden because we had to leave
him alone during most days. For his part
Gleco became a loyal but in some ways
an always independent companion.
There was something of the cat in him—
a trace of aloofness beneath the surface
sheen of his ordinary congeniality. He

never cared overly much about pleasing
us, though he loved us just the same. His
subsequent death helped change my life
forever.

THE WAR: FIDDLING WITH MY
PROFESSION

My education at Virginia was more
or less typical of the time. “Analytic
philosophy” was the dominant approach
to the discipline in places like UVA that
had a strong British presence. The ruling
preoccupation in moral philosophy,
which is where my interests naturally
led me, concerned questions about the
proper analysis of concepts.

My spirit bent to what my teachers
required. I wrote my Master’s Thesis on
the concept of beauty and my Ph.D.
Dissertation on the concept of goodness.
As a true professional my concerns were
strictly analytic; I inquired into the
meaning of the words “good” and
“beauty.” Not a single judgment about
the goodness or beauty of anything fell
from my pen. At this time and in that
place it was not the business of a
philosopher to take a moral or aesthetic
stand on anything. To do so was beneath
the intellectual dignity of the profession.
I practiced what I heard preached.

After my graduation, when I
embarked on my teaching career, my
classes in moral philosophy initially
mimicked those I had had as a graduate
student. But I was never wholly satisﬁed
with this way of doing moral philoso-
phy. What had originally attracted me to
the subject were my deep worries over
what things are just and unjust, right and
wrong, good and bad. Perhaps I would
have managed to leave these interests
permanently behind me had it not been
for a development over which neither I
nor any other ordinary person had much
control. Before any of us quite realized
it, America was at war in Vietnam. And
that fact changed a great deal, including
the direction of my intellectual develop-
ment.

The dilemma I faced at the time was
quite simple. Every evening on the news
I sat and watched people being killed.

dangling participles? Believe me, I thought long and hard
about quitting more than once.

I even managed to flunk Spanish. Elementary Spanish at

TO AVOID HISTORY: A PHILOSOPHER IS BORN
A crisis occurred during my junior year at Thiel. I was an
English major at the time and to complete the required
course of studies I was obliged to take a full year of English
history as well as a year of United States and Pennsylvania
history. This was like asking me to spend two years lounging
on a bed of hot coals. Whatever talents and interests I may
ave ha the study of history did not nourish or answer
them. Fortunately for me the forces of serendipity took
charge of my life —— not for the first or the last time.

Thiel was just about to introduce a new major in
philosophy. I had taken a few philosophy courses by then
and was pleased to discover that a subject actually existed
where people discussed the questions I increasingly was
inclined to ask on my own. In addition, my professors in
philosophy showed an interest in me that was lacking in
most of their counterparts in English. I would like to be
able to say that I decided to major in philosophy because
of my commitment to pursue Truth, whatever the cost. But
the really decisive factor in my decision to change was far
more banal. This new major in philosophy did not require
any classes in history over and above those I had already
taken. That much settled, the decision was easy. I was to
be Thiel College’s first-ever philosophy major. It was a

And so it was that during the sum-
mer of 1960 I applied for admission to
the Graduate School of Arts and
Sciences at the University of Virginia, to
continue my study of philosophy. Two
months before the ﬁrst class—

 

 

 

corpses of animals, but I was stone deaf
to their cries. I didn’t like my appren-
ticeship because the work was too
bloody hard, not because it was too
bloody. My days in the butcher’s trade
were numbered. But not for anything
like the right reasons.

As my graduation from Thiel
approached I interviewed for a variety of
jobs: selling insurance for Sears; serving
as a Youth Counselor for a suburban
branch of the YMCA; pursuing a career
in marketing for H]. Heinz. These inter—
views were glorious ﬁascoes. It did not
take me long to learn that I was a round
peg trying to ﬁt into square holes. I
knew quite well what I did not want to
do. The problem was to ﬁnd the round
hole that answered my needs and
interests.

If the idea of college was mysterious
to me while I was in high school, the
idea of graduate school was even more
incomprehensible to me while I was in
college. “What was a graduate school?”
I wondered. “And what did a person do
there?” I had only the foggiest idea. As
my job prospects dwindled (I was elim-
inated from consideration for the
YMCA job because I didn’t have the
“right” ideas about where blacks
belonged in the particular branch: They
belonged outside I was told), I had to do
something.

at least this is my recollec-
tion—I received a letter
informing me that I had been
accepted “conditionally.” This
meant I was admitted but that
my status would be reevaluated
on the basis of my work during
the ﬁrst semester. There was,
after all, enough evidence of
mediocrity on my college tran—
script to rattle anyone’s con-
fidence. Thank heavens my
major professor at Thiel was a
graduate of Virginia. Had it not been for
the inﬂuence and guidance of Bob
Bryan at this time I may well have ended
up selling collision insurance for
Allstate. And this is not the least of my
many debts to him.

 

STILL UNSETTLED: THE UNIVERSITY
YEARS

My graduate career at Virginia began
inauspiciously enough. I was blue collar
in my background. The students I met
all seemed to be Blue Blood in theirs.
Virginia had no female students at the
time and we Gentlemen (as we then
were called) wore coats and ties to class.
I had one suit and two ties. I was the kid
without socks who spilled soup on his
pants to the delight of the country club
set. Or so it seemed.

I remember well a young man in my
Plato seminar, a graduate of St. John’s
College in Annapolis, where the educa—
tion consists of reading and discussing
the Great Books, many of which I had
never heard of, let alone read. We were
walking together after a seminar in
which we discussed Plato’s Theatetus. I
couldn’t make much sense of the dia—
logue and was rash enough to say so.
Others seemed not to ﬁnd the material
difﬁcult. Stopping abruptly, my com-
patriot looked me squarely in the eye.

The interests of those
who profit from animal
exploitation should play
no role whatsoever in
deciding whether to abol—
ish the institution that
furthers those interests.

The rights of animals
should never be violated
so that some people can
have a good time or
because others make a
comfortable living from
doing so.

The Animal Rights
Movement

The struggle for animal
rights is not for the faint
of heart. The pace of
social change requires
the endurance of the
marathoner, not the
lightning speed of the
sprinter.

My belief in the ultimate
triumph of justice for
animals is no less today
than it was [twenty
years ago, when I wrote
The Case for Animal
Rights]; ifanything, it is
stronger. Let’s just say
my idealism has been
tempered by a strong
dose of realism.

The struggle for animal
rights...calls for a deeper,
more fundamental
change in the way we
think about membership
in the moral community.
It demands not an
expansion but a disman-
tling of the for-humans-
only conception...

essential mark of an educated Gentle—i

cessfully) and speaking with an affected
British accent, he said, “Regan, you
strike me as a man to whom it will not
be difﬁcult to say goodbye come the end
of your ﬁrst and, dare I say, your only
semester.” Then he placed his pipe back
in his mouth and walked away, leaving
me transﬁxed on the spot where I stood.

I was shattered. Here I was, a kid off
Pittsburgh’s streets, trying to make an
honest go of it at Mr. Jefferson’s Univer—
sity. And here was this J. Press son-of-
privilege putting me in my place, telling
me that I didn’t belong. And who was I
to deny that he was right? Didn’t I think
his very thoughts myself?

Socially and intellectually, this was
the lowest point of my life. It took me
months to begin to regain any sem-
blance of self-conﬁdence. But in time I
did, and though I am not a particularly
vengeful or spiteful person I must con-
fess that I took more than a little plea—
sure when, at the end of my ﬁrst semes-
ter, I was invited to continue my studies
in philosophy while my solemn col-
league from St. John’s was not. I
thought of it then, and I think of it now,
as a small but real victory for the work-
ing class.

My record at Virginia was better than
my record at Thiel. A few Bs during that
ﬁrst year; the rest As. I have the deepest
affection for the teachers who taught me
during the years I was there, and I have
nothing but the most profound respect
for the ideals The University embodies.
I count myself very lucky indeed for
having had the opportunity to pass
through its corridors.

But lest it seem that I slight my debts
to Thiel I must cite a sentiment one will
ﬁnd inscribed on that College’s sundial.
Roughly translated from the Latin it
reads: “Perhaps in the future these
things will appear beautiful.” The sun-
dial’s message rings. true. Time does
soften the harsh edges of past places and
events. And that is not the only truth
Thiel College gave me.

MORAL INDIFFERENCE: ANIMALS COME
AND GO

In the Spartan, no-nonsense regimen
of Thiel, and the more reﬁned ambiance
of Virginia, animals were all but absent.

 

The University had some legendary
dogs—legendary largely for their pro-
claimed accomplishments as drinkers.
(Back then students at UVA took pride
in their well-deserved reputation as the
biggest drinkers around.) Perhaps the
story is apocryphal but one dog (Jock
was his name, I think) was reputed
always to have lifted his leg on the oppo-
nent’s goal post at half time during foot-
ball games. And (so the story went)
some two thousand people attended
Jock’s funeral, the dog having been
killed (suitably enough, it was thought)
while chasing a beer truck through the
streets of Charlottesville.

All this was part of the oral tradition
of The University at this time. No one I
knew thought for a moment that there
was anything morally dubious about
getting a dog drunk or ﬁnding it really
funny that old Jock would get himself
killed by a truck ﬁlled with Budweiser.
That I also found the story amusing is
symptomatic of those deeper, unarticu-

fronted California Avenue, a busy thoroughfare on the city’s
North Side: four lanes of traffic, two trolley lines. It could
get hectic. We never played ball on California Avenue.
Beyond the traffic there was a sharp drop to a leveled space
some fifteen feet below the street. A dozen train tracks
sliced their way . . You could not see the trains,
either from the street or from the second story windows of
our house. But their relentless presence was the most
dominant aspect of daily life. This was before diesel engines.
Everything was steam. That means coal-powered. The air
was filled with great plumes of grayish white smoke and
phosphorescent Cinders that glowed in the night air. Pas-
senger and freight trains hurried by, their whistles wailing
throughout the day and all the night. Everywhere there
was the crashing sound of cars being coupled and uncoupled
on the Hump. Great lines of cars, hundreds at a time —
freight and oil, flatbeds and cattle — were strung together
by the skilled workmen. Twenty-four hours a day, seven
days a week, every day of every month you heard the sound
of heavy metal.

Everyone who lived along this sprawling artery that linked
the coal mines of West Virginia to the steel mills of
Pittsburgh belonged to the railroad. This was true even
when, as in my family’s case, no one worked for it. The soot
and smoke invaded your eyes and ears, your nose and
mouth, the elastic around your underwear and the clothes
in your dresser. When you took a bath, a broad, dark black
ring remained in the tub after you drained it, a reminder,
lest one forget — how could one? — of the clanging world
outside. My neighborhood was a child’s paradise, a place
where a kid could luxuriate in the steamy dirt of industrial
urban living.

That neighborhood is all but gone now. The house where
I was raised has been demolished. In fact the entire block
of houses now is an open field, full of weeds and an-eeeas-i-onal-
wildflowe Even the railroad is all but idle. Most of the
houses that remain have been boarded up, condemned by

kids of my generation-and place were bred and raised on
the machine, but we took sustenance in our real and imagi-
nary commerce with the garden.

Some children understand early on what meat is. They
realize that a roast or a pork chop or a chicken leg is a piece
of dead animal. A corpse. I was not that precocious. Like
most Americans I grew up unmindful of the connection
between the food on my plate and the death of the creature
it represents. The animals I knew personally, Tippy for one,
and other dogs and cats in the neighborhood, I considered
my friends. Even Bossie and Bert were objects of my affec-
tion. But I lacked the imagination then to see the connection
between my fondness for these animals and the silent pieces
of flesh that came from my mother’s skillet or roaster. The
human mind is remarkable for its ability to see the world
in bits and pieces, each part disconnected from the resylike
an expansive vista Viewed through the narrow slits of a
picket fence. It was not until much later in my life that the
chronic idleness of my imagination was overwhelmed by
the force of logic and the vicissitudes of experience.

TRANSITION: THE BURBS

Had my family remained on the North Side it is virtually
certain that I never would have gone to college. People in
that neighborhood grew up to work, not to study. My parents
were products of that pattern. Neither finished the ninth
grade. There was work to be done. Mouths to be fed. Edu-
cation was a luxury. My parents were unable to pay the
price.

My sister was different: She graduated from high school.
But then the pattern took hold again. She went directly
from the classroom to the workforce. A much better student
than I was and natively much smarter, she was certain to
have had a distinguished university career had she had the
opportunity. , ' ' '

' . And
I? I was destined to follow my sister’s lead. The duty of

 

work called. It was not a matter of whether but where to
get down to the task of making a living.

But then a momentous thing happened: We moved. To
the suburbs. My parents decided that they had had it. That
grime-filled heaven of my boyhood had been their hell for
too long. We were getting out! No ifs, and’s, or but’s. And
I? I was fifteen, with deep roots in the friendships and
places of my youth. If ever a child was resentful and full of
anger, Mrs-WWW these
powerful emotions found a home in me. I was determined
to be unhappy.

The world did not cooperate with my resolve. In the end
the move was not as traumatic as I was bent on making it.
I made new friends and soon found myself a part of a quite
different environment. Many of my friends’ parents had
gone to college. They had professions — in medicine, the
law, education. Their taste for culture trickled down to their
children and, through them, to me. I soon found myself
reading and talking about Camus and Andre Gide, discus-
sing Nietzsche and Norman Mailer, listening to Bartok and
Stravinsky. With my companions I drove into and around
the Burgh to watch foreign and classic films. We debated
God’s existence and free will into the morning hours. For
the first time in my life I began to write. Horrible fiction.
Worse poetry. But I took the demands of the Muse seriously.
And my teachers liked it. They told me I was a writer-in-the-
making. They did not know the demands of the mines and
the mills. Their life had found a place for the mind. And

so had mine. But only an inch at a time. IN SE32] 4.

I was making a little money playing in big dance bands and
in small combos. Glenn Miller. Ted Heath. Les Elgart.
Harry James. Ellington. We played all the big bands’ tunes
and arrangements. And as for the combos: The AJQ. The
MJQ. Brubeck and Desmond. Gerry Mulligan. The (early)
Miles Davis. We borrowed and played what we could. At
small dances and parties. At wedding receptions. (Oh, the
wedding receptions!) I was the lead Reed Man. I played
any reed instrument in sight, but mostly clarinet and tenor
sax. I doubt if I ever wo d pave become a really good
musician had I continued r. But I did enjoy both
the music and the camaraderie. In the civilian world the
closeness of musicians may be the nearest thing to those
legendary wartime friendships formed in foxholes.

After graduating from North Allegheny High School I
went to college. This I did for a simple reason: It was what
all my friends were doing. I then had only the faintest idea
about what a college was. All I knew firsthand was that
people “like me” went to one because — well, because that’s
what colleges were for. I was encouraged in this belief by
the testimony of my teachers and other interested persons.
I had a good but hardly outstanding academic record in
high school (top tenth of my class, as I recall). Every Open
House all my teachers told my parents the same thing:
“Tommy could do much better if only he would apply him-
self. ” “W 0 con n’t?” I wo ered at the time. And still do.
But two pgdﬁle ifl‘p‘cfrﬁlscu ar — the-late Reverend Luther
Fackler, who was the minister of the Lutheran Church I
attended, and Ralph Pannier, who in addition to being a
near neighbor also taught my Sunday School class — these
two men in particular encouraged me to give college a try.
Perhaps in part it is because of their mutual involvement
with the Church that I have never taken the power of religion
lightly. Its power for the good, I mean.

 

 

 




this way. Such joy they and their parents bring to our lives; so many
blessings; too many to count.

Talk of footprints might create the impression that I think my
work is done. Over. Finished. Nothing could be further from the
truth. Today, on the eve of my 66th birthday, I am just as committed,
if not more so, to liberating animals from the clutches of human
tyranny than I was more than 30 years ago, when I first began to
think about the issues. It was Aristotle who observed (and I quote)
”there are no boy philosophers.” By this he meant that we have to
experience the world and smooth-off the rough corners of our
personal identity before we can do our best work. My principal
inﬂuence, the philosopher Immanuel Kant, is a case in point; he did
not do his most creative thinking until he was in his sixties. I like to
think the same is true in my case: the better, the more creative, the
more productive days are ahead.

So (in response to Nozick’s question, asked some 20 years ago):
”Now what will I do?”

My answer is, and it will remain: ”All of the above.”

the tangible result of the line of reason-
ing I began to investigate in the summer
of 1972 and which I completed in the
fall of 1973.

THE DEATH OF A FRIEND:
THE IMAGINATION AWAKENS

Another event helped change my life
irrevocably, and this one had nothing to
do with philosophy. This was an affair of .
the heart, not the head. And it also took
place in that momentous summer of

 

1972. Nancy and I, and our two chil-
dren, Karen and Bryan, who then were
one and ﬁve respectively, had taken a
vacation. Earlier on the day we returned
home, Gleco was killed—hit by a car
while darting across a road.

Faced with this incalculable loss,
Nancy and I lapsed into a period of
intense, shared grief. For days we cried
at the mere mention or memory of
Gleco. Earlier that summer, while think-
ing about Gandhi and paciﬁsm, I had
encountered the rude question of the
ethics of meat eating. Once severed
from any essential connection with paci-
ﬁsm, the rational arguments seemed to
be there. My head had begun to grasp a
moral truth that required a change in
behavior. Reason demanded that I
become a vegetarian. But it was the
sense of irrevocable loss that added the
power of feeling to the requirements of
logic.

What Gleco’s death forced upon me
was the realization that my emotional
attachment to a particular dog was a
contingent feature of the world. Of my
world. Except for a set of circumstances
over which I had no control, I would
have loved some other dog (Jock, per—
haps, or the poor creature at the mercy
of the med student). And given some
other conditions, over which again I had
no control, I would never have even
known Gleco at all. I understood, in a
ﬂash it seemed, that my powerful feel-
ings for this particular dog, for Gleco,
had to include other dogs. Indeed, every
other dog. Any stopping point short of
every dog was, and had to be, rationally
and emotionally arbitrary.

And not just dogs. Wherever in the
world there is life that feels, a being
whose welfare can be affected by what
we do (or fail to do), there love and com—
passion, justice and protection must ﬁnd
a home. From this point forward, my
heart and head were one. Philosophical
argument can lead the heart to water, but
perhaps it is only experience that can
make it drink. Nancy understood this, as
well if not better than I did. Throughout
our journey, she was beside or ahead of
me every step of the way. We awoke one
day to the realization that we had
become vegetarians. The intellectual
challenge before me was to make our
sense of the world less vague and the
grounds for accepting it rationally more
compelling. That in general was the task
I set myself and at which I have worked
more or less continuously during the rest
of my life.

With rare exceptions, Animal Rights Advocates are for love of family and country, for human rights
and justice, for human freedom and equality, for compassion and mercy, for peace and tolerance, for
special concern for those with special needs (children, the enfeebled, the elderly, among others), for
a clean, sustainable environment, for the rights of our children’s children’s children—our future
generations. In a word, the vast majority are Norman Rockwell Americans, straight off his famous
Thanksgiving cover for the old Saturday Evening Post, only with this noteworthy difference. We’ll
pass on the turkey, thank you. We don’t eat our friends. (Empty Cages, p. 19)

ON (All: ROPING

In rodeos, calves can reach speeds up to thirty miles an hour before they are lassoed (‘clotheslined’);
often they are jerked over backward and slammed. to the ground The faster they are running at the
time, the harder theyare pulled backward. And the harder they are pulled backward, the more their
necks are wrenched and the greater the force with which they hit the ground. Some calves do not do
' encores. It’s one performance and out So
here we have today’s brave cowboy, bending
over and tying up a frightened, dazed, disori-
ented baby (the animals are all of four or five
months old), with neck and back injuries,
bruises, broken bones, and internal hemor—
rhages. Are those who are working to abolish
rodeo in general, calf roping in particular, just
overwrought, emotionally unbalanced calf
huggers? (Empty Cages, p. 152)

 

ON DOLPHINS TRAINED TO PERFORM IN
MARINE PARKS

Free dolphins swim up to forty miles a day and can dive to depths of more than a quarter mile. In
their natural environment, they live in extended social groups (pods) and ﬁnd their way around in an
ever-changing, challenging environment via echolocation. (They ‘see’ by hearing). Once in captivi—
ty, these animals are confined in concrete tanks (sometimes measuring as little as twenty-four feet
long by twenty-four feet wide by six feet deep) or in small sea-cages. There are no pods here. Nothing
changes in any signiﬁcant way in this desolate world. No natural challenges are faced. Nothing
naturally interesting is found because there is nothing naturally interesting to be found. To speak can-
didly, it is worse than disingenuous; it is shameful that anyone would stand before us and say, ‘We
really and truly care about the welfare of our dolphins,’ animals who have nothing to locate, no family
to be with, no place to dive, no miles to swim. (Empty Cages. P. 137)

ON SPORT HUNTING

When all the rhetorical dust settles, the real rush for the sport hunter comes from the kill. Any doubt
about this, just look through any of the hunting magazines at the local newsstand. The hunters
pictured in those pages, displaying their dead wares, smiling from ear to ear, could not be happier. If
we asked them to pose with beanbag chairs, it just wouldn’t be the same. (Empty Cages, p. 149)

can do with one 5 life after the questions of a lane-per mate

and companion have been answered once and for all.
Early on in our marriage we purchased a miniature poo-

dle. We called him “Gleco,” after the name of a company

we drove past every day en route to and from Charlottesville.

Nancy was an instructor in Special Educationm-re— f

M in the public schools. I was taking my
graduate seminars. We lived in two rooms on the second
floor of an older farm house about thirteen miles from The
University. The landlady was a strong-willed but friendly
Southern woman who lived alone, having raised all her
children after her husband, without any warning and so to
everyone’s surprise, committed suicide one Saturday morn-
ing. With a shotgun. She allowed her handyman to graze a
few head of cattle on her pasture. Once, after a calf had
been taken from his mother (I did not know what had hap—
pened at the time), I approached her because of the mourn-
ful cries of the mother. All through one night and into the
next day the poor animal moaned and groaned. Surely, I
told our landlady, the animal must be dying or at least be
very sick. Shouldn’t we do something to help her? Shouldn’t
we at least call the vet? Always the gentlewoman, our land-
lady permitted my city ignorance to pass without making
much over it. Mothers worry over their children, she
explained. The cow was calling out for her lost child. It was
that simple. There was no need to do anything. She would
forget her loss in time. As usual this sturdy twig of a woman
was right. The following day the mother grazed contentedly.
The next time I heard these same cries I understood what
they meant, only this time I thought them rather a nuisance.
I remember shouting out the window at the grieving mother,
telling her to shut up. I had important work to do and she
was bothering me. Cmpantcm qn,M¢(

during most days. For his part Gleco became a loyal but in
some ways an always independent companion. There was
something of the cat in him — a trace of aloofness beneath
the surface sheen of his ordinary congeniality. Certainly he
refused to be taught to heel and the rest of it, and his
frequent displays of unbridled destructiveness when we left
him alone made every return home suspenseful. “What
could Gleco have done today?” Nancy and I wondered as
we climbed the stairs and opened the door to our rooms.
What he did on some days was to rip the bed apart, devour
the sofa cover, tear the bottom out of the overstuffed

chair, and litter the logs from the fireplace to kingdomﬁﬂ‘rl”

THE WAR: FIDDLING WITH MY PROFESSION

My education at Virginia was more or less typical of the
time. “Analytic philosophy” was the dominant approach to
the discipline in places with a heavy British inﬂuence, and
Virginia’s philosophy department certainly had a heavy
British inﬂuence during my student year. “Animal rights”
was not so much as mentioned. Probably it would have
been swept out of the room if it had been. But neither were
abortion, or euthanasia, or world hunger. The ruling pre-
occupation in moral philosophy, which is where my interests
naturally led me, concerned questions about the proper
analysis of concepts. My spirit bent to conform itself to what
my teachers required. I wrote my Master’s Thesis on the
concept of beauty and my Ph. D. Dissertation on the concept
of goodness. As a true professional my concerns were strictly
analytic; I inquired into the meaning of the words “good”
and “beauty.” Not a single judgment about twoodness or
beauty of anything fell from my pen. At that- 1'rsne and in
that place it was not the business of a philosopher to take
a moral or aesthetic stand on anything. To do so was beneath
the intellectual dignity of the profession. I practiced what
I heard preached.

After my graduation, when I embarked on my teaching
career, my classes in moral philosophy initially mimicked
those I had had as a graduate student. But I was never
Wholly satisfied with this way of doing moral philosophy.
What had originally attracted me to the subject were my
deep worries over what things are just and unjust, right
and wrong, good and bad. And yet here I was teaching
moral philosophy, and doing research in the field, in ways
that required that I set these important questions aside.
Perhaps I would have managed to leave them permanently
behind me had it not been for a development over which
neither I nor any other ordinary person had much contr 1.
Before any of us quite realized it America was at war will;
Vietnam. And that fact changed a great deal, including the
direction of my own intellectual development.

The dilemma I faced at the time was quite simple. Every
evening on the news I sat and watched people being killed.
Americans and Vietnamese. Young men the age of most of
my students. Women and children. And here I was, an
educated moral philosopher, worrying about the meaning
of the word “right” and whether there is such a thing as the
naturalistic fallacy. I could see myself fiddling with my pro-
fession while Vietnam burned. Something had to give. And
since it was beyond my power to stop the war (though I
worked politically to help end it), I decided to approach
things from the philosophical side. I began to think about

review was accepted and, in April 1973,
published.

Reader response was overwhelming.
The Australian—bom, Oxford—educated
philosopher opened the eyes of many
readers to some of the terrible things
being done to animals. The editors of
New York Review of Books understood
that this was something special, so spe-
cial that they took the unprecedented
step of offering to publish a book on the
topics covered by the reviewer if he was
interested in writing one. He was. A
contract was tendered and the book writ-
ten. The philosopher’s name: Peter Sing-
er. The title of his book: Animal Liber-
ation. The rest, as they say, is history.

As it happened, I had an opportunity
to teach at Oxford during the summer of
1973. I had read Singer’s review and
wrote to him, explaining that we shared
many of the same interests. While I was
in Oxford, we met several times. We
agreed that an anthology of mainly
philosophical writings on our duties to
animals would be both timely and use—
ful. By the fall of 1975, we had a manu—
script. We even had a title: Animal
Rights and Human Obligations. Our
next challenge was to ﬁnd a publisher.

So off I went to the annual meeting
of the Eastern Division of the American
Philosophical Association. One of the
major textbook publishers had a recep—
tion to which I was invited. After intro—
ducing myself to the philosophy editor, I
handed him a copy of the prospectus
Singer and I had put together. The edi-
tor’s response was one of startled
incredulity. He looked at me as if I was
in immediate need of the most profound
psychiatric help.

“You want to publish a book on...” he
began. Unable to complete the sentence,
he tried again. “You want to publish a
book...on...” This time he found it impos—
sible to stiﬂe his laughter. Guffaw.
Guffaw. “I’m sorry,”-he said, “but this is
too much. I mean, ‘animal rights’ !”
More guffawing. If there had been a hole
in the ﬂoor, I would have crawled into it,
I was so embarrassed. And angry, too.

But here’s the rest of the story. The
editor took the prospectus home, looked
it over, and sent it out for review. A few
months later, Singer and I had a contract
in hand. Over the years, that little book
has sold tens of thousands of copies and
has been read by tens of thousands of
students. As for the philosophy editor:
after making a name for himself as
someone who was ahead of the times, he
went on to have a distinguished career in
the world of book publishing.

Animal Rights and Human Obliga-
tions was just one among many books
that found a niche in the college market
from the 1970s onward. It is no exag—
geration to say that, during the past
thirty years, philosophers have written
vastly more on the topic of ethics and
animals than our predecessors had
written in the previous three thousand.

This has made a profound difference

_
Any time some people (the (Inf)
want to exploit other ‘inferior’ people
( the (Oats’), the Ins will always have
two powerfal forces on their siele: One
will he organized religion; the other,
the ‘hest’ science of the play. Both will
say ( in their authoritative voices):
The Ins really are hetter than the
Oats. Oar sacrerl hooles say so. So olo
oar esteernerl scientists. So, what’s to
complain? The Oats are exactly

where they helong. Uncler the hoot
of the Ins.

 

in the classroom. Whereas there was not
a single philosophy course in which the
idea of animal rights was discussed
when I began writing “The Moral Basis
of Vegetarianism,” today there are per—
haps as many as a hundred thousand
students a year discussing this idea. Just
in philosophy. Comparable changes are
underway in other disciplines, including
anthropology, art history, ﬁlm studies,
law, literature, religion, and sociology.
Clearly, in the world of ideas, in univer—

To act in ways that are

that are respectful of the

they are.

A prudent morality
enjoins us to act on
what is true, not on
what might be.

Prejudices die hard.

”The true obiective for which animal advocates

should work is empty cages, not larger cages.”

Critics

In lieu of fair criticism
of my philosophical case
for animal rights, some
people in high places—
including some lofty
towers of academe—have
attacked me rather than
addressing my ideas. For
example, they have slan-
dered my character by
accusing me of inciting
others to riot and by
implicating me in a
variety of crimes,
including murder.

The way one philosopher
shows respect for anoth-
er philosopher is by chal—
lenging the other ’5 ideas,
by trying to show (fair-
ly, of course) that these
ideas are false, or unsup-
ported, or worse. To do
anything else would be
...well, philosophical bad
manners.

Change

Ethical progress is never
easy. We would be better
at it, ifit were.

None of us is so accul-
turated that we sleep-
walk through our moral
lives.

You don’t change unjust
institutions by tidying
them up.

The verdicts of history
teach that entrenched
social practices not only
can change, they have
changed. But never
without a struggle.

People should not be
deterred from moving
forward on their journey
because someone else
doesn’t understand
where they are on theirs.

A human being is not a
robot, not a genetically
hard-wired stimulus-
response machine, not a
body lacking a mind and
will.

Everything we know
about human growth—
about the ﬂourishing of
the human spirit and the
actualization of those
capacities that make a
human life truly worth
living—points to the
need for each of us to take
charge of our life, to nur-
ture our rational autono-
my, and to cultivate our
capacity to care, not only
for ourselves and others
but for what is true and
just and good.

So long as we rest con-
tent with what we have
been taught about right
and wrong, we give sad
testimony to the fact

that our life really does
not matter much to us.

Rights

Rights involve justice,
not generosity; what one
is due, not what one
wants.

The money someone
makes by violating
another ’5 rights is never
moral reason enough for
doing so.

To attempt to determine
which humans have
rights on the basis of
race is like trying to
sweeten tea by adding
salt. What race we are
tells us nothing about
what rights we have.

What happens to us
after we die does not
help us understand why
we have the rights we do
while we are alive.

Asking who has an
immortal soul is as logi-
cally irrelevant to asking
who has rights as asking
who has blond hair or
missing teeth.

Morally considered, a
genius who can play
Chopin etudes with one
hand tied behind her
back does not have a
’higher’ rank than a

confess that I took more than a little pleasure when, at the
end of my first semester, I was invited to continue my
studies in philosophy while my solemn colleague from St.
John’s was not. I thought of it then, and I think of it now,
as a small but real victory for the working class. i ‘

My record at Virginia was good but not great. Some B’s;
mostly As I have the deepest affection for the teachers who
taught me during the years I was there, and I have nothing
but the most profound respect for the ideals The University
embodies. I count myself very lucky indeed for having had
the opportunity to pass through its corridors. I am the sort
of person who is quietly loyal to institutions, not only people.
Though I do not belong to anything as formal or social as a
chapter of the Alumni Association I like to think of my
efforts as a teacher and philosopher as my quiet way of
trying to repay The University for its patient investment in
me. Doors could have been closed that were opened. I shall
never forget this. To this day one of my favorite quotes is
from Jefferson; it is inscribed on the facade of the building
where my seminars in philosophy were held. “Here we are
not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead,” it reads,
“or to tolerate the possibility of error, so long as reason is
left free to combat it.” That sentiment is The University in
my mind, and nothing better captures my own sense of
what the spirit of rational inquiry is or should be.

But lest it seem that I slight my debts to Thiel I must
cite another, quite different, but no less true and important
sentiment one will find inscribed on that College’s sun dial.
Roughly translated from the Latin it reads: “Perhaps in the
future these things will appear beautiful.” I cannot think of
this observation without experiencing an involuntary shud-
der, as when one thinks one sees a dead friend in a crowd.
The sun dial’s message is right: Time does soften the harsh
edges of past places and events. And that is not the only

truth Thiel College gave me. Gml 414,9,“
MORAL INNOCENCE: ANI ALS COME AND GO

In the Spartan, no-nonsense re imen of Thiel and the more
refined ambiance of Virginia, nimals were all but absent.
The University had some lejgendary dogs — legendary
largely for their proclaimed azcomplishments as drinkers.
(Back then students at UVA took pride in their well-deserved
reputation as the biggest drinkers around.) Perhaps the story
is apocryphal but one dog (Jock was his name, I think) was
reputed always to have lifted hlS leg on the opponent’s goal
post at half-time during football games. And (so the story
went) some two thousand peo le attended Jock’s funeral,
the dog having been killed (sui ably enough, it was thought)
while chasing a beer truck thr u l

ville lltisws a o -

sity o n ﬁ lilaepwﬁought for a moment that there was
anything morally dubious about getting a dog drunk or find-
ing it really funny that old Jock would get himself killed by
a truck filled with Budweiser. That I also found the story
amusing at this time is symptomatic of those deeper, unar-
ticulated beliefs I then had regarding animals, both about
what they are and about how they should be treated.

The same insensitivity I showed toward Jock’s fate I exhi-
bited in the face of a first year medical student’s emotional
anguish. At the beginning of my studies at Virginia I had a
room in a spotless older home only a few minutes walk from
the Grounds. In the room next to me lived a med student,
a tough looking, broad-chested Polish Jew from New Jersey,
very streetwise, very determined to get ahead with his

 

of"

 

career. Even so, he did not like what he was required to
do to a dog in his class in surgery. He described to me how
he broke the poor animal’s leg and then set it, only to break
and set it again. Throughout her long, painful ordeal the
loyal animal greeted his arrival with a wag of her tail and
even licked the very hands that had injured her. In the end,
after he had studied one or another thing about her treat-
ment and recovery, he was required to “euthanize” the dog.
It did not sit well with him. He thought it cruel and unneces—
sary. He wanted to speak out, to object, but he lacked the
courage. He wondered what sort of human being he was
or would become. He even questioned whether he should
make a career ne fine. In all this I believe he was as
sincere as an $33 can be. It hurt him to hurt another,
even a dog. '

For my part I was too much involved in understanding
Plato’s Theatetus and withstanding the insults of my peers
to find time to empathize much with this medical student,
let alone with the dog. I wish I could say that my ethical
sensitivities regarding animals always have been highly de-
veloped. The sad truth is, they have not. The story about
this dog bothered me no more and no less than the story
about Jock. Animals were not on my moral map.

Among the truly major blessings in my life was my mar-
riage to my wife Nancy on June 17, 1961. We remain indis-
solubly wedded, committed to our mutual growth. We are
of course radically different people now than we were when
we first met back in my sockless days at Thiel, and perhaps
it is as much a matter of luck as it is of our love for one
another that we have managed to develop in ways that have
brought us closer together rather than driving us farther
apart. Sometimes we even seem to look alike, impossible
though this is —— she of Lithuanian and Austrian blood, her
face showing the strong beauty of her Eastern European
ancestry; I of sturdy Irish stock, ruddy of complexion,
stump-nosed. How very fortunate we are to have settled
permanently into one another. There is so much more one

Paradoxically, however, when I look back on the process of
writing, Empty Cages today seems like another gift given to me, only
this time from some other source. I am so grateful that I was able to
bring it to fruition. Easy to read, if not to write, I harbor the hope that
it will reach a much larger audience than The Case and that, in
combination with the work of others, it will help revitalize the animal
rights movement, returning it to that magical time between the 1985
occupation of the NIH and the glorious day when tens of thousands
of ARAs marched down Pennsylvania Avenue.

FOOTPRINTS

Except for 2 years at the beginning of my professional life, my
home has been North Carolina State University. The University has
been good to me, in many ways. Although I was an outspoken
proponent of animal rights on a campus where students take degrees
in animal agriculture and where hundreds of faculty use animals in
their research, I was never punished or threatened for speaking my
mind or teaching what I taught.

Just the opposite. The University has honored my work,
presenting me with every award for teaching and research for which
I was eligible, culminating in receipt of the William Alexander
Quarles Medal, the highest honor the University can bestow on one
of its faculty.

As rewarding as these awards have been, I have the North
Carolina State University Library to thank for my greatest honor.
This is the Tom Regan Animal Rights Archive, inaugurated in 2001,
when, in response to the Library’s invitation, I donated my papers,
covering the whole of my personal and professional life. Since its
founding, the Archive has grown dramatically, thanks to major
additions from the Animal Rights Network, among others. Even
today the Archive is far and away the premiere repository of animal
rights materials in the world, something that occasions justifiable
pride in the Library’s administration and staff. On a personal note,
the Archive is a lifeline to the future. The Tom Regan Animal Rights
Archive will be at North Carolina State University as long as there is
a North Carolina State University. For generations to come, the
Archive, like a footprint, will attest to my having passed this way.

The same is true, in another way, now that our children have
married and have children of their own. There’s something of my
genes, and Nancy’s too, in Brooke, Hannah, Anna Drew, and our
grandchildren yet to be born. They, too, attest to our having passed

donating my papers, which I was more than happy to do. Since its
founding, the Tom Regan Animal Rights Archive has grown
dramatically, thanks to major additions from the Animal Welfare
Institute and the Animal Rights Network, among others. Even today
the Archive is far and away the premiere repository of animal rights
materials in the world; it will only get better as time passes.

The First Year Seminars. The Research Ethics Initiative. The
Tom Regan Animal Rights Archive. For me personally, these are
tangible lifelines to the future. For generations of students and
scholars to come, like footprints, they will attest to my having passed
this way. The pleasure I feel in knowing I am leaving something
behind is beyond my ability to express.

The same is true, in other ways, now that our children have
married and have children of their own. There’s something of my
genes, and N ancy’s too, in Brooke, Hannah, Anna Drew, and our
grandchildren yet to be born. They, too, attest to our having passed

this way. Such joy they and their parents bring to our lives; so many
blessings; too many to count.

MILES TO GO BEFORE I SLEEP

Talk of footprints might give the impression that I think my
work is finished. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is so
much to do, so much that needs doing. Here are some examples.

College students are a group too frequently ignored by the
animal rights movement. I think they are ready to be ”radicalized” in
ways that remind one of the student unrest of the sixties. Our
students today suffer from pent-up idealism. They want—and
need—to be part of something larger than themselves, something
good. And this good thing will be better in their View if their parents
did not champion it before them. The present generation of students
wants and needs a new cause—their cause.

I have no doubt that ARAs can help them choose the cause of
animal rights. A tangible way to measure our success is to keep track
of the number of animal rights groups we have on the thousands of
campuses here in the United States, and the thousands more
worldwide. Our goal should be to have a Student Animal Rights
Group on every campus. As I continue to present lectures at various

colleges and universities, I fully intend to do what I can to help make
this goal a reality.

Just the opposite. The University has honored my work,
presenting me with every award for teaching and research for which
I was eligible, culminating in receipt of the William Alexander
Quarles Medal, the highest honor the University can bestow on one
of its faculty.

During my final years of teaching, I made a special effort to try
to give something back to the University in return for all I had
received. Three projects stand out. First, I volunteered to chair a
Committee on the First Year, the main objective of which was to
create enriched educational opportunities for students entering my
college, the College of Humanities and Social Sciences. On the basis
of the committee’s recommendations, every first year student in
CHASS now has a special seminar in which vital ideas, including
race and class, gender and sexual orientation, are explored. These
First Year Seminars are a permanent part of the college’s educational
mission.

Second, I was asked to chair a special committee on Research
Ethics for the graduate school. After obtaining a grant from the
National Science Foundation, the committee crafted a plan that will
shape instruction in ethics, for every graduate student at the
university, throughout the 21St century.

Third, before retiring from the university, representatives of the
University Library approached me to ask whether I would consider

 




Americans and Vietnamese. Young men
the age of most of my students. Women
and children. And here I was, an educat-
ed moral philosopher, worrying about
the meaning of the word “right” and
whether there is such a thing as the
naturalistic fallacy. I could see myself
fiddling with my profession while
Vietnam burned.

Something had to give. And since it
was beyond my power to stop the war
(though Nancy and I worked politically
to help end it), I decided to approach
things from the philosophical side.
Ought we to be there? Was the war a just
war? Is violence ever justiﬁed? As
strange as it may sound, the immediate
ancestor of my views about animal
rights was my ﬁrst crude attempt to
come to terms morally with the war in
Vietnam.

If I had to be more precise and try to
ﬁx a particular time when the ride—of-
ideas began, I would say it was during
the summer of 1972. It was then that I
was the beneﬁciary of a Summer Grant
from the National Endowment for the
Humanities. My plan was to think about
paciﬁsm—the View that it is always
wrong, no matter what the circum—
stances, to use violence,
whether in self-defense
or aggressively. The con-
clusion I reached then,
and the one I still hold, is
that occasions can arise
in which the use of vio-
lence is justiﬁed. I was
not then, and am not now,
a paciﬁst.

Now, no one who sets
out to think about vio-
lence and paciﬁsm can do
the work that needs to be
done and not read Gan-
dhi. And read him I did:
hundreds and hundreds,
even thousands of pages
of his simple prose. This in itself was
remarkable. I have never been an ener-
getic reader. I envy people (Nancy is one
of them) who are. Especially during the
next twenty years or so, when I wrote

more and more, I read less and less.
Except, as I say, in the case of Gandhi. I
read him with enormous energy and
dedication.

It was during this particular period,
during the summer of 1972, that Gandhi
began to raise my consciousness about
the place of animals in the moral scheme
of things. His views on vegetarianism
were both simple and of a piece with his
more general views about right conduct.
The practice of ahimsa (frequently
translated “nonviolence”) does not stop
at the borders of our species. Morally we
are called upon to minimize our casual
role in the use of violence in the world at
large, even when animals are victims.

Once I had digested it I could no
longer look at the world in quite the
same way. The meat on my plate now
had an accusatory voice. It was
Gandhi’s. And it would not take my
history of indifference as an answer.

As a piece of reasoning, Gandhi’s
argument seemed unassailable. Give
him his premises and you couldn’t avoid
his conclusion. The problem was, I was
not prepared to give him his premises,
one of which included his commitment
to paciﬁsm. And so I set myself the task

’We Are All
Noah.’

 

 

of thinking about the moral status of
vegetarianism in ways that did not rely
on Gandhian paciﬁsm. My ﬁrst pub—
lished essay relating to animal rights,
“The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism,” is

NATURE REBELS:

UNDERSTANDING WEAKNESS

Probably everyone who reflects on the life he or she has
lived up to a given point in time is struck by how chancy
it all seems. Consider my case. Suppose my family had
never moved from Pittsburgh’s North Side: Would I have
gone to college? Very unlikely. But even if I had, would I
have gone to Thiel College? More unlikely still. And that
means that in all probability I would not have met either
Bob Bryan or my wife. How very unlikely then, that I would

 

have gone to the University of Virginia to study philosophy.
Or grown into the person who wrote The Case for Animal ‘

.
' ' , v

' t" the Muvcmcui fUTAuimal Right? I can never
think of my past without being overwhelmed by how much
of what has happened to me (and this includes the very best
things) was due to factors quite beyond my control. I try to
remember this when I meet people whose ideas and values
differ significantly from my own. “There but for a series of
contingencies go I,” I think. This helps me in my battle
against self-righteousness. And in my efforts to be patient
with people who are just entering the Movement as well
as those who currently are outside it. How little of what we
are and what we will become is within our power to control.
And so it is that I look back uncertainly at that self I once
was. I see the boy playing on Pittsburgh’s streets, unmindful
of the aged, mistreated mare pulling an overloaded wagon
of junk and old iron, the/\na-as-te'i‘s whip whistling angrily
over her weary head. I watch the teenager running his
hands over a butchered side of beef without giving it a
second thought. And I observe the aspirant Virginia Cen—
tleman listening indifferently to another’s anguish concern-
ing a solitary dog used in practice surgery, his own mind
preoccupied with loftier worries about Plato’s theory of
Forms. And in every case I wonder, not superficially but
down to the very depths of my being, if there is not the
slightest hint, the most minuscule portent, of what my future
was to be, or where my thought would and must lead me.
Is it all a matter of luck? Of chance? Of accident? Was there
nothing in me that directed my growth from within?
There is, perhaps, one hint of my destiny all but hidden
in the blur of my boyhood memories. I was born with what
has come to be called a “lazy” or “weak eye.” Other names
for my condition are “cock-eyed” or “cross-eyed.” It is not
a condition a boy could easily ignore. Others, especially
ones antagonists, delighted in reminding one of the defect.
I am told that some Native American peoples viewed cross—

 

 

 




Other major constituencies cry out for attention. The
Animal Rights Movement is only one part of the larger
movement for social justice. It must begin to align itself
with other parts —— with the Peace Movement, for example,
and the Greens; with organizations tryviji Rtflntd missing
children and those working to help battereésu'vvcs; and with
still other groups who labor for justice or East Asians,
Blacks, Chicanos, and other minorities. Representatives of
these and other groups must be a part of our Movement’s
campaigns and rallies. And the same is true of the working
class. I am a product of that class and have deep loyalties
and affection for those who cOmprise it‘. The Movement
must learn how to reach out to these decent men and

I hope I will find ways to help those who are working for this same
goaL

Because I am not a pacifist, I am committed to the belief that the
use of Violence sometimes is justified. For some ARAs, Violence
necessitates that a sentient being is harmed. If you blow up a
building and on one is hurt, no violence is done.

This distorts rather than clarifies the notion of Violence.
Someone who burns down an abortion clinic or torches a mosque
does some serious violence even if the structures are empty.
Specifically, then, when the Animal Liberation Front or the Earth
Liberation Front engages in arson and other forms of proper
destruction, what they do is Violent. When they deny this, they avoid
the truth rather than speaking it.

I believe the vast majority of ARAs agree with me when I say,
”The violent actions of ALF and ELF are not acceptable; they do not
represent my values.” Gandhi never leveled buildings in pursuit of
his objectives. Martin Luther King, Jr. never vandalized property in
the name of justice. When the opportunity arises, especially at
meetings of ARAS, I plan to speak-up for the Gandhian principles I
think should guide our movement.

Of course, forswearing the use of violence does not mean we
must forgo active protest. When Ijoined other ARAs in the
nonviolent occupation of NIH, I certainly did not think that I was
doing nothing. Our problem is not that we have too many nonviolent
ARAs who are willing to go to jail'as the price of civil disobedience.
Our problem is that we have too few. The day may come when we
are able to fill the jails with nonviolent ARAs. I hope so. Our
movement is unlikely to triumph if that day never dawns. In the

surgery, which is now routine for very young children with
a lazy eye, was not in vogue back then. What was recom-
mended were exercises, and these were done with the aid
of a mechanical device at the ophthalmologist’s office. And
so off I went to try to strengthen my weak eye.

The device was constructed as follows: If you looked
through the right lens, you saw a bird. And if you looked
through the left lens, you saw a cage. People with normal
eyes who looked through both lenses at the same time saw
the bird imposed on the cage, which gave the appearance
that the bird was in the cage. I saw things differently. In
my case, because of my weak left eye, the bird always ap—
peared to the right and slightly below the cage. Sometimes,
when I concentrated as hard as I could, the bird seemed

to move closer to the cage. But try as I might I never coal-el—

And do. Try as I might my nature would not permit me to

 

see the bird in the cage. Something in me rebelled against
seeing things this way. Others saw the bird as captive. I
could only see the bird as free. And that, in its way, is a
prophetic metaphor of what I have become.

terms when I meet people who are not yet a part of the
Animal Rights Movement. Like Socrates I see my role in
these encounters as being that of the midwife, there to help
the birth of an idea already alime just waiting to be delivered.
I have some sense that this A rue in my case; the early
evidence is there in my natural inability to see the bird in

then there was the "suggestion" that the invitation should be revoked
because I was a prime suspect in the recent murder of a researcher,
shot dead in his drive way. There is more, but I'm sure you get the
drift. Let's just say these folks were not laying out the welcome mat.

Not a word of what they said is true; all of it is pure ﬁction. It
just goes to show the lengths to which/experts who don't like the idea
of animal rights sometimes will go ins'their attempt to discredit those
who would dare to disagree with them.

”THERE’ S A HOLE IN THE MOVEMENT”

The Animal Rights Movement is so varied in its membership
and programs that it will never have one leader. No, the movement
goes forward because of the efforts of many hands, on many oars.
Much of this work involves recruitment: attracting new people.
Another part requires educating ourselves about our deep cultural
roots—in philosophy and poetry, art and sculpture, music and dance.

Moreover, we must continue to add to this body of cultural
resources, not just rest content with those we already have. Back
some 20 years ago, when Nancy and I looked around, we discovered
that no one was helping make this happen. Right at its center, there
was a hole in the movement.

The need to fill this hole was what motivated the creation of
The Culture and Animals Foundation. Now entering its 20th year,
CAF is a tax-exempt, nonprofit, all volunteer organization that raises
and distributes money to fund three programs: research, creativity,
and performance.

Over the years, CAF has funded hundreds of ”cultural
activists”(as we call them) and hosted an annual International
Compassionate Living Festival, working collaboratively with the
Institute for Animals and Society in 2004. Thousands of people have
attended, always returning home with passions stirred and minds on
fire. Watching CAF’s birth and growth, with the assistance of current
board members Marion Bolz, Rondi Elliot, and Jean Hollowell, has
been a source of great pleasure and satisfaction for Nancy and me.

”PUT UP OR SHUT UP!”

There comes a time in everyone’s life when the sincerity of our
commitment is on the line. For me, that time came in the summer of
1985. That’s when I decided it was time to get arrested. Here‘sthe
background. -

In May of this same year members of the Animal Liberation
Front ”liberated” more than 70 hours of videotape of research being

‘I am the voice of the voiceless;

Through me the dumb shall speak

Till the deaf world's ear be made to hear .

The wrongs of the wordless weak.

From street, from cage and from kennel,
From stable and 100, the wail
Of my tortured kin proclaims the sin

Of the mighty against the frail.

Oh, shame on the mothers of mortals
Who have not stopped to teach
Of the sorrow that lies in dear, dumb eyes,

The sorrow that has no speech.

The same force formed the sparrow

That fashioned man the king;
The God of the whole gave a spark of soul

To furred and to feathered thing.

And I am my brother's keeper

And I shall fight his fight

And speak the word for beast and bird
Till the world shall set things right.

received a more or less steady stream of
Ds and ES for my early compositions.
This gave me second thoughts. Perhaps
the Muse I was listening to spoke in
dangling participles? I even managed to
ﬂunk Spanish. Elementary Spanish at
that. Believe me, I thought long and hard
about quitting more than once.

But then—and this was perhaps the
most important event in my early years
as a prodigal scholar—I stopped wear-
ing socks. You need to understand: back
then, no one, I mean absolutely no one,
went sockless. Back then baring your
ankles in public was the social equiva—
lent of walking around in your under—
wear. Moreover, as I embarked on my
sophomore year, I stopped going to
class. In a course in English Novel, for
example, I showed up twice. Once for
the mid—term. Once for the ﬁnal. When I
received a B+ for the course, who could
doubt that I was above the common
fray? I was becoming somebody. As my
parents scrimped and saved, I spent my
time burnishing my public image by not
wearing socks, not going to class, stay—
ing up to two or three in the morning
winning pocket money at poker and
bridge, playing in dance bands and cOm—
bos, and (on most days) sleeping well
past noon.

In retrospect, I count my lucky stars
in the knowledge that, throughout this
period of my life, my parents never
knew I was wasting their hard-eamed
money as I squandered opportunities
they could never have imagined.

TO AVOID HISTORY: A PHILOSOPHER
IS BORN

A crisis occurred during my junior
year. I was an English major at the time
and to complete the required course of
studies I was obliged to take a full year
of English history as well as a year of
United States and Pennsylvania history.
This was like asking me to spend hours
lounging on a bed of hot coals. What-
ever talents and interests I may have had

at this time, the study of history did not
nourish or answer them. Fortunately for
me, the forces of serendipity took charge
of my life—not for the ﬁrst or the last
time.

Thiel was just about to introduce a
new major in philosophy. I had taken a
few philosophy courses by then and was
pleased to discover that a subject actual—
ly existed where people discussed the
questions I increasingly was inclined to
ask on my own. In addition, my profes-
sors in philosophy showed an interest in
me that was lacking in most of their
counterparts in English. I would like to
be able to say that I decided to major in
philosophy because of my commitment
to pursue Truth, whatever the cost. But
the really decisive factor in my decision
to change was far more banal. This new
major in philosophy did not require any
classes in history over and above those I
had already taken.

That much settled, the decision was
easy. I was to be Thiel College’s ﬁrst—
ever philosophy major. It was a decision
made in the stars. During my senior year
I was virtually a straight A student, bare—
ly graduating, however, because of a D
for the second semester of Elementary
Spanish. I doubt if I could do any better
today. Many are called but few are
chosen to Elementary Spanish.

By the time of my graduation from

It is rto exaggeration to say that,
aarirtg the past thirty years, philoso-
phers have written vastly more ort
the topic of ethics and aairaals than
oar predecessors had written in the
previous three thoasaaa.

 

Thiel I had abandoned any desire I may
once have had to prepare myself for the
ministry. I didn’t know where I was
headed. My summer employment as a
counselor at a YMCA camp was fulﬁll-
ing. Another summer’s apprenticeship in
a local butcher shop was not. This was
not because I found butchering ethically
intolerable. I had no moral qualms what-

So (we ask): Is the struggle for animal rights really like other
struggles for social justice? Unquestionably. All we have to do is

identify our common enemies. I have history to thank for teaching
me that.

FINDING A NEW VOICE

The past four years have been uncommonly productive and
rewarding. A collection of my essays, Defending Animal Rights,
appeared in 2000, followed by my contribution to The Animal Rights
Debate (2001), another contribution to Animal Experimentation: Good or
Bad? (2002), and Animal Rights, Human Wrongs: An Introduction to
Moral Philosophy (2003). Even as this work was published, as far back
as 1997, I worked on two other books, one a general introduction to
moral theory (still maturing somewhere in my brain) and another, for
the general reader (which took too many wrong turns and has been
abandoned). It was not until August of 2002 that something dramatic
happened, don’t ask me why. But happen it did.

It was my habit at this time to go to my office in the library and
spend five or six hours working on the two books Ijust mentioned. (I
had retired from the NC State faculty in January 2001 and had time
on my hands). Sometime in August, another book asserted itself. I
mean this quite literally. The new book took charge of my life, in
ways analogous to what happened when I wrote The Case for Animal
Rights. Only this time, the writing was not easy. This time, the
process of writing was sheer agony. I have never worked so hard on
anything in my life. I understood why, but that didn’t help.

The ”why” was simple. I was trained to write the way those I
studied wrote. George Edward Moore, for one, than whom no more
plodding writer can be conceived. This (the Moorean) voice was how
I put words on the page whenever I sat down to do any ”serious”
writing. The demons behind the new book would not hear of it.
Moore’s ponderous, analytic style was to be silenced. A new voice
was to be heard. The only problem was, the old Tom Regan was
standing in the way.

So each day I went to my office. Each day the old voice fought
to be heard. And each day this new voice refused to cooperate. The
contest lasted 9 months, the length of an average pregnancy, before
Empty Cages: Facing the Challenge of Animal Rights was finished.
Reading its chatty, conversational tone, you would think it had to be
a much easier book to write than The Case for Animal Rights. In fact,
just the opposite is true; the latter wrote itself; the former was like
getting blood from a turnip.

 




 

 

 

 

ON THE HOG INDUSTRY

Turning pigs into commodities, the deliberate reduction of them into mere things, characterizes the
mindset of the industry. ‘The breeding sow should be thought of, and treated as, a valuable piece of
machinery,’ advises a corporate manager of Wall’s Meat Company, ‘whose function is to pump out
baby pigs like a sausage machine.’ Say what
you will, the hog industry is mighty good at
this. (Empty Cages, p. 96).

ON "RANCHED" MINK

[According to F W Commission USA, mink
raised on fur ‘ranches’] are treated ‘humanely,’
meaning with compassion, kindness, and
mercy. In fact, they are ‘the best cared—for live—
stock’ in the world, a statement that, tragically,
just might be true. Compared with veal calves,
hogs, and chickens raised in confinement,
those lucky mink who spend their waking
hours pacing back and forth, jumping up the sides of cages, and rotating their heads, are leading a
country club existence. May God forgive us. (Empty Cages, p. 110).

ON (M AND DOG FUR

Beginning in 1987, Americans were outraged when the Humane Society of the United States exposed
the international trade in cat and dog fur, especially when they learned that garments in American
stores were trimmed or lined with fur from these animals . . . Cats and dogs should not have their fur
stolen from them, Americans protested. It’s their fur; it belongs to them, not to us. Animal Rights
Advocates could not agree more. To kill cats and dogs for their fur is both uncivilized and unethical.

Animal Rights Advocates could not agree more. It’s just that we think the same is true when the fur
is stolen from any animal. (Empty Cages, p. 118)

ON THE CANADIAN SEAL HUNT

Despite ofﬁcial assurances to the
contrary, many seals are skinned
while still alive. It would be a relief
to learn that this happens rarely,
though of course it should not
happen at all. The bad news is, it
happens a lot. An independent
scientiﬁc study, conducted in 2001
by a team of veterinarians, conclud-
ed that 42 percent of the seals were
skinned alive. That works out to
approximately 130,000. (Empty
Cages, p. 115)

The same insensitivity I showed
toward Jock’s fate I exhibited in the face
of another’s emotional anguish. At the

determined to get ahead with his career.
Even so, he did not like what he was
required to do to a dog in his class in
surgery. He described to me how he
broke the poor animal’s leg and then set
it, only to break and set it again.
Throughout her long, painful ordeal the
loyal animal greeted his arrival with a
wag of her tail and even licked the very
hands that had injured her.

In the end, he was required to “euth-
anize” the dog. It did not sit well with
him. He thought it cruel and unneces—

 

sary. He wanted to speak out, to object,
but he lacked the courage. He wondered
what sort of human being he was or
would become. He even questioned

whether he should make a career of
medicine. In all this I believe he was as
sincere as any person can be. It hurt him
to hurt another, even a dog.

For my part I was too much involved
in understanding Plato’s Theatetus and
withstanding the insults of my peers to
ﬁnd time to empathize with this medical
student, let alone a dog. I wish I could
say that my ethical sensitivities regard-
ing animals have always been highly
developed. The sad truth is, they have
not. The story about this dog bothered
me no more and no less than the story
about Jock. Animals were not on my
moral map.

lOVE AND COMPANIONSHIP

Among the truly major blessings in
my life was my marriage to my wife
Nancy on June 17, 1961. We remain
indissolubly wedded, committed to our
mutual growth. We are different people
now than we were when we first met
back in my sockless days at Thiel, and
perhaps it is as much a matter of luck as
it is of our love for one another that we
have managed to develop in ways that
have brought us closer together rather
than driving us farther apart. Sometimes
we even seem to look alike, impossible
though this is—she of Lithuanian and
Austrian blood, her face showing the
strong beauty of her Eastern European
ancestry; I of sturdy Irish stock, ruddy of
complexion, stump-nosed. How very
fortunate we are to have settled perma-
nently into one another. There is so
much more one can do with one’s life
after the questions of a soul mate and
lifetime companion have been answered.

Early on in our marriage we pur-
chased a miniature poodle. We called
him “Gleco,” after the name of a compa-
ny we drove past every day. Nancy was
an instructor in Special Education in the
public schools. I was taking my gradu-
ate seminars. We lived in two rooms on
the second ﬂoor of an older farmhouse
about thirteen miles from The Uni—
versity.

The landlady was a strong-willed but
friendly Southern woman. She permit-

ON ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION

On a daily basis, animals are drowned, suffocated and starved to death; they have their limbs severed
and their organs crushed; they are burned, exposed to radiation, and used in experimental surgeries;
they are shocked, raised in isolation, exposed to weapons of mass destruction, and rendered blind or
paralyzed; they are the given heart attacks, ulcers, paralysis, and seizures; they are forced to inhale
tobacco smoke, drink alcohol, and ingest various drugs, such as heroine and cocaine. And they say
Animal Rights Advocates are violent? The violence done by Animal Rights Advocates (almost all of
it taking the form of property destruction) is nothing compared to the violence done by the world’s
vivisectors, a raindrop compared to an ocean. Just because a profession is legal, perhaps even (as in
the case of vivisection) prestigious does not mean it is nonviolent. On a day-to-day basis, the great—
est amount of violence in the world occurs because of what humans do to other animals. That the
violence is legally protected only serves to make matters worse. (Empty Cages, p. 189)

ON |.IONS AND TIGERS TRAINED TO PERFORM IN CIRCUSES

An opportunity to expand animal consciousness presents itself if we look behind the eyes of wild
animals trained to perform in circuses. In the wild, the home range for African lions and Indian male
tigers varies from 8 to 156 square miles; for Siberian male tigers, up to 400 square miles. For the sake
of comparison, consider that San Francisco and Boston occupy 47 and 48 square miles, respective—
ly; Chicago, 227; New York City, including all ﬁve boroughs, 309 square miles. No sensible person
can believe that circuses provide lions and tigers with a caged environment of ‘sufficient space,’ one
that offers the animals ‘adequate freedom of movement.’ (Empty Cages, p. 127)

ON GREYHOUND RACING

Day—to-day life for racing greyhounds is characterized by chronic deprivation. Dogs are confined in
small crates, some measuring three feet by three feet. On days when they are not racing, the animals
can be crated for up to twenty-two hours, sometimes stacked in tiers. Except when eating, they are
muzzled . . . As for why they are muzzled, the explanation is an expression of the industry’s com-
mitment to humane treatment. After all, if their muzzles were removed, the dogs could injure their
mouth, teeth, or gums when they gnaw on their wire cage. In other words, the industry’s remedy for
one kind of deprivation (keeping the dogs caged) is to impose another kind of deprivation (keeping
them muzzled), the better to treat them more humanely. (Empty Cages, p. 156)

ON 'HUMANE' SLAUGHTER

Symbolic of the ‘humane’ treatment animals receive at slaughterhouses is the plight of so-called
downers. These are animals who are so sick or so badly injured that they cannot stand up or walk.
Depending on conditions at the plant, downers can lay on the ground for a day or more, without
water, food, or veterinary care. Whether dead or alive, eventually they are pulled inside the slaugh-
terhouse by chains or hoisted by a forklift. A Zogby poll found that 79 percent of the adults inter-
viewed opposed the slaughter of downers. Not the dairy industry, which lobbied vigorously to
delete legislation before the Congress in 2001 that aspired to ban the sale of downers. Why would
the dairy industry oppose such minimal legislation? Because most downed animals are dairy cows
who can be slaughtered for their meat after they no longer can produce milk. (Empty Cages,
pp. 100-101)

how my training as a moral philosopher could be applied
to the questions that were being asked about the war. Ought
we to be there? Was the war a just war? Is violence ever
justified? Once the logic of these questions took root in my
mind they acquired a life of their own. I was along for the
ride-of—ideas. Or so it now seems. As strange as it may
sound, the immediate ancestor of my views about animal
rights was my first crude attempt to come to terms morally
with the war in Vietnam.

If I had to be more precise and try to fix a particular time
when the ride-of-ideas began in earnest, I would say it was
during the summer of 1972. It was then that I was the
beneficiary of a Summer Grant from the National Endow-
ment for the Humanities. My plan was to think about
pacifism —— the view that it is always wrong, no matter what
the circumstances, to use violence, whether in self—defense
or aggressively. The conclusion I reached then, and the one

®

part because of what Gandhi was and not only because of

what he said that he exercised such an uncommon power
over me. This simple, fragile, apparently unsophisticated
man, against all the odds and contrary to every sensible
expectation, became a major actor on the world’s political
stage, expressing in his own life the principles of love and
justice he would have a free, independent India express in
hers. How extraordinary! Even now I cannot help feeling
that Gandhi was as close to many of the most important
moral truths as any mortal is likely to be. The difference is,
he managed to live them.

In any event it was during this particular period, during
the summer of 1972, that Gandhi began to raise my con-
sciousness about the place of animals in the moral scheme
of things. His Views on vegetarianism were both simple and
of a piece with his more general views about right conduct.
The practice of ahimsa (frequently translated “nonviolence”)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sharing the day with other activists.

I still hold now, is that occasions can and do arise in which
the individual is morally justified in using Violence. To do
so in many cases of course may be foolish, but it is not
immoral just because imprudent. I was not then, and am
not now, a pacifist.

Now, no one who sets out to think about violence and
pacifism can do the work that needs to be done and not
read Gandhi. And read him I did: hundreds and hundreds,
even thousands of pages of his simple prose. This in itself
was remarkable. I have never been an energetic reader. I

does not stop at the borders of Mspecies. Morally
we are called upon to minimize our casual role in the use
of violence in the world at large, even when animals are
victims. And since we can lead an active, healthy life without
either killing animals ourselves or partaking of the products
of the slaughter performed by others, duty requires that
we refuse to eat meat. We must be vegetarians. That in very
simple terms is what Gandhi teaches.

Once I had digested it I could no longer look at the world
in quite the same way. The meat on my plate now had an
accusatory voice. It was Gandhi’s. And it would not take
my history of indifference as an answer.

As a piece of reasoning Gandhi’s argument seemed unas-
sailable. Give him his premises and you couldn’t avoid his
conclusion. The problem was, I was not prepared to give
him his premises, one of which included his commitment

 

 




 

to pacifism. And so I set myself the task of thinking about
the moral status of vegetarianism in ways that did not rely
on Gandhian pacifism. My first published essay relating to
animal rights, “The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism,” which
was published in the Canadian journal of Philosophy in
October 1975, is the tangible result of the line of reasoning
I began to investigate in the 315mg? Q49 2 and which I
completed early in the!5 ooking back at
the essay today I see much in it I would‘ change I think
the argument goes badly wrong in a number of places, and
the style is too plodding. But I like the sense of rational
determination and fair- mindedness evident between the
lines. The ride- of—ideas had begun. There was no getting off.

THE DEATH OF A FRIEND:

THE IMAGINATION AWAKENS j/

But there was another event in my life that helped change
it irrevocably, and this one had nothing whatever to do with
philosophy or theory. This was an affair of the heart, not
the head. And it also took place in that momentous summer
of 1972.

Nancy and I, and our two children, Karen and Bryan,
who then were one and five respectively, had taken a vaca-
tion at the beach. On the very day we returned home Gleco
was killed — hit by a car while darting across a road.
Whether the driver. or the person in whose care we left
; Gleco was at fault will never be known All that we knew
‘ at the time was that a dear friend was dead. Faced with
l that ugly fact, Nancy and I lapsed into a period of intense,
shared grief. For days we cried at the mere mention or
memory of Gleco’s name, unable fully to articulate our sense
of loss. Earlier that summer, while thinking about Gandhi
and pacifism, I had encountered the rude question of the
ethics of meat eating. Once severed from any essential con-
nection with pacifism, J the rational arguments seemed
to be thereqiL-t-hwg-h-t- My head had begun to grasp a
moral truth t at required a change in my behavior. Reason

demanded that I become a vegetarian. But it was the sense

of irrecoverable loss that added the power of feeling to the .

requirements of logic.

en this occurs I fee as if I am ,

e "1 ovement stillTit ..

 

L

What Gleco’s death forced uporﬁe was the realization
that my emotional attachment to particular dog was a
contingent feature of the world. Of my world. Except for a
set of circumstances over which I had no control I would
have loved some other dog (jock, perhaps, or the poor
creature at the mercy of the med student I knew). And
given some other conditions over which again I had no
control I would never have even known Gleco at all. I
understood, in a flash it seemed, that my powerful feelings
for this particular dog, for Gleco, had to reach out to include
other dogs. Indeed, every other dog. Any stopping point
short of every dog was, and had to be, rationally and emo-
tionally arbitrary. And not just dogs, of course. Wherever
in the world of animals there is a psychology with which to
empathize, a personality whose welfare can be affected by
what we do (or fail to do), there the feelings of love and
compassion, of justice and protection must find a home.
From this point forward my heart and head were one, a
union. Philosophical argument can take the heart to the
river, but perhaps it is only experience that can make it
drink. he intellectual challenge before me was to try to
make Ila-if n? of the world less vague and the grounds

for accept ng it rationally more compelling. That 1n general km”-

was the task I set myself and at E? h I woﬂ<ed more or
less continuously during the of my life.

Paradoxically, however, when I look back on the process of

writing, Empty Cages today seems like another gift given to me, only
' this time from some other source. I am so grateful that I was able to

. . .bring it to fruition. Easy to read, if not to write, I harbor the hope that

it will reach a much larger audience than The Case and that, in
combination with the work of others, it will help revitalize the animal
rights movement, returning it to that magical time between the 1985
occupation of the NIH and the glorious day when tens of thousands
of ARAs marched down Pennsylvania Avenue.

FOOTPRINTS

Except for 2 years at the beginning of my professional life, my
home has been North Carolina State University. The University has
been good to me, in many ways. Although I was an outspoken
proponent of animal rights on a campus where students take degrees
in animal agriculture and where hundreds of faculty use animals in
their research, I was never punished or threatened for speaking my
mind or teaching what I taught.

Just the opposite. The University has honored my work,
presenting me with every award for teaching and research for which
I was eligible, culminating in receipt of the William Alexander
Quarles Medal, the highest honor the University can bestow on one
of its faculty.

During my ﬁnal years of teaching, I made a special effort to try
to give something back to the University in return for all I had
received. Three projects stand out. First, I volunteered to chair a
Committee on the First Year, the main objective of which was to
create enriched educational opportunities for students entering my
college, the College of Humanities and Social Sciences. On the basis
of the committee’s recommendations, every first year student in
CHASS now has aspecial seminar in which vital ideas, including
race and class, gender and sexual Orientation, are explored. These
First Year Seminars are a permanent part of the college’s educational
mission.

Second, I was asked to chair a special committee on Research
Ethics for the graduate school. After obtaining a grant from the
National Science Foundation, the committee crafted a plan that will
shape instruction in ethics, for every graduate student at the
university, throughout the 21St century.

Third, before retiring from the university, representatives of the
University Library approached me to ask whether I would consider

 




THE ANIMALS VOICE

[Dream ta

 

 

THE LIFE AND TIMES OF
TOM REGAN

 

 




On the hog industry

”Turning pigs into commodities, the deliberate reduction of them into mere
things, characterizes the mindset of the industry. ‘The breeding sow should be
thought of, and treated as, a valuable piece of machinery,‘ advises a corporate
manager of Wall’s Meat Company, 'whose function is to pump out baby pigs
like a suasage machine.’ Say what you will, the hog industry is mighty good at
this.” (Empty Cages, p. 96).

On ”ranched” mink

”[According to Fur Commission USA, mink raised on fur ’ranches’] are treated
’humanely,’ meaning with compassion, kindness, and mercy. In fact, they are
’the best cared-for livestock’ in the world, a statement that, tragically, just
might be true. Compared with veal calves, hogs, and chickens raised in
confinement, those lucky mink who spend their waking hours pacing back
and forth, jumping up the sides of cages, and rotating their heads are leading a
country club existence. May God forgive us.” (Empty Cages, p. 110).

On the Canadian seal hunt

”Despite official assurances to the contrary, many seals are skinned while still
alive. It would be a relief to learn that this happens rarely, though of course it
should not happen at all. The bad news is, it happens a lot. An independent
scientific study, conducted in 2001 by a team of veterinarians, concluded that
42 percent of the seals were skinned alive. That works out to approximately
130,000.” (Empty Cages, p. 115)

On cat and dog fur

”Beginning in 1987, Americans were outraged when the Humane Society of
the United States exposed the international trade in cat and dog fur, especially
when they learned that garments in American stores were trimmed or lined
with fur from these animals . . . Cats and dogs should not have their fur stolen
from them, Americans protested. It’ 5 their fur; it belongs to them, not to as.
Animal Rights Advocates could not agree more. To kill cats and dogs for their
fur is both uncivilized and unethical. ARAs could not agree more. It’s just that
we think the same is true when the fur is stolen from any animal.” (Empty
Cages, p. 118)

On lions and tigers trained to perform in circuses

”An opportunity to expand animal consciousness presents itself if we look
behind the eyes of wild animals trained to perform in circuses. In the wild, the
home range for lions varies from 8 to 156 square miles; for male tigers, from 8
to 156 square miles (in India) and up to 400 square miles (in Siberia). For the
sake of comparison, consider that San Francisco and Boston occupy 47 and 48
square miles, respectively; Chicago, 227; New York City, including all five
boroughs, 309 square miles. No sensible person can believe that circuses

 




provide lions and tigers with a caged environment of ’sufficient space,’ one

that offers the animals ’adequate freedom of movement.”’ (Empty Cages, p.
127)

On dolphins trained to perform in marine parks

”[When free] dolphins swim up to forty miles a day and can dive to depths of
more than a quarter mile. In their natural environment, they live in extended
social groups (pods)and find their way around in an ever changing,
challenging environment via echolocation. (They ’see’ by hearing). Once in
captivity, these animals are confined in concrete tanks (sometimes measuring
as little as twenty-four feet long by twenty-four feet wide by six feet deep) or
in small sea-cages. There are no pods here. Nothing changes in any significant
way in this desolate world. No natural challenges are faced. Nothing naturally
interesting is found because there is nothing naturally interesting to be found.
To speak candidly, it is worst than disingenuous; it is shameful that anyone
would stand before us and say, ’We really and truly care about the welfare of
our dolphins,’ animals who have nothing to locate, no family to be with, no
place to dive, no miles to swim.” (Empty Cages. P. 137)

On sport hunting

”When all the rhetorical dust settles, the real rush for the sport hunter comes
from the kill. Any doubt about this, just look through any of the hunting
magazines at the local newsstand. The hunters pictured in those pages,
displaying their dead wares, smiling from ear to ear, could not be happier. If
we asked them to pose with beanbag chairs, it just wouldn’t be the same.”
(Empty Cages, p. 149)

On calf roping

”[In rodeos] calves can reach speeds up to thirty miles an hour before they are
lassoed (’clotheslined’); often they are jerked over backward and slammed to
the ground . . . The faster they are running at the time, the harder they are
pulled backward. And the harder they are pulled backward, the more their
necks are wrenched and the greater the force with which they hit the ground.
Some calves do not do encores. It’ 3 one performance and out. . .So here we
have today’s brave cowboy, bending over and tying up a frightened, dazed,
disoriented baby (the animals are all of four or five months old), with neck
and back injuries, bruises, broken bones, and internal hemorrhages. Are those
who are working to abolish rodeo in general, calf roping in particular, just
overwrought, emotionally unbalanced calf huggers?” (Empty Cages, p. 152)

On animal experimentation

"On a daily basis, animals are drowned, suffocated and starved to death; they have
their limbs severed and their organs crushed; they are burned, exposed to radiation,
and used in experimental surgeries; they are shocked, raised in isolation, exposed to

 




weapons of mass destruction, and rendered blind or paralyzed; they are the given
heart attacks, ulcers, paralysis, and seizures; they are forced to inhale tobacco
smoke, drink alcohol, and ingest various drugs, such as heroine and cocaine. And
they say ARAs are violent? The violence done by ARAs (almost all of it taking the
form of property destruction) is nothing compared to the violence done by the
world’s vivisectors, a raindrop compared to an ocean. Just because a profession is
legal, perhaps even (as in the case vivisection) prestigious does not mean it is
nonviolent. On a day-to-day basis, the greatest amount of violence in the world
occurs because of what humans do to other animals. That the violence is legally
protected only serves to make matters worse." (Empty Cages, p. 189)

On Greyhound Racing

“Day-to-day life for racing greyhounds is characterized by chronic deprivation.
Dogs are confined in small crates, some measuring three feet by three feet. On days
when they are not racing, the animals can be crated for up to twenty-two hours,
sometimes stacked in tiers. Except when eating, they are muzzled . . . As for why
they are muzzled, the explanation is an expression of the industry’s commitment to
humane treatment. After all, if their muzzles were removed, the dogs could injure
their mouth, teeth, or gums when they gnaw on their wire cage. In other words, the
industry’s remedy for one kind of deprivation (keeping the dogs caged) is to impose
another kind of deprivation (keeping them muzzled), the better to treat them more
humanely.” (Empty Cages, p. 156)

On Animal Rights Advocates

“With rare exceptions, Animal Rights Advocates are for love of family and country,
for human rights and justice, for human freedom and equality, for compassion and
mercy, forpeace and tolerance, for special concern for those with special needs
(children, the enfeebled, the elderly, among others), for a clen, sustainable
environment, for the rights of our children’s children’s children—our future
generations. In a word, the vast majority are Norman Rockwell Americans, straight
off his famous Thanksgiving cover for the old Saturday Evening Post, only with this

noteworthy difference. We’ll pass on the turkey, thank you. We don’t eat our
friends.” (Empty Cages, p. 19)

On ‘Humane’ Slaughter

“Symbolic of the ‘humane’ treatment animals receive at slaughterhouses is the
plight of so-called downers. These are animals who are so sick or so badly injured
that they cannot stand up or walk. Depending on conditions at the plant, downers
can lay on the ground for a day or more, without water, food, or veterinary care.
Whether dead or alive, eventually they are pulled inside the slaughterhouse by
chains or hoisted by a forklift. A Zogby poll found that 79 percent of the adults
interviewed opposed the slaughter of downers. Not the dair industry, which lobbied
vigorously to delete legislation before the Congress in 2001 that aspired to ban the

 




APHORISMS
From The Struggle for Animal Rights

”Fundamental moral wrongs are not alterable by future results. Or past
intentions." (p. 106)

”T he struggle for animal rights is not for the faint of heart.” (p. 107)

”Eternal vigilance is required no less from us, to protect the basic rights of
nonhuman animals, than it is required of everyone, if we are to protect the basic
rights of human beings.” (pp. 108-09)

”Ethical progress is never easy. We would be better at it, if it were.” (p. 109)
”T he world grows weary of militance and meanness." (p. 111)

”T he old adage, ’You can’t legislate morality,’ may be true. But we are in deep
legal and moral trouble if we can’t legislate justice.”

From Empty Cages

"[W]hat happens to us after we die does not help us understand why we have
the rights we do while we are alive.” (p. 48)

1’Great people are not above making great mistakes." (p. 49)

”Morally considered, a genius who can play Chopin etudes with one hand tied
behind her back does not have a ’higher’ rank than a seriously mentally impaired
child who will never know what a piano is or who Chopin was.” (p. 51)

”T he role of veterinarians in the legitimzation of standard practices in the major

animal user industries is an unspeakable tragedy, their betrayal is so great” (p.
82)

”T he money someone makes by violating another’ 3 rights is never moral reason
enough for doing so.” (p. 124)

”If we think lions, tigers, elephants, and dolphins belong in c: ~~ es and marine
parks, how could we possibly see anything wrong when thi _ arm? Why else
would they be there?” (p. 139) "

”T he rights of animals should never be violated so that some people can have a
good time or because others make a comfortable living from doing so.” (p. 139)

“You don’t motivate people to become more compassionate toward animals b
showing a lack of compassion toward humans in hard times." (p. 185)

 




”Animal Rights Advocates have no reason to be self-righteous, as if the world
were divided into the Pure (that would be us) and the Impure (that would be the
rest of humanity). Morally, we are all shades of gray.” (p. 186)

”[People] should not be deterred from moving forward on their journey because
someone else doesn’t understand where they are on theirs.” (p. 187)

”T he violence done by Animal Rights Advocates . . . is nothing compared to the

violence done by the major animal user industries, a raindrop compared to an
ocean.” (p. 189)

"It is the propaganda machines of the major animal user industries that have
made violence and animal rights synonymous in the minds of many people. It is
these machines that have been doing (and are continuing to do) a special interest
mind job on the American people.” (p. 192)

“[T]he verdicts of history teach that entrenched social practices not only can
change, they have changed. But never without a struggle." (p. 193)

”Every Animal Rights Advocate has something to contribute to the animal rights
movement. And not just any old something. What each person contributes is
something special, something needed.” (p. 193)

From Animal Rights, Human Wrongs

”Rights involve justice, not generosity; what we are due, not what we want.” (p.
27)

”To attempt to determine which humans have rights on the basis of race is like

trying to sweeten tea by adding salt. What race we are tells us nothing about
what rights we have.” (p. 27)

”T 0 act in ways that are respectful of individual rights is to act in ways that are
respectful of the individual whose rights they are.” (p. 75)

”T he end of sexual satisfaction never justifies the means of sexual coercion.” (p.
98)

”A prudent morality enjoins us to act on what is true, not on what might be.” (p.
102)

”We do not need to know everyth' g before we can know something.” (p. 103)
'15 all“

l’Asking who has an immorta _ is as logically irrelevant to asking who has rights
as asking who has blond ha' 0 missing teeth.” (p. 104)

”Whether our preferences are evil is not something to be decided by determining
how strenuously we deny that they are.” (p. 116)

By the time sf my graduation {rem This} 1 had abandoned. any desire i
may once have had tea prepare inyseif fer the ministry. i didn’t knew
where i was headed. My summer enrpieynient as a ee'anseier at a YMCA
camp was fi‘iiﬁiiiilg. Anether summer’s apprenticeship in a lecai butcher
shop was net. This was not because i {send butchering ethicaiiy
inteierabie. i had an India}. anaims 'wi'iatever abnnt preparing the ground
meat, making ei.ty-ehici<en, stocking the eeidmcat section, fixing; the minute
steaks, or skewering the Chickens for the retisserie. Fifty hands were deep
into the cei‘pses nf animate, but i. was stnne deaf in their cries. ff. didn‘t like
my apprenticeship because the weric was ten biendy hard, net because it
was ten iiieed y. My days in the butcher‘s trade were nmniiered. Bat net
for any thing; iiice the right reasens.

As my graduation freni This}. aprirnaehed i. interviewed fer a variety of

idea ef grad nate sciiaei was even more incemprehensibie its me Whiiei
was in ceiiege. ”What was a grad nate scheei?" i Siiﬁﬂdfﬂ‘ed. "And what did

i didn‘t have the "right" ideas abent Where 'biacks 'heienged in the.

And as it was that during the summer at 3.96% i app} ied for admissien in

THE i’iﬂdhﬁ: FIDDLiNC-i ‘WiTt-i MY PKGPESSION

My education at Virginia was more or toes typicai of the time. "Anaiytic
phiiosophy” was the dominant approach to the discipiine in piaus iiite
'UV'A that had a strong British presence. ’i’he riding preocctipatioi‘i in morai
phiiosophy. which is where my interests naturaiiy Zed me, concerned

questions about the proper anaiy sis of concepts.

My spirit bent to what my teachers required. i wrote my h-iaster‘s 'i‘hesis
on the concept of beauty and my PhD. 'iﬁissertation on the concept of
goodness. [is a true protessionai my concerns were strictiy anaiyticgi

this time and in that piace it was not the business of. a phiiosogoher to taice
a morai or aesthetic stand on anything. To do so was beneath the
inteitectuai dignity of the profession. i practiced What i heard preached.

After my graduation, when i embarked on. my teaching career, my ciasses

America was at war in "ii’ietnain. And that fact changed a great deai,
ineiuding the direetien of my inteiieetuai deveiepment.

Something had to give. And. since it was beyond my pin-titer tn stop the war
{thengh \anv and i worked poiitieaiiy to heip end it}, .i. decided ta
approach things from the phiiesnphieai side nght we to be there? Was

the tear a just war? is vioienee ever justified? [is strange as it may snund,

the immediate aneestnr at my Views about animai rights was my first
tirade attempt to eoi‘ne to terms moraiiy with the war in Vietnam.

iii had. to he iniiire precise and try in fix. a partieuiar time when the ride~oi~
ideas began, i wenid say it was during the summer at 19172. it was then
that i W-Z-Si the beneficiary of a Summer Grant from the Nationai

the view that it is aiways wrong, no matter what the eireumstances, to use
vioienee, whether in seitwdeiense er aggressiveiy. "the eonciusion 1 reached

then, and the. one i stiii hoid, is that eeeasions Can arise in which the use of
vioienee is justified. i was net then, and am not new, a pacifist.

New, no one who sets out to think about vieienee and paeitism can do the
werk that needs to he dene and not read Gandhi. And read him 'i' did;
hundreds and hundreds, even thousands of pages at his simpie prese.
This in itseit was remarkable. i have never been an energetic reader. i envy
peopie {Nancy is one at them} who are. Espeeziaiiv during the next twenty
years or so, when iwrete mare and more, i read iess and tees. Except, as i
say, in the ease nt Gandhi. i read him with enormous energy and
dedication.

it was during this particutar period, during the summer of 1972, that
{Sat-idhi beget-i. tn raise my eonscieusmess about the piaee of animais in the

iwas not prepared to give him his premises, one of which included his
commitment to paeit’isin. And so it set inyseit the task of thinking about the.
rnorai states of vegetarianism in ways that did not rei'y on Gandhian
paeitism. My first pahtished east 3,: reiating to animai rights, "The h/iorai

THE BERG iii THE CASE
ToniRegeh

BEGENE‘HNGS: A KID Cit“- Ti'iE STREETS

i was horn and raised in Pittsburgh, hennsyiyahia w» "the Burgh“ as we who
have iiyed there eaii it. Aithongh i have not had a oerrnanent residence
there for more than forty years i stiii consider hittsborgh my home. The
hurrah sets its roots deep in those who have known it. The City gets in your
hiood. You can‘t do away from horne again.

The house where i soent the first fifteen years of my iiie fronted Ceiifornia
Avenue, a busy thoroughfare on the oityis North Side: ﬁoes-ianes or" traffic,
two troiiey iines. it cotiid get hectic: We never oieyed haii on Caiii’ornia
ayenoe° Eeyond the traffic there was a share drop to a ieyeied space some
fifteen feet heiow the street, A dozen train tracks siiced their way to the
horizon, Yon. cooid not see the trains, either from the street or horn the
second story windows of our house. But their reientiess presence was the
most dominant aspect of daiiy iiiegihis was before diesei engines,
Everything was steam, That means coai-oowered ~i’he air was fiiied with
great shrines of grayish white srnoke and ohosohorescent Cinders that
gioweri in the night air. Passenger and freight trains hurried by, their
whisties waiiing throughout the day and oh the night. Everywhere there was
the crashing sound of cars being eoooied anti nneonoied on the home.
Great iihes of cars, hundreds at a time ...... freight and oii, iiatbecis and eattie
- were strung together by the siriiied workmen, ’i‘wentydoor hours a day,
seven days a week, every day of every month you heard the sound of
heavy rhetai.

Eyeryone who iiyed aiohg this sorawiing artery that iinired the coat mines of

west Virginia to the steei miiis of Pittsburgh heionged to the raiiroadi This

was true even when, as in my tarniiy’s case, no one worked for it, The soot:
and smoke invaded your eyes and ears, your nose and month, the eiastie
around your underwear and the ciothes in your dresser. When you tooit a
hath, a hreadywderk hiaoir ring remained inthe tnh after you drained it, a
reminder, iest one forget m how torrid one‘ﬁm of the eianging worid outside,
iziy neigi'ihorhood was a ohiid‘s paradise, a piece where a ind torrid itiX'Lii‘iaiIti‘
in the steamy dirty of indostriai orhan iiying.

(f 5': £71,

That neighborhood is aii hot gone now. The house where i was raised has
been demoiishedi in feet the entire i’hiock of houses now is an open iieid, foii
of weeds and wiidiiowerso Even the raiiroad is aii but idiei Most of the
houses that remain have been boarded no, condemned try the City as
uninhabitaoie. i'iiihen I drive through the neighborhood today, grown siient
and aii out deserted, i am a ghost in a ohoshtown. No one from my niooth ' ,
remains, Viewing the fading shrouds of what was once a vibrant '

5 / A
You need to understand: back then, no one, I mean absolutely no one, went
sockless. Back then baring your ankles in public was the social equivalent of
walking around in your underwear. Moreover, to embellish my public persona, I
stopped going to class. In a course in English Novel, for example, I showed up
twice. Once for the mid-term exam. Once for the final exam. When I received B+
for my final grade, who could doubt that I was above the common fray? When I
attended Thiel, it cost $1,000 a year, including room and board. As my parents
scrimped, saved and sacrificed, I spent my time burnishing my public image by
not wearing socks, not going to class, staying up to three or four o’clock in the
morning winning pocket money at poker and bridge, playing in dance bands
and combos, and (on an almost daily basis) sleeping well past noon.

It gets worse. To consolidate my adolescent sense of Self, I ran for student
body president. In this reallife theater of the absurd, I was the ”anti” candidate.
Roughly speaking, I was against everything the college was for. The results were
not even close. The vast majority of students had the good sense to vote for
Anybody-but-Regan. After being buried in the election and (to my consternation)

not named to Who’s Who (the most prestigious honor society of my era), I knew

I had arrived. I mean, if everyone was against me, they must be jealous. Right?

Talk about self deception.

So, there I was, in my late teens. And who was I? In my rejection of social
norms, I identified myself with the likes of Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, a
true son of the Beat generation. What a relief this identification with other
outsiders was for me! Only some really rare and gifted person would bare his

ankles in public and cut classes as if they were beneath him. I liked this role. I

began to believe in myself again. I was somebody. In retrospect, I count my lucky

stars in the knowledge that, throughout this period of my life, my parents never

knew I was wasting their hard earned money as I squandered opportunities they

could never have imagined.

decision made in the stars. During my senior year I was
virtually a straight A student, barely graduating, however,
because of a D for the second semester of Elementary
Spanish. I doubt if I could do any better today. Many are
called but few are chosen to Elementary Spanish.

By the time of my graduation from Thiel I had abandoned
any desire I may once have had to prepare myself for the
ministry. I didn’t know where I was headed. My summer
employment as a counselor at a YMCA camp was fulfilling.
Another summer’s apprenticeship in a local butcher shop
was not. But this was not because I found butchering ethi—
cally intolerable. I had no moral qualms whatever about
preparing the ground meat, making city-chicken, stocking
the cold-cut section, fixing the minute steaks, or skewering
the chickens for the rotisserie. My hands went deep into
the corpses of animals, but I was stone deaf to their cries.
I didn’t like my apprenticeship because the work was too
bloody hard, not because it was too bloody. My days in the
butcher’s trade were numbered. But not for anything like
the right reasons.

As my graduation from Thiel approached I interviewed
for a variety ofjobs: selling insurance for Sears; serving as
a Youth Counselor for a suburban branch of the YMCA;
pursuing a career in marketing for H.]. Heinz. These inter-
views were glorious fiascos. It did not take me long to learn
that I was a round peg trying to fit into square holes. And
it didn’t take my interviewers long to realize this either. I
knew quite well what I did not want to do. The problem
was to find the round hole that answered my needs and
interests. I already had postponed a vocational decision four
years beyond the point of anyone else in my family, including
all of my relations on both sides. Not only was I the first
one on either side to graduate from college, I was the first
one to attend. I felt a great deal of anxiety about the need
to do something with my life. People had been patient with
me long enough. But what could a person do who had a
bigger appetite for reading Kant than for selling Heinz’s
ketchupPThat was the question whose answer eluded me.

If the idea of college was mysterious to me while I was
in high school, the idea of graduate school was even more
incomprehensible to me while I was in college. “What was
a graduate school?” I wondered. “And what did a person do
there?” I had only the foggiest idea. But as my job prospects
dwindled (I was eliminated from consideration for the
YMCA job because I didn’t have the “right” ideas about
where blacks belonged in the particular branch 'whem—I—
a-p-p-l-iedf They belonged outside I was told) — a'skmy job
prospects dwindled, I had to do something. And so it was
that during the summer of 1960 I applied for admission to

of Virginia, to continue my study of philosophy. Twob
before the first class —— (at least this is my recollection —
I received a letter informing me that I had been accepted
“conditionally.” This meant I was admitted but that my status
would be re—evaluated on the basis of my work during the
first semester. There was, after all, enough evidence'of
mediocrity on my college transcript to rattle anyone’s confi—
dence. Thank heavens my major professor at Thiel was a
graduate of Virginia. Had it not been for the inﬂuence and
guidance of Robert S. Bryan at this time I may well have
ended up selling collision insurance for Allstate. And this
is not the least of my many debts to Bob Bryan. Him

STILL UNSETTLED: THE UNIVERSITY YEARS

My graduate career at Virginia began inauspiciously enough.
I was blue collar in my background. The students I met all
seemed to be Blue Blood in theirs. Virginia had no female
students at the time and we Gentlemen (as we then were
called) wore coats and ties to class. I had one suit and two
ties. I was the kid without socks who spills soup on his pants
to the delight of the country club set. Or so it seemed. I
remember well a young man in my Plato seminar, a graduate
of St. John’s College in Annapolis, where the education
consists of reading and discussing the Great Books, many
of which I had never heard of, let alone read. We were
walking across the Grounds, having just passed the famous
Rotunda designed by Thomas Jefferson, heading toward the
Corner. Earlier in our seminar we had been discussing
Plato’s Theatetus. I couldn’t make much sense of the
dialogue and was rash enough to say so. Others seemed not
to find the material difficult. Stopping abruptly, my compat-
riot looked me squarely in the eye. Taking his pipe from
his mouth (the smoking of a pipe, I discovered, was an
essential mark of an educated Gentleman, one I tried to
acquire, albeit unsuccessfully) and speaking with an affected
British accent, he said, “Began, you strike me as a man to

whom it will not be difficult to say goodbye come the end
of your first and, dare I say, your only semester.” Then he
placed his pipe back in his mouth and walked away, leaving
me transfixed on the spot where I stood.

I was shattered. Here I was, a kid off Pittsburgh’s streets,
trying to make an honest go ofit at Mr. Jefferson’s University.
And here was this ]. Press son-of—privilege putting me in
my place, telling me that I didn’t belong. And who was I
to deny that he was right.P Didn’t I think his very thoughts
myself? Socially and intellectually this was the lowest point
of my life. It took me months to begin to regain any
semblance of self—confidence. But in time I did, and though
I am not a particularly vengeful or spiteful person I must

 




COMES THE REVOLUTION:
CHANGES IN THE WORLD OF IDEAS

In 1972 an unknown philosopher submitted an unsolicited review of a
previously unnoticed book to The New York Review of Books. The book was
Animals, Men and Morals: An Enquiry into the Maltreatment of Non-Humans, a
collection of essays edited by Roslind and Stanley Godlovitch, and John Harris.
To the reviewer's surprise, his review was accepted and, in April 1973, appeared
in this prestigious publication.

Reader response was overwhelming. The Australian-born, Oxford-
educated philosopher opened the eyes of many readers to some of the terrible
things being done to animals. The editors of N YRB understood that this was
something special, so special in fact that they took the unprecedented step of
offering to publish a book on the topics covered by the reviewer if he was
interested in writing one. He was. A contract was tendered and the book was
written. The philosopher's name: Peter Singer. The title of his book: Animal
Liberation. The rest, as they say, is history.

As it happened, I had an opportunity to teach at Oxford during the
summer of 1973. I had read Singer's review and wrote to him, explaining that we
shared many of the same interests. While I was in Oxford, we met several times.
We agreed that an anthology of mainly philosophical writings on our duties to
animals would be both timely and useful. Over the next two years, we sent our

suggestions back and forth to one another; by the fall of 1975, we had a final

manuscript. We even had a title: Animal Rights and Human Obligations. Our next

challenge was to find a publisher.

So off I went to the annual meeting of the Eastern Division of the
American Philosophical Association. One of the major textbook publishers had a
reception to which I was invited. After introducing myself to the philosophy
editor, I handed him a copy of the prospectus Singer and I had put together. The
