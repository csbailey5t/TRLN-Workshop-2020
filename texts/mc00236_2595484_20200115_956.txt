DEFINITIONS FOR OUR TIME
(After reading a letter by David Romtvedt)

MARE

There will be no mare
grazing in this field,
her chestnut flanks
sun bright and

silk under my hand.

PASTURE

No pasture either, with
its stream winding between
maples and aspen.

No russian thiStle'

to comb out of

the mare's tail.

EARTH

The earth may not be able
to support any but the most
rudimentary life forms.

ACCEPTABLE CASUALTIES

10, 20, or even 60 million dead.

RECOGNITION

It would be impossible

to recognize anything. ’
The concrete floor of the barn
would be ash.

BIRDS

They will melt
as they fly upward.

MEMORY

There would be no one
to remember the mare
gazing out of the sides
of her luminous eyes.

BARBARA WINDER

 




I am a Keeper of Rabbits

My favorite wears a white triangle
between eyes, lies quietly, pops
vertically, twists summersaults in air.
Parts his hair delicately with forepaws.

My grey lop—eared rabbit

has a habit of stopping short,

propping herself up, listening for danger,
arranging herself carefully for a nap.

We venture out in all weather

for picnics and prancing. Relaxing
at noon, we lounge on our backs.
Greeting the half—moon we dance!

At night we lie eye—to—eye

by a fire, hind legs thrust out
in abandon, admiring the humanity
between us.

Let us not seek to make it less monstrous,

for our own convenience, our own sense of beauty,

lest, awakened in one unthinkable hour, we are embarrassed by the
miracle, I . ‘

Cosmic Gall

Every second, hundreds of billions of these neutrinos pass through each square
inch of our bodies, coming from above during the day and from below at
night, when the sun is shining on the other side of the earth!

From ‘An Explanatory Statement on Elementary Particle Physics’,

by M. A. Ruderman and A. H. Rosenfeld, in American Scientist

Neutrinos, they are very small.
They have no charge and have no mass
And do not interact at all.
The earth is just a silly ball
To them, through which they simply pass,
Like dustmaids down a drafty hall
‘ Or photons through a sheet of glass.
, , They snub the most exquisite gas,
Ignore the most substantial wall, .
Cold-shoulder steel and sounding brass,
Insult the stallion in his stall,
And, scorning barriers of class,
Infiltrate you and me! Like tall
And painless guillotines, they fall'
Down through our heads into the grass. '
At night, they enter at Nepal
And pierce the lover and his lass
From underneath the bed - you call
It wonderful; I call it crass.

Experimental

Choose a maple wing,
dry and gray if you prefer.

Holding it between thumb and foreﬁnger,
with the other thumbnail

split

the casing.

Delicate as spring green, folded,
miniature, -

a life waits to unfurl ,

and journey toward the sun.

You have ruined it.

ANNE STEVENSON
(b. I933)

The Spirit is Too Blunt an Instrument

The spirit is too blunt an instrument

to have made this baby.

Nothing so unskilful as' human passions
could have managed the intricate
exacting particulars: the tiny

blind bones with their manipulative tendons,

the knee and the knucklebones, the resilient
fine meshings of ganglia and vertebrae ' '
in the chain of the difficult spine.

I

He waits for dusk

to begin the slow waddle
through bramble

to street.

Carries seeds of wild grass
tangled in his hair,

and his back streaked

with dew from the field.

He totters across to houses
still with night.
Noses lawns, thick as winter fur,
then rolls to rub the rough
from his coat
and rest against the sweet rump
of summer.

II

I smell him.
Startled to musk,
his odor seeps like a warning

past locked doors

and shut windows.

He comes nights,
pitching my sleep

with dreams of wildness.

I know that field across the street,
have felt the briars

which tear clothes and claw skin

if you move too quickly.

.And that rich clutter of root and vine

which snarl and snag any path-formed foot.

It's such unyielding disorder—— ’
it's all the sweet heat of life.

( Camels in Persia >

Along the caravanroutes go the camels tall: *' * *
Forward-ﬂung friezes of night, for they travel at nightfall,
Outward going, onward,

And the sound of their bells thrown forward

Makes a rhythm no man can recall

To his ears in the silences afterward.

But he knows that the camels stride

Hunched up on a night scarce purple for many stars;
He knows that the camels are tied

Together in strings, are padding their way to Fars.

 

The leading camel is great, has a long underlip,

A rank red beard on his throat, and a suretiship,

A manner of turning his head to look at a stranger
Who grinds in his Ford to Fars;

He sneers as all camels sneer as he passes the dead
Arched white ribs of his kind, and nothing said,
Caring for nothing but excellent leadership.

The camel is sullen and proud, he is not my friend,

Will have none of my fellowship. ,

Soon he knows he will fail, he will fall by the way

And his caravan pass, and leave him to vultures, but now
He knows he will drink his ﬁll at the iourney’s end,

And be at peace by the palms in the heat of the day.

He knows he will fall by the way,
And lie as all camels lie when he comes to die,
With the insolent pride of the camel,
Watching his caravan wend toward the evening end
‘ In beautiful dignity onward,
The sound of the bells ﬂung forward-—
Over the Plain of Passagardae where the black irises
Spring from the shale and slate—-

Fats] region situated on the Persian Gulf; the original home of the Persians, who derive their
name from it

A POEM FOR TRAPPED THINGS

This morning with a blue flame burning

this thing wings its way in. .

Wind shakes the edges of its yellow being.
Casping for breath.

Living for the instant

Climbing up the black border of the window.
Why do you want out.

I sit in pain

A red robe amid debris,

You bend and climb, extending antennae.

' I know the butterfly is my soul
and weak from battle.

A giant fan on the back of

a beetle.
A caterpillar, Chrysalis that seeks
a new home apart from this room.

And will disappear from sight

at the pulling of invisible strings.

Yet so tenuous, so fine

this thing is, I am

sitting on the hard bed, we could

vanish from sight like the pull

off an invisible cigarette.

Furred chest, ragged silk under
wings beating against the glass

no one will open.

The blue diamonds on your back
are too beautiful to do
away with.
I watch you
all morning
long
With my hand over my mouth.

prepares us early on by indicating her
uncertainty about her relationship
with Spencer Tracy: “Did he leave
because he was bored or did he leave
because he couldn’t bear to say good-
bye? The eternal question.” You know
where this memoir is heading when
she writes, “John talked. I don’t even
remember what he talked about but it
was magic.” '

“The Making of ‘The African
’ ” is about Hepburn’s intense
involvement with Huston, and the
“and almost lost my mind,” in the
title, is her pointing up that she knew
he was impossible, but was smitten
anyway. (He was forty-four and well
known to be a charmer monster;
she was forty-three.) During a break
in the ﬁlming, Huston decides to
go hunting for elephants; this is
Hepburn’s account of her reaction:

I thought to myself, Well! The probabil—
ity is that I will never be here again. And
rather than loll about the hotel, I think
that I would like to go with John. Spiegel
nearly had a ﬁt. And quite right he was.

“Katie—setting off with John in a little
plane—how can you—how? You may be
killed. Then what . . . ?"

“Well, John may be killed.”

“The hell with John. I can’t control
John, you know that. But you. . . . You're a
reasonable, decent human being.”

“Yes, Sam—I have been—and I don’t
think it pays. I want adventure—I want to
hunt elephants with John. Not to kill, just
to see." ~

”Oh my God, Katie. Talk to Bogie. . . ."

Bogie came.

“Katie, what's happened to you? You're
a decent human being.”

”Not anymore I'm not. If you obey all
the rules you miss all the fun. John has
fun.” ‘

”John," says Bogie. “That son of a bitch
has gotten to you.”

”He’s seeing Africa.”

"You’re making a picture."

“Yes, I'm making a picture, but I’m
seeing life at the same time."

“She’s gone,” he said to Sam. “Under
the Spell."

. . . That night I worked on John’s
clothes. His pants—ﬂy—buttoned——-had no
buttons. I got - some buttons and sewed
them on. They had just rotted off in the
damp. Next morning we left.

Viertel’s novel provides a much
fuller account of the elephant hunt.
But at the start of the novel he has
already been through. the seduction
Hepburn is experiencing, and her im-
pressionable romanticism is outside
his range. Her Yankee reticence is

blended with an actress’s dizziness._

Here’s her account of a night when
she has been violently sick, and the
crew, which has been carousing, tries
to serenade her:

But I was past serenading and they ﬁ-
nally went to bed. And funny old John.

 

What did he do? He came back to my
cabin.

“Just stay a’sleep, Katie dear. Stay
asleep. Asleep—asleep . . .” And he rubbed
my back with his smooth, strong hands.
And my head and my neck and my hands
and my feet. Such a blessing. Took the
trouble from me. It is true——the laying on
of hands. So quiet—~30 sweet—soothing.
He was gentle. I slept. I don’t remember
when he stOpped. Dear friend.

I don’t know that I would read this
sort of gush by anyone else. But this is
Katharine Hepburn writing about her-
self and John Huston; it’s an icon
showing herself in a new light, and it '
has an element of giddy surprise. So do
a couple of the photographs and the
captions she has written. On page 104,
she sits smiling blissfully, with Huston
leaning over her shoulder—his face
is ardent, he might be inhaling the
perfume of her hair. And the caption
is “Oh, John. Isn’t he sweet?” On
page 122, they’re on a bike together,
both smiling, and the caption is “On
John’s bike . . . I’ve obviously lost
my mind.” (To know why it was
madness, one should read the Viertel
book.) i

We don’t ﬁnd out what happened——
only that, returning to London, “John
and-I had a paperback, ‘Miss Har-
greaves,’ which we were reading.
We read the whole novel on the trip
back. Good part for me. We bought
it. We never made it.”

The frog who works out

First Warm Days

April, up on a twig a leaftuft stands

And heaven lifts a hundred miles mildly

Comes and fondles our faces, playing friends——

Such a one day often concludes coldly—

Then in dark coats in the bare afternoon view

Idle people—we few who that day are—

Stroll in the park aimless and stroll by twos

Easy in the weather of our home star.

And human faces—hardly changed after

Millennja—the separate single face

Placid, it turns toward friendly laughing

Or makes an iridescence, being at peace.

We all are pleased by an air like of loving

Going home quiet in the subway-shoving.

It beat the shapes of harps into the air.

Adlestrop

Yes, I remember Adlestrop—

The name—because one afternoon

Of heat the express-train drew up there
Unwontedly. It was late June.

The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.

On the bare platform. What I saw

Was Adlestrop—only the name-—

To the Snake

Green Snake, when I hung you round my neck
and stroked your cold, pulsing throat
as you hissed to me, glinting
arrowy gold scales, and I felt
the weight of you on my shoulders,
and the whispering silver of your dryness
sounded close at my ears—

Green Snake—4 swore to my companions that certainly
you were harmless! But truly
I had no certainty, and no hope, only desiring
to hold you, for that joy,
which left
a long wake of pleasure, as the leaves moved
and you faded into the pattern
of grass and shadows, and I returned
smiling and haunted, to a dark morning.

with half-closed eyes,

Discoveries in Arizona

All my life so far
I have been afraid
Of cactus,
Spiders,
Rattlesnakes.

The tall fourteen-year-old boy
who led me through

The desert whispered, Come over
this way.

Picking my steps carefully over
an earth strangely familiar,

I found four small holes large
enough

For a root that might have been
torn out

Or a blacksnake hole in Ohio,
that I hated.

What is it, I said, some cute
prairie dog,

Or an abandoned posthole,
maybe?

No, he said, she’s down there
with her children.

She doesn’t hate you, she’s not
afraid,

She’s probably asleep, she’s
probably keeping warm

With something I don’t know about,

And all I know is sometimes in
sunlight

Two brown legs reach out.

It is hard to get a look at
her face.

Even in the museum she turns away.

I don’t know where she is looking.

I have lived all my life in
terror

Of a tarantula,

And yet I have never even seen

A tarantula turn her face

Away from me.

That’s all right, said the boy.

Maybe she’s never seen you either.

I clench his feathered legs together
like a jilted suitor clings
to a limp bouquet. All his love
nocturnal, in a nightmareless life,
he could not foresee, even with ball-
turret vision, the existence of so much
sterile light and steel: this Great
Gray Owl in shock, deflated,
on a veterinarian table, one wing-
bone, Jagged as glass pipette,
broken in two.

His eyes, dull bulbs
to the brilliance of this room,
beam nothing of his ominous lore,
iis fury at our pluck and probe° Humiliation
quells his outrage for mangled plumes
preened quill by quill
to perfection, each barbule'
softly muffling the owl's swoop—-this ruffled
breadth of feathers that hid his frailness
for so little flesho

The vet threads

metal pins into the shattered
air-as-marrow miracle, little hope
hollow bone will knit at all, let alone
knit with struts enough for flight. The owl,
exposed and marred, wilted
by so much light, leaves his body
to our last-ditch, taxidermic bid
for immortality, We'll never know
what secret love, what spirit locked within
quill and bone, kept this bird
eternally in blossom—~crest feathers
petaled like phlox, ten thousand wings
soaring gorgeous for the dark.
