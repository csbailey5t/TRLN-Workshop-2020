Thanks for yOur letter and the enclosed resolutiOn having
'to do with 3.1071 and HR 561w.

With reference to the legislation that you discuss, you ',
know, I am sure, that in the past I have always supported legislation
that would provide humus consideration and treatmnt for all anim‘la
used for testing purposes. I am against cruelty that is so often dis-
closed with reference to animals that are used in some experiments. '
You may be assured that I will continue to support humane legislation

Dear Mr. Mays:
Thank you for your recent letter.

I am.glad to know that you and.your family are
working in support of S. 1071 and H. R. 5647 dealing with
the prdblem.of humane treatment of animals used.in medical
research.

Anyone in public Office must take abuse and, some-
times, undeserved abuse. But some things he does not need.to
take. I really had no choice. I simply could.not remain silent
when some people, by vicious falSehOOd, were attempting to destroy
my character. The radical reactionary right in the United States
poses a danger for our country. It is constantly seeking to under~
mine faith in government and in public servants. Anyone who dis-
agrees With its fanatical beliefs is in danger of unfair attack and
abuse. The time for all decent, reasonable citizens to stand up
against the radical right is certainly here.

With kindest regards,
fmig Sincerely youri,

Dear Mrs. La Roche:

This is to thank you for taking the time to write as you did
concerning legislation now before the Congress regarding the treatment
of animals used in experiment and research.

Representative Claude Pepper introduced legislation in this
field on January 18th, H. R. 3036, which calls for the humane treatment
of animals used in certain grant-recipient laboratories. The measure is
pending at this time before the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce
Committee with no action scheduled for it. However, as of this writing,
no bill of this nature has as yet been introduced into the Senate.

Ever since I can remember, our household f ly has always
included a dog, and it is difficult for me to comprehe ' any deliberate
harm'being done through laboratory experiments. I sympathize with those
who are concerned over inhumane treatment. On the other hand, the ex-
periments being conducted by these laboratories aid all humanity in its
desire to overcome disease.

Your views are well taken and I anIgrateful that you took the
time to express your personal thinking on this matter.

Sincerely,

a we.

Dearlirs. Steub:

This is to thank.you for your correspondence in which
you discuss your thoughts relative to legislation now before the
Congress regarding the treatment of animals used in experiment
and research.

There is legislation.pending before both the Labor
and.Public Welfare Committee in the Senate and the interstate
and Foreign Commerce Committee in the House. Neither Committee
has as yet scheduled any action for its pending bills. I am
a member of the Senate Labor Committee and so will have a.first—
hand opportunity to closely watch this legislation.during the
committee’s deliberations.

Ever since I can.remember, our household family has
always included a dog, and so I can.sympathize with those who are
concerned over inhumane treatment of experimental animals. On
the other hand, the experiments being conducted by these lahom
retories aid all humanity in its desire to overcome disease.

Your views are very much appreciated and.I am glad you
took the time to share them with me. They will certainly be kept
in.mind.

Sincerely,

Dear Mrs. Hall:

It was extremely good of you to let me have your
thoughts on legislation relating to humane treatment
for experimental animals.

this matter and have eggsis£gg§$ymﬁgg£§gWEQQLWifaﬂﬁwgﬁgw

has never seen fit to report the bills from committee so
that we could debate the isSue on the Senate floor. It
is my hope that we will be given an opportunity to con-
sider legislation in this subject sometime during the

89th Congress.

 

Thanks again for writing, and best regards.

Mrs. Charles H. Watson

Dear Mrs. watson:

Thank you for your letter expressing your concern about the treatment
of research animals, and the policy of the FCC on religious broadcasting.

Legislation concerning the treatment of research animals has been
introduced this year in the Senate (as well as in the House) ~- S. 1071,
a bill to provide for the humane treatment of animals used in government-
financed research and, S. 1087, a bill to establish minimum.standards for
the humane care and treatment of animals used in research. These bills are
being considered by the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee, of which
I am not a.member. You may be sure that if this legislation is brought

before the Senate, I shall give it careful consideration, keeping in.mind
your interest.

In reference to your statement on the policy of the FCC on religious
broadcasting, a recent decision by the Commission in the matter of new
licensees maintained that there was no mandatory requirement that time be
made available to religious groups. Evidently, the brunt of the argument
is resolved by religious groups qualifying as public service broadcasting.

I am glad to enclose a copy of S. 1592 and a statement on firearms.
It is good to hear from you.

‘With best wishes.

Eaithfully,

Jamaica Estates, New York

Dear.Mrs. Kimbrell:

Thank you very much for your letter expressing con-
cern about the treatment of animals involved in laboratory
experiments, and for your recommendations on legislation
in this area.

As you know, Senator Clark has introduced a bill,
S. 1071, which would require, among several features, the
Secretary of Health, Education, and welfare to license
establishments which house animals for experimental pur-
poses. Although I do not serve on the Labor and Public
welfare Committee to which this bill has been referred, you
may be assured that I shall give this legislation,my clos-
ggggattention should “it come to the Senate for a vote. "I
believe that animals in laboratories should be given the
uggt h;'[ e treatment possible without hampering progréSS
in the field of responsible scientific research.

I certainly appreciate your taking the time to write
me on this important matter and look forward to receiving
your thoughts and suggestions in the future.

Si erely,

Birch Bayh

Dear Mr. Stringham:

I have your letter and I want to thank you for writing
to me about legislation which has been introduced in the Congress
to provide for the humane treatment of laboratory animals. I be-
lieve as you do that they should be spared unnecessary suffering.

Several years ago,gmwintxnﬂnggg,thewgirggybill ever intro-
~duced in either Housemgf Congress to prOV1de for the humane treat-
"ment of animals used in Scientific experiments. At that time, I was
a member of the seas te Committee on Labor and Public Welfare which
has jurisdiction in this matter, and I worked on my bill for over a
year. However, I could not even secure hearings on it.

 

I have found, however, that as a result of the COOper bill,
medical schools and hospital laboratories have taken voluntary steps
to care for the animals they use for research, and this is a good
sign. Also, my bill has become the legislative precedent for the
introduction of humane treatment bills in subsequent Congresses, and
with the continuing interest in this subject, there may be a better
chance now that hearings will be held.

I hope you will continue to write to me about matters be»
fore the Congress in which you are interested, as I always appreciate
your views.

With kind regards, I am

Sincerely yours,

Thank you for your letter of Febucary 17 in which you

treatment of vertebrate animals used in experiments and tests by
recipients of grants from the United States and by agencies and
instrumentalities of the U. 5. Government.

This proposal is presently pending before the Senate
Committee on Labor and Public Welfare and no action has been taken
on this proposal and I am advised that none is scheduled at the
present time. The companion measure in the House, H. R. 3036, is
pending before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce and no action has been taken, or scheduled, by that Com-
mittee.

You may rest assured that I will study very carefully
the final version of any bill of this type which may come before
the Senate and will bear in mind your views. I assuremygumthat
I also believe in the humane treatment of these animals. ,

Please give my sister~in~ law my best when you next see

Dear Miss Ohe:

Thank you for your recent communication regarding
humane treatment to experimental animals.

Several bills on this important matter
have been introduced and referred to Committee, but
Committee review has not been completed and the legisla-
tion has not taken shape for final action.by the Senate.
At this time I think it best to reserve judgment until the
Senate's deliberations are finished, because any promising
proposal clearly involves attaining a delicate'balance
between the need for extensive research and humane respect
for animal life.

I will give the subject the thorough study it
deserves and you can.be assured that your views Wlll
receive my sympathetic consideration.

Again thank you.for writing. I very much appre~
ciate having the benefit of your thoughts.

proposals and recommendations for insuring humane
treatment of experimental animals. Please know that
I will keep your particular interest very much in mind
