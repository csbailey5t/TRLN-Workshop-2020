Barroom bear wrestlin

West Bank bureau

 

The barroom bear wrestling
matches held recently in J effer-
son Parish were illegal, parish an-
imal shelter officials said

Wednesday.

Bert Smith, humane education
director for the Jefferson Parish
Animal Shelter, said the bear’ s
owners, Rip and Ann Tyler of
Gadston, Ala., did not obtain a
permit for any of the shows
staged 1n Jefferson Parish.

The owners also may have vio-
lated the parish animal cruelty
ordinance, and for that reason
won’t be granted a permit if they
return, Smith ‘and animal shelter
director Casey Burglass said.

“It goes against what we’re try-

in Jefferson

ing to do, which is to convince
people animals need to be re-
spected and allowed to live
unmolested,” Smith said.

The matches pitted a live, 500-
pound bear named Terrible Ted
against challengers from the au-
dience. At least three matches
were held in Jefferson Parish in
the last two weeks, one each in
Westwego, Grand Isle and Crown
Point.

State ofﬁcials Wednesday said
the Tylers were also in violation
of state Department of Agricul-
ture regulations requiring a
health certiﬁcate on exotic ani—

- mals transported across the state

line.

Smith said Jefferson Parish re-
quires owners of any traveling
animal exhibit or show to get a

«Mama»;

permit for each day the show op-
erates in the parish.

Failure to do so carries a ﬁne
up to $500, a maximum six
months in jail or both.

“If they come back, we will
write them up for not having a
permit,” Burglass said.

Burglass and Smith said the
bear’ 3 owners will be denied a
permit if they apply for one be-
cause bear wrestling apparently
violates the parish’s animal
cruelty laws.

Parish laws prohibit mistreat-
ment of animals and require the
use of “every reasonable precau-
tion . . . to ensure that animals
are not teased, abused, mis-
treated, annoyed, tormented or in
any manner made to suffer,”
Smith said.

“The owners would probably
say he (the bear) loves to wrestle.
I don’ t think he loves it,” Smith
said. He said the bear’ 3 behavior
at a show recently 1n Westwego
was evidence that he does not
love it.

During the show held at the
New Old Fireman’s Hall, a West-
wego nightclub, handlers momen-
tarily lost control of the bear as it
was being led out of the building.

It charged back toward the
dance ﬂoor and climbed partially
on top a table, forcing two people
seated at the table to flee and
knocking over drinks and chairs.

Outside, the owners needed
help from a Jefferson Parish
sheriff’s deputy and‘another man
to get the bear back into a horse
trailer it lives in while on tour.

THE COMMER(

dogs poisoned in.

livestock man says it’s pest control

 

By Lawrence Buser
Staff Reporter

 

A half dozen dead dogs found over the weekend
is: ra cornfield east of Shelby Forest were poi-
.511" according to nearby residents, who say

a 3; two dozen dogs and an assortment of ani-
E ina2s have died similar deaths in the same area
: during the past two years.

“It‘s getting a little out of hand,” said Jim Farris,
who found the dogs —— one of which was his —- Fri-
day off Hines Road and Cuba-Millington Road. “It’s
like a graveyard.”

 

:JIAL APPEAL

The “graveyard” is on property owned by W. 8.
:Babe’ Howard. Howard does not acknowledge us-
ing poison but admits to shooting numerous dogs
that have ventured onto his land, Where he keeps
livestock, including Moufon sheep from Sardinia
and fainting goats, a breed that scares easily.

“I’ve lost 150 goats and 40 sheep and I will kill
every dog that comes on my place,” said Howard, a
former Millington alderman, school board mem-
ber and head of the Millington Telephone Co. “If I
can catch their dog on my place I’m going to kill
them one way or another.”

He said when two pit bulls killed eight of his

goats, he shot one five times before it died and had

to beat the other with his empty shotgun when it
attacked him. Howard estimated his livestock
losses at several thousand dollars.

“They’re duck soup for (predators),” said How-
ard, noting he is plagued by wild dogs, hunting
dogs, pet dogs and coyotes. “That stuff gets old. I’m
the one being persecuted. No one’s offered to pay
one penny for my livestock that’s been killed.”

Farris and two neighbors —— Jim Stamatis and
Jim Campbell -— acknowledge that observing the
county leash law may have kept the dogs from be-
ing killed, but they say Howard never gave warn-
ing before acting, a contention Howard disputes.

The three say they have found poisoned meat
near the carcasses of dogs on Howard’s property.
They note that such meat kills indiscriminantly
and endangers wildlife.

“All these dogs were, family pets,” said Farris.
who likens the area to “a death zone.” “If we don’t
do something, then one day we’re going to find a
kid” poisoned. ‘

Wildlife OfficerRonald Shannon of the Tennes—
see Wildlife Resources Agency said he knows of no
law against using poison on one’s own property,
though he added “we discourage any use” because
it causes painful death to all wildlife.

Howard said dogs and other animals will be safe
if they just stay off his property. —

“They can holler poison, they can holler what
they want but if their dog gets on In property I’m
going to do my best to kill (the dog), ’ said Howard,
adding that he has dogs of his own. “If they’ll lay
claim to them, I’ll pay for their dogs if they’ll pay
for my sheep.” '

 

 




 

 

MEMPHIS COMERCIAL APPEAL - March 29, 1988

Animal poisoning illegal

Laws designed
to protect wildlife

' By Tom Charlier
Staff Reporter

 

 

Federal law to the contrary, poisons remain a
popular weapon against animals that kill livestock
— and a constant threat to other, less harmful?
types of wildlife, according to state and federal of-
ficials.

“In every case where poison is put out, I can pret-
ty well guarantee you that wildlife dies,” said Gary
Cook, assistant regional manager for the Tennes-
see Wildlife Resources Agency.

A half-dozen dogs were found dead on private
property near Shelby Forest, north of Memphis,
over the weekend. Nearby residents claim the
dogs were poisoned. The owner of the property, W.
8. ‘Babe’ Howard, does not acknowledge using poi-
son, but admits to shooting dogs that threaten his
goats and sheep.

Cook said there was a similar case earlier this
year in Stewart County, west of Clarksville. There,
a property owner allegedly laced a dead calf with
poison, resulting in the deaths of several dogs, he
said. '

“Very seldom, you will get landowners who say,
‘Yes, I did that,’ ” said Cook, who believes there’s
. been an increase in poison use in recent years.

, Because of the threat to wildlife, the use of
g strychnine and similar poisons to control pred-
" ators in the Southeast is prohibited by federal law.
That law, governing the sale and use of pesticides
and other dangerous chemicals, takes precedence

over a state law allowing landowners to put out
poison on their property.

However, Cook and other officials said that with .
the increase in coyote populations across the state, ;
landowners have been quick to use poisons to pro- 3
tect calves, goats and sheep.

Jean Sullivan, executive director of the Mem-
phis Humane Society, said she often receives calls
from area residents who believe their animals
have been poisoned. j

But without eyewitnesses, or costly tests that ‘
would have to be performed, it is impossible to ,
verify the claims, she said. .

He said the poisons are restricted because they 5
could kill rare or endangered wildlife. Other types '6
of animals often die after eating a predator killed
by poison, he said. g

Defending their bear's care
Over the years, the Tylers have

' become very defensive of their

occupation because of criticism
from animal-rights groups. Last

bears broke a wreStler’s leg, and
this year in Bossier City, pro-
testers stopped the show from

The federal government failed
0 consider a significant loss of
:atch when it required shrimpers
“.0 use a controversial device to
protect sea turtles, a state attor-
ney said Wednesday.

“Our position is that they (fed-
eral authorities) are required to
consider the impact on fisher-
men,” Assistant Attorney Gen-
eral John Sheppard told the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of "Appeals.

The state is_challenging the
regulation requiringshrimpe‘rs to ‘
rig their nets with turtle 'excluder
devices, or TEDs, which are
designed to allow turtles to
escape when they are accidentally
netted.

PSheppard said“ one study

showed at least 4 percent of the
shrimp catch was lost through
use of TEDs.

“To shrimpers who pull the
nets, 4 percent is signiﬁcant,” he
said.

But Vicki Plaut'of the Justice
Department, representing the
U.S. Commerce Department, said
the loss is so small, it is “not
statistically signiﬁcant.”

Plaut said the “evidence is
more than adequate to justify
use” of TEDs to prevent the
drowning of rare sea turtles pro-
tected by the Endangered Species

Act. .

TEDs allow about 97 percent
of snagged turtles to escape,
Plaut said.

Sheppard said shrimp nets
have little effect on turtle popula-
tions.

David Hayes, an attorney for
the Center for Environmental
Education, said it is clear that
certain turtles are endangered
and “they are found in areas used
by shrimp trawlers and-are in fact
caught and killed” by shrimpers.

Hayes said the 5th Circuit
should uphold the TED regula—
tions as quickly as possible
because the shrimping season is
in full swing, putting turtles at
risk. -

The appeals judges, Eugene
Davis of Lafayette and Thomas
Gee and Jerry Smith, both of
Texas, didn’t indicate when-they
will rule.

The state ﬁled suit last Octo-
ber to stop the TED regulation
from going into effect March 1.

Shrimpers immediately backed
the suit, saying the metal devices

fill their nets with debris and
mud, force costly delays and
allow too many shrimp to escape.

U.S. District Judge Patrick E.
Carr ruled in February against
the state and the Louisiana Con-
cerned Shrimpers Association,
declaring shrimpers would have
to install the devices or face fines.

But the shrimpers were suc-
cessful in asking Carr to delay the
regulation from taking effect
until the 5th Circuit rules on
their appeal.

All offshore boats longer than
25- feet must use the devices from
March through November.

Shrimpers in inshore waters
and offshore shrimpers with
boats less than 25 feet won’t be
required to use TEDs if they
limit their trawls to 90 minutes.

mission. “The industry should
' carry a little of the cost.

“We’re not trying to make the
program self-sufficient, but we
have to have some money coming
in or it’s not an honorable situa-
tion,” he said.

Misso said the-$2-a-tag fee
would bring in about $50,000, less‘
than a, fourth of the $236,000
spent each year on alligator pro-

‘ ‘ grams, and about one-tenth the '

amount spent when staff salaries

All seven commissioners said.
the new fee should have been
included in proposals sent earlier,
rather than being brought up for

Misso said details were set

, ment, with a minimum of 25 per-

cent.

The affected areas are the
Pearl River, Joyce, ,Manchac,

National Wildlife Refuge. Air-
boats will be required in the
Atchafalaya refuge.

regulations, including the $2-a-

abstention. ..

The 1988 special alligator sea-
son runs Sept. 10 through Oct.
10, later than usual because cool

weather kept females from laying -

their eggs as early as usual.

Johnny Tarver, chief of the
Fur and Refuge Division, said he
expects about 25,000 tags to be
issued this year, though the exact
number will be decided after an
aerial survey of the alligator nests
is ﬁnished.

Last year, he said, hunters har- ~

vested about 23,000 alligators,
filling about 95 percent of the
tags issued. The skins brought an
average of $38 a foot.

“It appears the price will be
good again this year,” Tarver
said. Hides recently sold for $48 a
foot in Florida, he said. .

to help a California woman get

“I just want to ge 1m home,

She said she called Alton

cle about Sawyer’s captivity and
death.

Mrs. Alexander said she hoped
the other women might be able to
give her ideas or insights on how
to obtain her husband’s release.

“She called us . . . 'and told us
about her husband,” Milam said.

 

“She knew about Dad, and :

Mrs. Alexander said her hus-

At one point, two of these-emi—

Grundy pointed out that three—
quarters of the saturated fats in
chocolate consist of stearic acid,
a type of saturated fat that does
not raise cholesterol. Only a
quarter of the fats contain the
cholesterol—raising palmitic acid,
he said.

“So chocolate could be part of

Public stilt confused

The argument over a food item
commonly associated with the
national epidemic of obesity and
heart disease clearly demon-
strates why the public remains
confused about how to lower cho—
lesterol.

‘If we treated nutrition the way we treat
bypass surgery, we would at least have a

fighting start.’

Dr. William Castelli, Framingham Heart Study

Although their views on choco—
late seem diametrically opposed.
they really represent two impor~
tant messages about cholesterol
that can be reconciled.

Grundy’s message is that
Americans can eat a variety of
foods they enjoy - including
lean meat, olive oil, low-fat

W
cheeses and even chocolate ~—
and still comply with dietary
guidelines for lowering choles—
terol and preventing heart dis-
ease.

This will improve compliance,
since most Americans need not
face the bleak prospect of cutting
out all fat-containing foods that
they consider tasty, Grundy said.

On the other hand, Castelli’s
message is that 550,000 Amerié
cans die every year from heart
attacks because they and their
doctors haven’t yet grasped the
need to drastically reduce choles-
terol and saturated fats in the
diet.

Using the American Heart
Association’s Step 1 diet alone,
more than half of Americans
with borderline high cholesterol
between 200 and 239 milligrams
per deciliter could reduce it to the
desirable level below 200, Castelli
said. That diet involves limiting
fats to 30 percent of calories, in-
cluding less than 10 percent from
saturated fats, and consuming

 

fewer than 300 milligrams of cho-
lesterol a day.

Doctors, patients in dark

And Americans could stop the
progression of heart disease and
even reverse" it if they—triok fur-
ther steps to reduce cholesterol
levels to between 150 and 180,
Castelli said.

The major stumbling block, he
said, is an education gap.

 

M331; doctors don’t know
enough about nutrition and don’t
have time to teach patients how
to read food labels, Castelli said.

The majority of coronary by-
pass surgery patientsstiil aren’t
being put on strict diets, even
though they risk. “another :heart
attack or needingrepeat surgery
within 10 years, he said. '

And most household cooks are
too tired at the’endlof a working
day to try new low-fat recipes, he
said.

“We haven’t spent enough
money in this country on nutri-
tion.-lf we treated nutrition the
way we treat bypass surgery, we ,
would at least have a fighting
start,” Castelli said.

Know your choiesteroi

In lively discussions and inter-

views during the American Medi-
cal Association conference,
experts from Finland, Texas,
Boston and the National Insti-
tutes of Health made these key
points about cholesterol:
3» About 40 million American
adults have cholesterol levels of
240 or higher, putting them at
high risk for heart disease. But
less than half of Americans have
ever had their cholesterol
checked, and less than 10 percent .
know their number. Less than a :
quarter of Americans have
attempted diet changes to lower
their cholesterol.

The National Cholesterol Edu-
cation Program recommends that
all adults know their cholesterol
level. Diet and possibly drug
treatment are recommended for
levels of 240 or higher, or 200 to
21‘?) if the person has heart dis-
ease or two or more risk factors,
such as being male and smoking.
r» One-quarter of American chi.L
dren have abnormally high cho~
lesterol levels, which means
above 170 for children ages 3 to

16. Most of them will reach levizvis
of 240 or higher by middle age.

“It’s important to teach chilT‘
dren proper eating habits early in
life. The way we change how
Americans eat is to change the
way our children learn to eat,”
said Dr. Peter Kwiterovich Jr.,
professor of pediatrics at Johns
Hopkins Medical School mu-
1116175."

Parents and elementary
schools should teach children to
choose low-fat foods when they
are 6 to 10 years old because it’s
too late to change their eating
habits in high school, Kwitero-
vich said.

i» A recent Gallup survey found

 

that while most teen—agers want;
a healthy diet, only 47 percent
said they try to avoid high-cho-
lesterol foods.

Most teens are confused about

 

what foods are high in fats and
cholesterol. Onl 51 ei'cent

third stay away frombuttef, eggs,

’ P Substituting polyunsaturated
fats, which lower cholesterol, for
all other fats may increase risks

Grundy said it may be advisa-
ble to incorporate monounsatu—
rated fats in the diet because
they effectively lower cholesterol,
without potential risks. Good
sources of monounsaturates are
olive oil, peanut oil and canola
oil, a cooking oil marketed under
the name Puritan by Procter &
Gamble, he said.

SUNDAY, JULY 3, 1988 ' THE TlMES-PICAYUNE

 

Senators’ clout revives _

WASHINGTON —— The

National Institutes of Health,
yielding to congressional
- pressure, has reversed its decision
and will continue its $22 million
program to develop an artiﬁcial
'human heart.
4 The turnaround of a May
‘announcement was confirmed
Saturday by Dr. James B. Wyn-
gaarden, director of the agency,
who refused to comment on the
reasons.

But a top legislative aide to
Edward Kennedy, who is chair-
man of the Senate committee
that oversees NIH programs, said

 

the Massachusetts Democrat and
Orrin Hatch of Utah, who is the
ranking Republican on the panel,
pushed to continue the artiﬁcial
heart program.

The program’s goal is to
deveIOp a new, electrically
powered pumping device that
would be implanted in the body
to replace the total natural heart.

Such a device would be a major
advance over current artificial
hearts, which require bulky exter-
nal power sources to drive a
mechanical pump by compressed
air inside the body. The machines
have caused infections and blood
clots in patients.

All ﬁve patients who received

 

would help one ventricle of a dis-
eased heart pump blood but
would not replace the entire
heart.

Heart institute officials said
the partial device was‘further
advanced and could be tested in
humans within three years,
whereas the total artiﬁcial heart
would not be ready for clinical
testing for 10 to 15 years, if ever.

Last week, however, top

agency ofﬁcials decided to rein-
state the program. One key ofﬁ-
cial, who requested anonymity,
said they had no choice but to
retreat after Kennedy and Hatch
threatened to introduce legisla-
tion that would have blocked new

 

NIH programs until all long—term
commitments to previous pro-
grams, including the artificial

heart program, had been largely .

honored.

Kennedy is chairman of the
Senate Committee on Labor and
Human Resources, which autho-
rizes maximum financing levels
for agency programs. Hatch is the
ranking Republican on the com-
mittee. Both senatqrs have con—
tractors in their states who were
receiving money for the develop—
ment of an artiﬁcial heart. .

Dr. Mona Safarty, a health pol—
icy analyst for Kennedy’s com-
mittee, conﬁrmed that Kennedy,
at Hatch’s request, had consid-

 

__ artiﬁcial heart research

the most commonly used
mechanical heart, the J arvik 7,
have died within two years. The
device was designed by Dr.
Robert Jarvik in the early 19705
while he was a medical student at
the University of Utah.

Citing technical problems and
budgetary constraints, the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute, a component of the
National Institutes of Health,
announced in May that it would
terminate the quest for a total
artiﬁcial heart and would concen—
trate instead on developing a par-
tial artiﬁcial heart.

In the partial artificial heart,

the left-ventricular assist device

 

ered a legislative proposal that
would have required NIH to con-
tinue financing existing pro-
grams, such as the artiﬁcial heart
program, preferentially before

' awarding new grants and con-

tracts. That proposal has been
dropped‘now that NIH has

' reversed itself, she said.

The decision to terminate the
program, to which the govern-
ment had contributed nearly $240
million since 1964, had generated
considerable controversy. Some
health experts and policy ana-
lysts cheered the decision on the
ground that because the artiﬁcial
heart would benefit relatively few
patients at a very high cost.

 




 

Woman in the Mists
Farley Mowat
Warner Books, $19.95

As controversial, outspoken and promi-
nent defenders of wildlife, Canadian

never came to love. She showered her
love on horses as a child, and on crip-
pled children as a young woman work-
ing as a hospital physical therapist. In
her youth F os‘sey had dreamed of going
to Africa but was into her 305 before she
actually went there. It was then that she
resolved to work among the gorillas.
While Mowat provides little insight
into Fossey’s development and the ef-

wild gorilla has ever come so close to
‘holding hands’ with a human being.”
Fossey’s death remains clouded. With
her confrontational approach, likened
by many to the bluff charges of the
dominant male gorilla, Fossey had
alienated so many of her students and
Rwandan hosts that the list of suspects
with motives reads like an Agatha Chris-
tie novel. An American student was

author Farley Mowat and recently mur-
dered American primatologist Dian
Fossey were cut from the same irregular
cloth. So Mowat was a sound choice to

charged in absentia by the Rwandan
government, as was a gorilla tracker
who, until a few months previously,

fect upon her of her father’s suicide
while she was in Africa, her mistrust of
authority, affection for the victimized,

write a popular biography of the much-

maligned and equally revered Fossey.

In two decades of passionate, pio-
neering research into gorillas, Fossey led

a daunting and combative life.

There was much in that time for
which she could be fairly criticized. She
treated her hosts as inferiors, calling

them wogs. In her own ever—more-
obsessive battle against poachers she at-
tempted to scare them away from the
rare and highly endangered mountain
gorillas on the two-mile-high slopes of
Rwanda’s volcanoes. She resorted to
voodoo imprecations and when those
failed, to roping and whipping poach-
ers and burning their possessions.

Yet, as Mowat’s unabashedly sym-
‘ pathetic portrait makes abundantly
clear, such zealous vigilantism was
grounded in the anguish Fossey herself
had suffered in youth and adulthood
and that she’d seen perpetrated against
her beloved gorillas. Several were bru-
tally killed by poachers, and the death
of one particularly curious adolescent
male, Digit, led to the founding of Fos-
sey’s organization, the Digit Fund.

Through a unique agreement with
the fund and Fossey’s mother and step-
father, Mowat and his research associ-
ate, Wade Rowland, enjoyed access to
voluminous correspondence.

Mowat makes liberal use of Fossey’s
words, often set off in bold print,i’lend-
ing her own distinct voice to a remark-
able series of midlife adventures. She
emerges as mercurial, lusty, unstint-
ingly generous to her devoted friends,
venomous to her many enemies and
rough speaking to all.

Fossey’s parents divorced while she
was young. She was raised in cold com~
fort by her mother and a stepfather she

 

and stalwart independence clearly have
their origins in her early years. Nor does
he deal with the substance and initial
purpose of her African sojourn, study-
ing the ecology and behavior of the
mountain gorilla. At times his writing is
as breathless and disjointed as Fossey’s
own. There are lapses of scholarship—
Geza Teleki is a good-humored man
but he may not appreciate being called
“another leading woman primatologist.”
And sentences occasionally collapse un—
der the weight of clichés: “Under such
sybaritic conditions, Dian succumbed to
the romance of star-ﬁlled nights on the
sweet-smelling savanna.”

Mowat does devote considerable atten-
tion to Fossey’s woefully declining health
and tormented interpersonal relation-

ships over two decades in Africa. Torn '

between her commitment to her work
and her desire for husband and family,
Fossey endured many on-again, off-
again affairs, and brief, disappointing
liaisons, including one with Dr. Leakey,
in her vain search for companionship.

True to her conflicted nature, Fossey
lived like a pauper, yet impulsively gave
away money to friends in need. She
suffered acrophobia, broken limbs, em-
physema and a host of other, often life-
threatening, afflictions. Fossey endured
all these and continued to smoke, drink
and consume junk food.

But as? Mowat makes poignantly
clear, Fossey went to the gorillas for
sustenance in crisis after crisis. By the
end she was crawling, pitching over in
the mud, asleep from exhaustion, in her
now-infrequent climbs up Karisoke to
see the beasts.

Of one male gorilla’s approach to her
she wrote: “I slowly turned my hand
over and let it rest on the foliage. Pea-
nuts seemed to ponder accepting my
hand. . . . Finally he came a step closer
and, extending his own hand, gently
touched his ﬁngers to mine. To the best
of my knowledge this is the ﬁrst time a

had worked for Fossey. He hanged him-
self before the trial.

Mowat speculates that “influential
people” who increasingly viewed Dian
as an “impediment to the exploitation
of the Park National des Volcans, and
especially to the exploitation of the
gorillas” hired or ”su borned” an African
with whom she was familiar to kill her.

Yet, as Mowat points out, his interest
was in Fossey’s life, not her death. Oth-
ers will no doubt write a less-biased as‘
sessment of Fossey’s contributions to
conservation and science. Meanwhile,
Farley Mowat has produced an account
as contradictory, conflicted and fascinat-
ing as the woman herself.

_' ‘ Jean Lafitte National Park
ofﬁcials are withholding infor-

trapping in the park, and some
members of a citizens advisory
commission are angry. ,

Cause of a lawsuit ﬁled by local
environmental groups, to which
two commission members belong.

But Barry Kohl, a commission
member and a member of the
Orleans Audubon Society, one of
the groups that ﬁled the suit, has
Said the Park Service has no
right to withhold the infor-
mation. ' '

Until the suit was ﬁled in fed-
eral court in December, the Delta
Wilderness Preservatio‘n Com-
mission — the citizens’ advisory
committee — was frequently
given information on the num-
bers of animals killed by trappers
and hunters in the 9,000-acre
Barataria nature preserve south

Most of the park is off limits

Since then, the commissioners

earned was sent to US. Sen. J.

“The information should be

draft plan for regulating hunting
and trapping and the latest infor-
mation on the number of animals
in the park, he said.

National Parks Director Wil-
liam Penn Mott Jr. told
Johnston in a March 31 letter
that the draft plan would be
available for public review by
May 1988, and public meetings
would then be held‘to discuss it.

Based on ﬁgures provided in
the past and the information sent
to Johnston, Kohl said nearly
10,000 animals were trapped
from 1981 through 1987. About
9,000 were nutria. Others in-
cluded muskrats, raccoons, minks
and otters.

The Orleans Audubon Society,
the Fund for Animals and, now,
the Delta Chapter of the Sierra
Club are suing the Park Service
for allowing trapping without
ﬁrst having studied the animal
population and determined if
there should be limits on the
number trapped.

Meanwhile, park Superinten-

ney’s ofﬁce not to give the com-
mission information concerning

is decided, because of the afﬁlia~

and the environmental groups.

She said the draft hunting and
trapping management plan was
submitted to the Park Service’s
regional office in New Mexico,
and it was the regional ofﬁce’s
decision to postpone the review
of the plan until after animal
population studies are completed

Docktor Pet Shop: I recently
purchased a puppy from Docktor
Pet Shop in the Plaza at Lake

Forest. The puppy was diagnosed i

a day later by my veterinarian as
having an advanced case of sar-
coptic mange and a form of bro-
chitis. After four days I returned
the puppy to the pet store.

They offered to give me a store
credit toward another dog. How-
ever, since the puppy I purchased
had two diseases, I asked for a re-
fund and a reimbursement for
the vet bill since the puppy was
sick when I brought it.

The pet store has sent me a re—
fund, but I have not received a
check for the vet bill, which was
$53.90. I feel that I should receive
a refund for the medical treat—
ment.

—— E.S.H.

I queried Docktor Pet Store
and received a reply from Re-
becca Perrenot, executive assis-
tant for the Florida—based
Provident C0rp., its parent com-
pany. '

Perrenot says you were told at
the time of the sale that if you

health of the puppy, you could
take it to the store’s veterinarian
for a free check-up.

However, if medication was
needed, you would have to pay
for it.

You decided to take the puppy
to your vet instead.

Perrenot says that if you had
notified the pet store immedi—
ately, the puppy would have
been treated by the store’s vet at
no charge. However, you decided
to let your own vet treat it.

In addition, Perrenot says the
receipt that you signed states
clearly that the store does not
pay vet bills.

Now it’s my turn.

I don’t blame you for wanting
to take the puppy to your own
vet, someone you trust and
whose opinion you value. This
was a wise consumer move.

But the store is under no obli-

gation to pay the vet bills. You
were given reasonable options.

liéuisiana SPCA and
I: .2

TI”! Y ,iﬂ’gﬂw/‘jg New Orleans
in Dolores Nenos’ letter Oct.
28fg'about the Silver Springs mon-
keys a considerable portion of the
accusations were not only incor-

reﬁt, but misleading as well.

At the request of Gov.
EdWards, an inquiry was con-
ducted by the Louisiana SPCA
involving an international prima-
tologist with special expertise in
neurological damage. This person
participated in the original exam-
ination of these injured primates.

From the inquiry conducted by
the Louisiana SPCA, a public
document was generated, and
quite contrary to Ms. Nenos’
implication, the recommendation
did'not involve transfer of these
animals to Primarily Primates,
but in fact recommended eutha-
nasia for some of the non-control
animals.

The control animals, with the
exception of one, have been sent
to the San Diego Zoo, where re-
socialization is currently under
way. The remaining control ani-
mal is being re—socialized at the
Delta Primate Facility.

Ms. Nenos’ claim that the ani-
mals are being abused is unwar—

N

ranted. But the obvious choice
for those animals in pain is eu-
thanasia, since any attempt at
non-control animal re-social-
ization would undoubtedly result
in painful death to the animals.
To postpone this decision any
longer appears to me to be inhu-
mane.

Ms. Nenos pointed out that
Dr. Buyukmihci has been refused
access to the animals for exami-
nation. Dr. Buyukmihci’s exper-
tise lies outside of the area of
neurological evaluation of pri-
mates and, in fact, he has docu-
mented only one peer—reviewed
publication involving any pri-
mate. That publication involved
a study of the prevalence of eye
disease in a colony.

It is therefore obvious that Dr.
Buyukmihci is not qualified to
conduct an appropriate neurolog-
ical evaluation of primates since
his speciality is veterinary
ophthalmology.

Self-appointed organizations
such as these with which Ms.
Nenos has chosen to align herself
are also associated with various
national organizations such as
People For The Ethical Treat~
ment Of Animals (PETA). PETA
continues to serve as a spokes-

 

 

primate welfare case

group for other organizations
that take credit for break-ins and
damage to research facilities.

One of the most recent inci-
dents involved stealing cats
infected with toxoplasomosis.
Toxoplasomosis is extremely
dangerous to pregnant women,
and therefore the general popula—
tion has been put at risk by this
action.

It is also of concern to me that
large amounts of money are being
collected under the guise of ani-
mal welfare issues that go far be-
yond topics normally associated
with SPCA’S activities such as
adoption, neutering and spaying,
immunizations, etc. Therefore, it
appears to me that citizens in
good faith are donating funds to
promote activities without know-

ing exactly how these funds are

to be used.

It should be obvious that the
allegations made by Ms. Nenos
are not supported by the legally
authorized Louisiana SPCA, nor
do they reflect the attitude of the
current president.

son” which, according to the
Adcock opinion, is practicing vet—
erinary medicine without a li-
cense.

That’s a pretty silly opinion,
even for a lawyer. The SPCA,
lacking a corporeal existence, is

neither eligible to apply for a li-
cense nor capable of diagnosing
and treating animals. The SPCA
does not practice veterinary med-
icine; it is a corporation that em-

ploys doctors to do so. T

The law the SPCA Vets are ac-
cused of violating was obviously
not designed to outlaw an afﬁliae
tion with humane societies. The
law against a professional associ-
ation with people practicing
unlawfully was clearly intended
to prohibit vets from teaming up
with quacks or rogues.

Such an association is one of
14 offenses spelled out in the
statute for which vets can have
their licenses yanked by the state
board. Grounds for revocation in-
clude fraud, insanity, habitual
drunkenness, cruelty to animals
and moral turpitude. Are we
really to believe that, when legis-
lators drew up this list, they had
it in mind to stop vets from
working in an SPCA clinic?

The veterinary association’s
objective is not, of course. to rid
the profession of unsavory char»
acters but to ensure that doctors
in private practice get all the fees
going.

“We are not cold-hearted, but
we are business people,” associa-
tion secretary, Dr. Walter Ernst.
says. “The SPCA is a tax—
exempt, non-proﬁt organization
operating a full-service clinic in
direct competition with our
members.”

This is net the first time the
veterinary association has
crossed swords with the SPCA.
Earlier this year, the association
initially opposed an SPCA-Spoil"
sored bill in the Legislature that
would have imposed a tax on pet
food to raise money for humane
societies. The association with-
drew its opposition following
assurances that the money would
not be used to establish clinics all
over the state, but the bill died
anyway.

The Japonica Street clinic,
which takes in about $500,000 a
year, does spay and neuter ani-
mals at cut-price rates and its
vets treat sick animals more

cheaply than the private sector if

#301049.

the owners cannot afford to pay
the full price. Veterinary associa~
tion members can, therefore, be
said to suffer a certain economic
loss because of the SPCA.
although how significant it might
be is impossible to say.

Ernst says that his association
would not have objected had the
SPCA restricted itself to spaying
and neutering. However, the
charge against the SPCA doctors,
if upheld, would obviously put a
stop to the clinic’s efforts to
tackle the severe problem of ani-
mal overpopulation along with all
the. other veterinary services pro-
vided at Japonica Street.

Association members would be
prepared to spay and neuter ani-
mals cheaply, Ernst says,
although it is reasonable to sup-
pose that the closure of J apomca
Street would result in the breed—
ing of even more animals to be
abandoned, rounded up and put
to death. .

Ernst also says he does not
know of any provision that could
be made for the less affluent
owners who currentlytake sick
animals to Japonica Street.

You don’t see too many vets
wondering where their next
square meal is coming from in
these parts, and whatever eco—
nomic loss they suffer at the
hands of the SPCA can hardly be
enough to warrant putting the
SPCA out of business.

If the state board should rule
in favor of the veterinary associa-
tion, the SPCA will appeal to the
courts.

Bands of bold coyotes
plague livestock, jet ,

 

By The Associated Press

 

OMAHA, Neb. — The elusive
coyote has become a bold menace
in southeastern Nebraska, where
a pack 0 e aﬁ'nTa‘ls is blamed
for mauling horses and another
coyote caused a commercial jet to
abort its takeoff.

A federal coyote expert said
he’s not sure why the coyote, a
cousin of dogs and wolves, has
become so brave.

“It’s unusual because thev are
a shy and secretive animal. That
. doesn’t mean they are not there,”
' said Tom Nicholls, assistant re-
. giﬂalmector of theaU.S.
' Department of Agriculture’s ani—
. mardamage control program.
. “Whiﬁi you do start seeing—them,
it means they are braver for some
reason. Maybe hunger forced
them out or there’s a large pop-
ulation.”

"i The coyote weighs an average
of 30 pounds and resembles a dog
but with a more pointed nose and
ears. As with any wild animal,
.the coyote could attack humans
if sick or trapped, Nicholls said.
3 A coyote ran onto a runway at
‘Lincoln Munici al Airport Nov.
, 24 as a Boeing 737 jet was begin-

.ning its taxi to take-off, said

 

'Wayne Andersen. the Lincoln
Airport Authority director.

“The coyote ran across the
runway as an opossum would run
across the road and ended up
under the aircraft’s front
wheels,” Andersen said. “"he
pilot stopped and inspected the
wheels and tires. The. plane was
cleared mechanically and went
ahead.

“I can’t remember in recent
years a plane hitting any animal
on the runway,” e said.

At the Sons of Val Horse Farm
in Waterloo outsideOmaha,
thTée coyotes mauled a thorough—
bred horse valued at $80,000. The
horse had to be destroyed.

Theresa S son, who works at

the ﬁanother horse, a
yearling, had to be destroyed
about 10 days later after it broke
its back in an attack, probably by
coyotes.
. Both attacks occurred about a
month ago. The coyotes appar-
ently forced the ﬁrst horse into a
fence and mauled it, Samson
said. The horse lost a leg and an
eye, had cuts all over its upper
body and the body was swollen
with blood, she said.

To stave off more attacks,
ranch hands began going out at

night to scare the coyotes away,
she said.

“They saw the coyotes and
shot at them and now the coyotes
haven’t come around,” she said. *
“I think they have moved off.”

“Like any predator, the coyote
is an opportunist," Nicholls said.
“It feeds on whatever is most
readily available: carrion, live»-
stock, grasshoppers, watermelon .
or wild plums.” ’

The coyote deserves its car-
toon reputation as a wily crea»
ture, Nicholls said. “They learn
very quickly and adapt to our
ways,” he said.

Many western Nebraska

Wildlife biologist Randy Stu—

rafts Commission saith is hard
to tell if coyotes are increasing in
eastern Nebraska. The animal’s
bolder movements could be
caused by many factors, he said.

Diabetes patients in remission

Nowhouoo News Service

 

WASHINGTON A drug
used to pr ventthewrejection of
transplante organs can put a
signiﬁcant number of newly diag-
nosed insulin-dependent diabet—
ics into remission, researchers
from several countries say.

At the end of one year of treat-
ment, betweent25 percent and 33
percent of pati ts were in renTi's-
sion, meaning they had normal
[blood sugar levels and did not re-
quire insulin injections. In pa-
.tients caught extremely early, the
remission rate was as high as 70
percent.

 

But in almost all cases, the dia-
betes returned permanently
within a few months after the
treatment was stopped, indicat-
ing that an effective therapy
would require life-long use of cy-
closporine.

“We have not solved the prob-
lem; we have opened a new possi-
bility of therapy,” said Dr. Jean-

Francgis Each of r es
Umyemms. “The poten-

tial is enormous.”

Use of c clos orine in diabetics
remains experimental, and will be
so for some time, several re-
searchers said. It is useful only in
the early stages of insulin-depen-
dent diabetes, when the body can
still produce the hormone.

Bach noted cyclosporine can
cause serious side effects, and the
long-term safety of the drug is
unknown. Nor is it known yet
whether cyclosporine can reduce
the serious complications of dia-
betes that include blindness, gan-
grene, kidney failure, strokes and
heart attacks.

“We have shown it is abso-
lutely effective in inducing a re-
mission; we know it is relatively
safe if we keep a close eye on the
dosage," said Dr. Calvin R. Stiller

of the I-Ini_v_e_1;sj_ty\of\Western

in WQL diabetics £79821
“Hopefully, ‘Cv'é‘WﬂFBe able-”to
come up with a regime that we
can test in a long—term beneﬁcial
study.”

Unless cyclosporine can pre-
vent severe complications, it
would be cheaper and safer to
stick with insulin, Stiller sug-
gested.

346 Use of cyclosporine, which in-

terferes with the immune sys-
tem’s abiTit to reject foreign
tissue, is credited With greatly in-
CTEaising the success rate of
human organ transplants.

Insulin-dependent diabetes
afflicts some 500,000 Americans,
mostly children and young adults,
according to the American Diabe-
tes Association. They are unable
to make insulin and must take
daily injections of the hormone
to survive.

 

In a major advance, research-
ers have shown in the past few
years that this form of diabetes is
an auto-immune disease, one in
which the body’s natural defenses
turn against its own cells. In this
case, it results because a part of
the immune system —-— cells
called T-lymphocytes —— attack
and destroy the insulin-secreting
beta cells in the pancreas.

“Our, attitude is that it really is
like a rejection, an auto—immune
rejection,” Stiller explained in an
interview.

Cyclosporine speciﬁcally tar-
gets T-cells, leaving other parts
of the immune system intact to
battle infections. Thus research-
ers sought to learn whether it
would work in early insulin-
dependent diabetes.

Results of tws)! uman
trials were reported recently at
an international scientific meet-
ing sponsored by Sagglgz Phar-

Finland, Denmark, West Ger-
many and Austria; half got the
drug and half got an inactive
placebo. ‘

> French researchers had previ- *
ously reported a 25 percent re-
mission in 150 adults after one
year. In a new study, involving 27
children ages 9 to 15, a similar re-
mission rate occurred.

b In both studies, people who
began cyclosporine treatments
less than two weeks after symp-
toms ﬁrst appeared had around a
70 percent remission rate.

Lasers may replace sutures
l. ../9.01‘0na£¥.193:12§§§§mg€ry

v.0 . L4.

By JON VAN
\ The Chicago Tribune

 

ANAHEIM, Calif. —-— Using
lasers instead of sutures may
improve greatly the success of
coronary bypass surgery, a San
Francisco vascular surgeon pre-
dicted last week.

Dr. John Crew of the San i

Francisco Heart Institute at
Seton Medical Center has used
lasers to weld wounds in arteries
in the arms of more than 15
patients so far and plans to use
the technique in at least 50
patients by the year’s end.

“This technique causes no
damage to tissue. It’s like gluing
the wound shut,” said Crew, who
reported on his work to the
annual meeting of the American
Heart Association.

After gaining experience with ’

arteries in the arm, Crew hopes
to use lasers for attaching new
arteries to the heart in coronary
bypass surgery.

The bypass procedure provides
a new path for blood ﬂow to the
heart muscle, rerouting it around

arteries clogged with plaque. One
problem with the current bypass
technique, Crew said, is that
sutures in the arteries leave scar
tissue and the scars can promote
thickening of artery walls, closing

‘This technique causes
no damage to tissue.
It’s like gluing the
wound shut.’

Dr. John Crew,
San Francisco Heart Institute

 

off the new blood supply path-
way.

“We’re looking for a technique
of scar-free surgery,” said Crew.

Crew’s work with low-power
argon lasers is apparently the
ﬁrst use of lasers in humans to
weld arteries. Most medical lasers
are used to heat or destroy tissue,
but not the technique Crew uses.

The temperature generated by
Crew’s argon laser is only 103
degrees Fahrenheit.

“This is just a little warmer
than normal body temperature.
It’s like a mild fever,” said Crew.

“There is a photochemical
reaction that causes bonding of
the tissue, but there is no melting
of tissue.”

Experimenters have been
workin on animals for years to
develop a laser welding tech-

nique, but most of these efforts

have centered upon lasers of

higher power that generate more
heat than the equipment used by
Crew.

“We are excited about this
technique because it seems to
produce an almost normal
artery.”

Arteries that have been
repaired with lasers retain their
original elasticity after about two
months of healing time, he said.

The technique may ﬁnd appli—
cations in repairing blood vessels
throughout the body, especially
arteries in the legs that may
become clogged with plaque,
Crew said.

“We hope that eventually this
technique will help surgeons
repair blood vessels in which
sutures have proven to be inade—
quate,” he said. “Thus laser weld-
ing may help surgeons save
hearts, legs and other parts of the
body that they couldn’t save
before.”

There may also be applications
for the technique with other tis-
sue. Experimental wor_lg has
alrgady begun imanimals‘to
reconnect the bowel in a scar-free
mam lasers, Crew said.

Using the laser requires great
care in setting up the patient for
surgery, Crew said, but the tech-
nique itself is fairly easy for an
experienced surgeon.

Animal-rights demonstrators

taunt holiday

By The Associated Press

 

NEW YORK — An estimated
700 animal-rights protesters Fri-
day taunted holiday shoppers in
furs outside some of Manhattan’s
biggest clothing stores.

“Try looking at the mirror in
the morning,” a protester yelled
at one woman on the biggest
shopping day of the year.

“We’re trying to get people to
think about the animal suf-
fering,” said Steve Siegel, New

York director of Trans-S ecies
Unlim'ted. a national animal-
rights organization that spon-
sored the third annual protest.

 

ICﬁ’YOA/é

Siegel said similar protests
were planned in 37 other cities
around the country to mark the
start of the holiday shopping sea-
son. Demonstrators carried pic-
tures of raccoons, seals and
minks on what they called Fur-
Free Friday. T

“With fur sales at an all—time
high, the animal rights move—

'ment is no longer prepared to

stand by and wring its hands hel-
plessly,” Siegel said, noting 2,500
retail furriers sell $2 billion worth
of furs in the United States a
year.

The protesters, chanting
“Don’t buy furs,” came across

shoppers in furs

hundreds of people wearing furs
on a day when temperatures fell
into the 303. '

“Shame, shame,” they shouted
at fur—wearers like Genevieve
Burlingame of Darien, Conn.,
who smiled despite boos, shouts
and protest signs waved in her
face.

“It’s terrible. I wish I had
avoided them,” she said, adding
she would continue to wear furs.
“I think it’s very nice to be able
to afford something better. It’s
the American way.”

synthetic fibers, proceeded past.

“It’s not like an endangered spe-

Some protesters said their
cause was boosted this year when
Bob Barker, emcee of the Miss
USA pageant, forced the contes-
tants to wear fake furs. by threat-
ening to walk out if they put on
real ones.

Friday’s demonstration was
not violent as had been feared by
the Fur Retailers Information
Council, which said in a release
that activists in the past had deli-
vered death threats to furriers
and ﬁrebombed fur stores in Eng—
land.

Du‘ckhunt lands
Houma exec

12’Lr?’7

 

By STEVE CANNIZARO
Staff writer

[KM 65— KIMYUUC

 

The vice president of a Houma
company was ordered in federal
court Tuesday to serve 30 days 1n
a halfway house and perform 208
hours of community service, and
was ﬁned $1, 500 for conducting a
duck hunt over an illegally baited
pond in December 1984.

Robert Dan Gray, 50, of OK
Fishing &»Rental Tool Inc.,
received the unusually stiff sen—
tence from [1.8. Magistrate
Michaelle P. Wynne, who said,
“The offense can’t be tolerated.”

Wynne also ﬁned'~the company
$2,500 for baiting ponds with sev-
eral hundred pounds of grain
near Trappers Canal in the
Houma area.

Prosecutor Peter Thomson
said that after baiting the ponds
to lure the ducks, Gray, a com-
pany salesman and guests of the
company took part in the duck
hunt

Gray pleaded guilty to baiting
the pond and killing 12 ducks
over the limit.

Wynne said she strongly con-
sidered jailing Gray but opted to
follow the request of Gray’s attor-
ney, Joseph McMahon, who had
said that a halfway house would
be more appropriate.

McMahon said Gray has oth-
erwise “been a law-abiding citi-
zen” whose company has sup-
ported charitable causes.

Wynne ordered Gray to report
to a halfway house in New
Orleans on Jan. 18.

Werlein J. “Moose” Prosperie,
52, of Houma, an employee of OK
Fishing, was fined. $1,000 and
ordered to perform 208 hours of
community service.

Prosperie killed four ducks
over the limit and was also
involved in baiting the pond,
according to Bill Mellor, a special
agent with, the US. Fish and
Wildlife Service.

The customers of the company
had been brought for the duck
hunt from Texas, New Mexico
and Louisiana, ofﬁcials said.

Killing of dogs
by ofﬁcer frets
‘Pied Piper’

‘Pack folloWing old Veteran
was shot down, clubbed

The Associated Press

" BLACKSHEAR, Ga. —— Elliott. Trueluck is a familiar
ﬁgure here, a disabled veteran who used to sing to a pack
of dogs that followed him on his daily walk to a coffee
shop. But he says he’s afraid to walk downtown since a
police ofﬁcer opened ﬁre on his followers.

“It scared the I-don’t-know-what out of me,’ said
Trueluck, 61. “I did what that boy (police ofﬁcer) told me
to do and got out of there. What if he had turned the gun
on me instead of the dogs?”

The shooting last Friday, which killed at least two dogs,
including one of Trueluck’s own, has angered residents
who watched the little band pass by each day for years.
Although defending the ofﬁcer, city ofﬁcials alsopromised
an investigation, and charges have been ﬁled by a judge.

“I’ve walked right by them on the sidewalk, and all they
did was wag their tails,” said Judy Thompson, who
witnessed the shooting. “It’s bad to think you live in a
town where the cops just pull up and go to shooting.”

Harriett Dixon, director of the Okefenokee Humane
Society in nearby Waycross, said police Sgt. James Mock
killed up to eight dogs. Some were killed by shotgun blasts,
while wounded dogs then were beaten to death with a billy
club, she said. _ .

Mock has refused to discuss the incident, but Mayor”
Harry Adams said the ofﬁcer shot. two dogs on orders from
City Hall. Adams said Trueluck had laughed off warnings
that the dogs’ presence violated the city leash law.

Warrants issued by a probate judge charged Mock with
cruelty to animals, and he is free on $500 bail. The judge
issued the warrants, which allege that at least four dogs
were injured or killed, after hearing statements from the
Humane Society and a witness.

Several residents of this community of 3,500 said the
dogs that followed Trueluck each morning posed no threat.

“We watched him every day,” Rebecca Jacobson said.
“He had different dogs with him every day. He’d walk, and
they would follow him. If one of them strayed, he’d sing.” f

Jacobson said she was working in a drugstore when she

“He ain’t been right since they shot the dogs," 'sne said.

A symptom of Elliott Trueluck‘s condition is that he
laughs at just about everything. During a recent mterv1ew,
he chortled constantly while recalling his fear during the
shooting. But he conﬁrmed that he had been warned.

Now that he has stopped walking to town, Trueluck
sometimes sits on the steps of his home, talking to Nobody,

a black Labrador retriever that escaped the gunﬁre.

LOS ANGELES TIMES; May 6, 1988
Only in L.A./

Contrary to whata lot of dogs (and
presumably their owners) think.
Laurel Canyon Park is not yet officially
open to off-the-leash play, say Los
Angeles city ofﬁcials.

Even though the City Council voted 11

the park during certain early—morning
and late-afternoon daylight hours on a
Six-month experimental basis, the
ordinance won’t become effective until
30 days after Mayor Tom Bradley signs it.

He’s out of town and hasn't signed it
yet, his ofﬁce says.

In the meantime, scores of dog owners
have driven in from miles around to give
their pets momentary freedom in a Santa
Monica Mountains park many of them
never heard of before reading about the
City Council action.

“Thanks a lot for printing that map,”
said an unhappy Jane Purse, head of Park

Blind woman credits her dog
with helping her get a degree

‘—
By KAREN BRANDON
Staff Writer

To hear Frances Vitulla talk, the journey toward
a diploma wasn’t so rough.

Never mind that she had to take notes in Braille
or “read” her books by listening to tapes.

Never mind that it took a long time to learn the
lay of the campus, at first by tapping a cane and
later with the help of a Seeing Eye dog named Ma-
VlS.

Vitulla, accompanied by Mavis, was one of an es-
timated 400 students who got diplomas Thursday
night at Broward Community College’s graduation
ceremonies, held in the Omni Auditorium on the
Coconut Creek campus.

Mavis, a black Labrador retriever, wore a mor-

tarboard in honor of the occasion.

“After all,” said Vitulla, who was born blind,
“she had to sit in classes, too.”

Vitulla, 36, spent five years working her way to
the associate’s degree in sociology, taking courses
part time.

David Vitulla, her husband of 11 years, and her
family have always encouraged her to be indepen-
dent, she said. But getting Mavis improved her
confidence, she said.

“She improved my mobility. I talk to her as I’m
walking along. People might lock you up if you
walked along talking to a cane,” she said.

Now she’ll give herself a break before she begins
looking for a job, perhaps something in the field of
counseling, she said. '

“I don’t think any of this was difficult, really,”
she said. “When you’re determined, you find a
way.”

In this rugged country in south-
eastern Indiana, Mr. Strasser, a

provides for the wildlife he con-

eagles and mountain lion.

Mr. Strasser’s 23-acre farm, set
high on a bluff above a winding
country road, has become a safe
harbor and place of convales-
cence for sick or injured wildlife
or other mistreated animals. For
more than 10 years, game war-
dens, environmentalists and
farmers here have known they
can deliver the wildlife victims of
man and his inventions to Mr.
Strasser. He will nurse them back
to health, and, when possible, re-
leaselthem into the wild once
again.

He tends to a pair of golden
eagles whose wings were crippled
by a hunter’s bullets; a barn owl
injured after becoming tangled in
barbed wire; a mountain lion that
had almost starved to death while
being kept as a pet; a great
horned owl, its lower paw de-
stroyed by a bullet.

Each day, Mr. Strasser or his
wife, Jane Ellen, cuts mice or
scraps of meat into tiny pieces for
the owl, who otherwise would be

unable to eat.

these poor things,” Mr. Strasser

Mr. Strasser, a bearded, burly

In fenced pens stretching for
acres across forested land, Mr.
Strasser keeps four gray wolves
and two hybrid red wolves, which

CHICAGO TRIBUNE - May 1, 1988

SOME MORE PROOF THAT PEOPLE HUNT BECAUSE THEY
LIKE TO KILL, AND BECAUSE IT BRINGS A LOT OF

MONEY INTO THE AREA.

Voice of the people

 

Save prairie chickens and our heritage

SPRINGFIELD—I would like to present a
different perspective on the future of the state’s
endangered prairie chicken population than that
presented in John Husar’s column “Woods and
waters” (April 17). '

A drastic decline in Illinois’ last native flock of
prairie chickens has been experienced over the
past IS years due largely to pheasant . _
encroachment on prairie chicken nesting Sites. Mr.
Husar suggested that such a small and declining
population should be forsaken in favor of the.
pheasants and game—hunting enthusrasts. I believe
we can provide for the existence of both
populations in Illinois. . .

Once wide-ranging across Illinois prairies and
numbering in the millions, the state’s prairie
chicken flock now resides only on scattered
patches of restored prairie and grassy meadows,
around 2,000 acres in Jasper and Manon
Counties—a scant habitat when compared to
Illinois’ 35.5 million acres devoted to corn and
soybeans, cities and suburbs, forests and wetlands.

Illinois is a very large state with a wrde divers1ty
of interests and natural resources. The interests of
hunting enthusiasts are no less important than
those of nonhunters or preservationists. I believe
that Illinois is big enough to provide the vast
habitat it does for a large pheasant population and
to support a thriving hunting industry, of which I
am an active participant. _

Within 50 miles of Jasper and Marion Counties

are prime pheasant hunting locations. as well as
Department of Conservation properties such as
Ramsey lake State Park, Washington County
Conservation Area, Carl le Wildlife Management
Area, Rend Lake Wildli e Management Area and
Richland County Conservation Area. Conversely,

the state also is big enough to afford a tiny habitat
for the preservation of an important symbol of
our prairie heritage. As we all know, there is little
of that original natural heritage left anywhere
today.

Giving up ‘the ﬁght to prevent theextinctien of
a single species representing our native Wildlife,
our natural heritage, sets a dangerous precedent
for the loss of countless species and the plant and
animal diversity that provides a solid grounding
for our own rich and secure exrstence.

Further, the dollars that have been expended
through the years to save this species have largely
been donated by concerned lllinorsans through the
Nature Conservancy and the Nongame Wildlife
Conservation Fund checkoff. Much of the money
used to purchase the 2,000—acre sanctuary was
donated by Illinois citizens who also are '
sportsmen. Thus, many individuals have given a
direct indication of their desire to preserve
endangered wildlife.

Other states also are battling to preserve their
prairie chicken populations. Missouri, Minnesota
and Wisconsin, like Illinois, have remnant
populations. They are actively managed by the
conservation agencies in those states even though
they are not hunted.

Finally, the drastic decline being experienced by
the prairie chicken now is a direct result of
pheasant competition in a relatively small area. A
cooperative effort by both hunters and nonhunters
alike can provide a place in the prairie state for
both wildlife populations.

Grants to fuel research

into deaths

FERNANDINA BEACH (AP) —-'
A money-starved project to study
mass dolphin deaths along the East
Coast has received a boost from the
Navy and the National Marine Fish-

, eries Service.

The Office of Naval Research
has handed over $50,000 for the dol-
phin study, and Tom McIntyre of
the fisheries service said his agency
soon will chip in another $50,000.

“The animals are still dying.
The Navy felt it was appropriate

'that the investigation continue.

They did a review of his proposal,
and it was accepted. We are in the
process of moving our money,” Mc-
Intyre said Friday.

The beneficiary is the task force
headed by a Canadian researcher,
Dr. Joseph Geraci, who has anxious-

ly awaited more money since the '

study’sfunding ran out earlier this
year.

Marine fisheries officials said
two months ago that because of
funding shortfalls no further re-
search was being done and the
study might be doomed.

Among the research are studies
on tissue from hundreds of dolphins
that perished along Florida’s coast
from Fernandina Beach to the Or-
mond Beach area, beginning on
Thanksgiving.

Geraci, professor of veterinary
medicine in the pathology depart-
ment at the University of Guelph
near Toronto, is a member of the

of dolphins

US. Marine Mammal CommiSsion.
. He was asked by the US. gov-
ernment to head the research pro-
ject that began in July when
hundreds of dead dolphins began
washing ashore in New Jersey and
Virginia. The deaths spread down
the coast, reaching Florida in No— .
vember.’ ‘ A

Fisheries service statistics put
the official dolphin death toll from
New Jersey to Florida at 742, but
the actual number is probably much
higher because mammals that
didn’t wash. ashore couldn’t be
counted.

“One thing we can be certain of
is that more animals died than we
counted," said fisheries service
spokesman Brian German. “How do
you count animals you can’t see?”

The cause of the deaths is un-
known, although scientists believe
something is sapping the dolphins’ .
immune systems, leaving them to
languish and die from a host of
common infections.

Members of the environmental
group Greenpeace said they believe
the possible long-term effects on
East Coast dolphin herds are omi-
nous. The fisheries service fears
that as much as 40 percent of the
area’s dolphin population has been
wiped'out.

“It could take decades to recov-
er,” said Lesley Scheele, a dolphin
project coordinator for Greenpeace.
“That’s drastic.”

Shelter offers birds for adoption

By MIKE MAHAN
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA — It’s not often Hillsborough County Ani-
mal Control shelter offers a bird for adoption, but this.
morning 75 may fly the coop for $5 apiece.

Lynn Tyler, director of animal control, has 71 para-
keets and four finches under his care that are ready to
ﬂee the barking dogs and yowling cats at the shelter for
the quiet of private homes.

Animal control’s unusual residents were seized
April 27 from F.W. Woolworth Co. Inc. at 2257 East
Gate Plaza. Thirteen parakeets taken from the store
died a day or two later.

The birds died from neglect and malnutrition, said
Lynn Goldie, deputy director of animal control.

Investigators from the department went to the store
after a shopper complained that the birds appeared to
be in poor condition. "

On Monday, Hillsborough County Court Judge Rob-
ert Bonanno awarded custody of the flock to animal
control. The case is still under investigation.

Store manager Mike Romanko, who was named in
the civil petition brought by animal control demanding
custody of the birds, refused comment on the case.

Dr. Catherine Deptula, an animal control veterinari-
an, said the birds were thin and sickly when they ar-
rived at the shelter. After two or three days with
adequate food and water, they recovered, she said.

Elephants whiSper
among themselves

By Carl Hartman
The Associated Press

WASHINGTON -— It seems that '

elephants can get by with whisper-

ing where most of us would have to:

shout.

Katherine Payne, an elephant
researcher in Etosha Park,
Namibia, says that elephants can
be heard for as far away as three
miles when they “talk. ”

But most of the time only other
. elephants can hear. Two—thirds of
the sounds they make are too low
for humans, just as a dog whistle
makes sounds too high for the
limited human ear, she says. .

“If you get close enough to the
elephant, though, you can feel,
them,” the Cornell University re-
searcher said recently at a news
conference hosted by her sponsor,
the World Wildlife Fund. "It’s like
thunder,_ sometimes, or being in
church close to the lowest pipe on
the organ.”

Pigeons and guinea fowl can
hear such "infra—sounds,” an Asian

grouse called the capercaillie is 7

known to make some, and ﬁn
whales make quite a lot, but
elephants seem to be the ﬁrst land
aninials found to have the talent.
"The existence of these calls
may "help explain how elephants

coordinate their society over long
distances,’ Payne wrote in a sum-

mary of her work.

She knows about a dozen diﬁ"er-’
ent sounds that elephants make,
such as the kind of greeting-_

chorused‘ by" a group of -‘=fé’males '

when a male has found them.
. "The males can tell one another
things like ‘That’s CarOline and

Arizona and is patterned after training sessions in
California.

“It gives both the dogs and the handlers an

opportunity to improve their skills in a variety of
situations,” said Sgt. Pendergast.

The program, which began Wednesday and con—

cludes today, involves classroom discussion as well as
real-life but posed police problems.

For example, dogs and their handlers Thursday

night confronted a dozen angry “pickets” at the
Arizona State Fairgrounds and forced them to clear
the area.

The pickets whistled and banged sticks and tossed

None of the dogs even flinched.

Wild birds _

Contaminated food
blamed for spread

By Yvonne Daley .
Special to the Globe

POULTNEY, Vt. — Wild songbirds
across a large section of the Northeast
have died in recent months from salmo-
nella poisoning from contaminated bird
food.

In several locations, veterinarians
have treated cats that have also been af—
fected after eating contaminated birds.
and officials Friday expressed concern
that the disease could spread to other
mammals. including squirrels and chip-
munks. ,

"If the disease gets into the breeding
species, and in particular those that we
have in large populations, like grackles
and black birds, we’ll never get rid of it. It
will spread from there to other mammals
through the food chain," Nancy Read, a
bird rehabilitator at the Vermont Insti—
tute of Natural Science, said.

For that reason, veterinarians, envi-
ronmentalists and the National Health
Research Center have called for a cessa—
tion in feeding wild birds for the remain-
der of the spring and summer throughout
New England and New York.

”At the least. people should empty
their bird feeders, disinfect them and stop
feeding for 10 days. It’s a good idea to stop
for the season,” said Dr. Ward Stone, a
wildlife pathologist for the New York De
partment of Environmental Conservation
in Delmar.

It was Stone who isolated the bacteria
affecting the birds after he was sent sam-
ples from birds that had died in Poultney.
Vt. The bacterium is salmonella typhi-
murirum, a prevalent bacteria in wildlife.

Scientists believe the disease is being
Spread through contaminated seed. The

BOSTON GLOBE - May 1, 1988

So far, at least nine species of birds
have been affected throughout the North-
east from southern Maine to upstate New
York, with concentrated reports of dead
birds, as many as a dozen at individual
feeders, in Hillsboro. N.H., Poultney and
Woodstock, Vt.. Hampton and Granville.
N.Y.. on the Vermont border, and in Co-
lumbia and Rensellaer counties, N.Y.. on
the Massachusetts border.

Dr. Thomas Raffe, veterinary medical
officer for the National Wildlife Health Re-
search Center in Madison, Wis., said
there have also/been scattered reports of
salmonella deaths in birds in central Wis-
consin and throughout/ the Adirondack
region. ‘

Pine siskins, tiny, sparrow—like song—
birds, have been hardest hit. Also affect-

. ed are black-capped chickadees, house

sparrows, evening grosbeaks, common
redpolls, American goldfinches, cardi-
nals, cowbirds and boat-tailed grackles.
The last two species were the most re-
cently affected and have caused concern
because both are aggressive birds that
usually have a cast-iron resistance to dis-
ease. according to veterinarian Scott Ma-
chachlan of Poultney, who has been re-
searching the problem since, winter.
macriachlan was one of the
first to suspect an epidemic after a
number of sick and dying birds
were brought to his office, fol-
;lowed by a number of very sick
mts. He sent samples from the
dead birds to Stone’s office for
identification. ;.;_
No one knows how many birds ,3.
have been affected because many
may die in the woods and few peo- ’
ple report dead birds to veterinar-
ians or other officials, the scien-
tists agreed.
The strain of salmonella killing
birds has not been known to af-
'fect humans, but it is theoretically
possible that infection could oc-
cur, Machachlan said. He said he
had received several calls from
people reporting symptoms typical
of salmonella poisoning that they
thought might have been caused
by handling sick birds or pets.
Symptoms in cats include high
fevers — as high as 104 degrees
compared with a normal 101 - di-
arrhea and loss of appetite. ’
In wild birds. the most com-
mon symptom is lethargy. The
birds tend to stay around the bird .

the Queen

By Geoffrey Lee Martin
in Melbourne

AN AUSTRALIAN Sheepdog
called Spud, which wears a
wristwatch “so he can tell
when it’s shearing time”, had
the Queen laughing
yesterday.

The Queen, on walkabout in
the port of Geelong about 40
miles south-west of Melbourne,
noticed the watch as Spud
mustered half a dozen sheep for a
shearing demonstration.

Intrigued, she walked over to
Spud’s owner, Peter Sharp, a
bearded, laconic 38-year-old
dressed in slouch hat and a bush-
man’s all-weather coat, known
locally as a “driza-bone”.

The Queen pointed at Spud’s
paw, laughed heartily and shook
her head in apparent disbelief as ,
she walked away.

Peter, who comes from a spot é
called “Bunjii Moolaghurk —

that’s back of Sutherland Creek,
. near Moorabool, past the black ‘

MEMPHIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL - May 2, 1988

Horse fanciers snort
at rules, reputation

 

By Clay Bailey
Staff Reporter

 

Trainers and owners of Ten-
nessee walking horses think
they’re getting kicked around by
government bureaucrats who
don’t know a racking horse from
a rocking horse.

“They didn’t hire the secre—
tary of agriculture because he
was a horse expert,” Ray Gilmer,
owner of Ray Gilmer Stables on
Collierville-Arlington Road,
said with more than a hint of an.
ger.

Recent changes in govern-
ment regulations threatened to
drive owners and trainers of
. Tennessee walkers out of busi-
ness. Some of the regulations
have been adjusted, however,
: and horse shows apparently will
go on, beginning with Friday’s
Collierville Classic.

But owners and trainers say
they still plan to fight new rules
they call unnecessary and im-
pressions of cruelty to their ani-
mals they believe are unfair.

“When someone who’s never
seen me and does not know me

says I’m cruel to an animal, I con-
sider it a personal affront, espe-
cially when I spend so much
time with my horses,” said Mag-
gie Evans, who raises horses
near Arlington. “When one of
them gets a runny nose, I call the
vet,,’ . .

Gilmer concurred. “I’ve been
in the horse business for 22
years, and all I’ve done is defend
this horse. And he doesn’t need

defending. It’s time we said

we’re not doing anything wrong,

and let someone else back up.”
He added: “I don’t feel like the

real story has been told.'The ma-

’ jority of people have taken the

bad points and blown them out
of proportion.”

Last month, Secretary of Agri-
culture Richard Lyng banned as
harmful four-inch pads and 10-
ounce chains used on walkers’
legs to produce a high-kick gait.
Walking horse shows were can-
celed and the multimillion-dol-
lar industry was in an uproar.

A few weeks later, however, he
rescinded the ban and ordered
the pads and chains to be phased
out during the next several
months.

. trainers

 

Controversial pads and a chain are wrapped around the legs of a
Tennessee walking horse. Riggings like these are being phased
out after a ruling from Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng.

Bill Barnett, owner of Wind-
song Farms in southeast Shelby
County, said the changes and re-
visions were unnecessary.
“We’ve got colts that are worth
$100,000. There’s no way you’re
going to hurt a horse that you’ve
got that much investment in.”

Gilmer and Barnett were
among 10 walking horse owners,
and breeders who

showed up at Windsong Farms
last week to defend the industry
that brings millions of dollars
into the state with horse shows.
Tennessee walking horses be-
gin training barefoot and even-
tually build up to wearing pads
attached to their front hooves.
Chains or bracelets also are at-

tached around the ankles of the
horse.

The horses have a distinctive
' high gait, which puts the animal
on its back legs. The pads are
used as a “weighted balance to
allow the horse, under proper
training, to balance itself off its
back end,” said Bill Brennan, a
former walking horse exhibitor
who arranged the meeting.

The pads stay on the horse ex-
cept when they are removed ev-
ery four to six weeks to reset the
hoof. As for the chains, they
“give them action, and make
them step in front,” said Jackie
McConnell, who operates Wind-
song. “(The IO-ounce) chains
add weight to them so they pick
them up and try to sling them
off. They’re trying to walk out of
them.” .

Moratorium on Ammo

United Press International
Washington

A panel of ethicists, envi-
ronmentalists and theologians
'urged yesterday a moratorium
on the patenting of genetically
altered animals, calling it “a
matter of deep Philosophical
and spiritual concern.”

“The ethical, environmental,
socioeconomic and theological ram-
ifications of genetic engineering
and patenting of life are profound.”
the group said in a statement.

“They point to the probability
3 that the integrity and future of ore
. ation will be placed in even greater
Jeopardy if our power over the '
genes of life is not exercised pruo .
'dently and with reverence to help .

AJ‘.

The higher the step, the more
action from the horse, the better
judges in horse shows like it.

But there are those who think
the four-inch pads and 10-ounce
chains hurt the animals by mak-
ing their legs sore and altering
their gait.

“I can’t understand why this
magnificent animal cannot be
shown with its natural gait and
natural training without action
devices,” said Jean Sullivan, di-
rector of the Memphis Humane
Society. . .. What you’re doing
is altering the gait, and I don’t
understand why they would

- want to do it. It looks contrived.

It’s dreadfully unnatural.”

Dr. Tim Montague, a Milling-
ton veterinarian who has shown
Arabian horses for about three
years, said he has always be-
lieved that the alteration of the
gait hurts the horse’s joints.
“I’ve never felt it was a totally
painless type of training.”

restore the covenant: To heal the
Earth and ourselves.”

The statement stemmed from a
three-day consultation in suburban
Virginia sponsored by the New Cre-
ation Institute, Mlssoula, Mont, the
National Council of Churches, the
Humane Society, the Presbyterian
Church and other groups. It was
prompted by the Patent Office’s de
cision earlier this month to grant a
patent for genetically altered mice.

“This decision is a matter of a
deep philosophical and spiritual
concern,” the statement said. “It
portends fundamental change in
the public’s perception of, and atti-
tudes toward animals, which would
be regarded as human creations, in-
ventions and commodities rather
than as God’s creation or subject of
nature."

 

 

w

. ., The as. Wesley Granberg-Mio 3

inchaelson, head of the New Creation
3 Institute, said the call for a morate
5' rium on the granting of patents

does not mean that the ethicists and
theologians oppose all applications
of biotechnology nor its potential
use in medical research.

“Rather,” he said, “it declares
that extending the patenting pro-
cess to higher life forms, including
human genetic characteristics, will
give a powerful economic incentive
to assumptions which view life sole-
ly as if it were a material human
invention.”

“The result is an arrogant and ’

mechanized view of the created or-

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for letting me know of your support for strong
reauthorization of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

As you know, this legislation is before Congress for
reauthorization this year, and the Senate Subcommittee on
National Ocean Policy held hearings on its status and
implementation in April. At these hearings, many of the concerns
you raise were brought out, and Senator Kerry, who chaired the
hearings, gave his assurances that they would be addressed by the
subcommittee.

As you may know, I have been a consistent and strong
supporter of legislation such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act
which ensures, as far as possible, the protection of our wildlife
and the conservation of their habitat. I assure you that I will
have your thoughts prominent in my mind when this reauthorization
package comes before me later this year.

Thank you again for taking the time to share your concerns
with me. I hope you will continue to keep me informed on issues
important to us all.

Si c rely,

mﬁaﬂkﬁ.

llie North showed up. So
did Andy Rooney, Gucci,
Garbo, Lili Marlene, Em-
mett Kelly, Maxwell
Smart, Mr. Tibbs, Loretta
Young and Lancer, the Easter Lassie.

Andy, Opie and Barney checked 1n. As
did Donna the Iguana, Buck the Deer
and the incomparable Doodleberrie.

And nobody didn’t like Sara Lee.

But Michael Biff carried the day with
his amazing “see-ya-round” cat-fish 1m-
itation, netting for his proud parents —
the Campaus of Coral Springs —- $200
and the title of all-round world champi-
on and T0p, uh, Dog 1n our second annu-
al My Pet Is Pretty Darned Cute Ex-
travaganza.

Admit it, he bowls you over, too.

Michael Biff, known affectionately
by friends as “Mikey,” triumphed over
968 other entries that included, among
other contenders: a certified poodle ac-
countant, a dog named Einstein ponder-

ling grrrrrelativity, a pizza-eating cock-
Eatoo and a toilet-trained cat named
Coconut — caught doing his amazing,
gravity defying trick.

He also outshined at least 200 assort-
ed critters in sunglasses, topped 15 dogs
with antlers and, with a name like Biff,
out yuppied Muffy, Buffy, Bitsy, Peach-
es and Spike.

Sarge, the amazing wonder pup from
Hollywood who took top honors in last
year’s contest (it didn’t became a bone
fido extravaganza until this year),
didn’t give up the crown easily. In fact,
he doggedly pursued the prize with his
combination William Conrad-Bruce
Springsteen-Marlon Brando imitation.
(His prize money last year, we’re in-
formed, was used to combat that touch
of mange on his tail. It was well spent,
Sarge; always glad to help out.)

Mikey’s $200 cash bonanza already is
going for a steamed shrimp dinner for

one. If he keeps this up, he surely will at-
tain cash cow status.

And, Speaking of imitations — which
we were before we got sidetracked —
don’t miss our runners-up. Kasha, a fawn

doberman, did a keen pig with antlers e

unimaginative naming -— showed real
Spunk in his attempt to give new meaning
to the well- -worn phrase, “Let sleeping
dogs lie.”

Fifty bucks each to owners Sharon
Jones of Oakland Park and Jan and Bar-
ry Stern of Lantana They, by the way,
have made major headway in making
pets pay their way all the time — Jones
is a professional pet-sitter and Barry
Stern is a Boca ‘Raton vet.

We do have also-rans. Boofous, who
was entered no less than 25 times, is rec-
ognizable by any of us at 50 paces. (His
owner, heavens knows his real name, en-
tered the mutt under at least three ad-
dresses and used his eat,- his two guppies
and a houseplant as Boofous’ legal guard-
ian.)

Also grabbing our attention was Bud, a
cat who persists in wearing a yellow
plastic Sun-Sentinel wrapper. Not only
did Bud’s Full Plastic Jacket win raves
for originality but a commendation for
Most Blatant Attempt to Sway Our Team
of Unbiased Judges.

We had, mind you, four such attempts
— mostly with small animals pretending
to read the newspaper. Two attempts
were foiled because the paper was not
ours and two foundered because the pet

was, like Ollie North, more interested‘in

,3hredding it than standing behind it for
,ail time.

Tsk.

As for you people who sneaked in pic-
tures of cute children — with the name of
the dog on their lips but nowhere else in
the photo -- you deserve special men-
tion. Your ploy almost worked, then the
feds called and said something about
Truth in Advertising. Sorry.

There were, of course, more blatant
attempts to get to our contest cash. One
dog goes to the track five times a week
and stated rather dogmatically that he
needed the cash. Another talked to us
about pet pet charities. And another —-
points here for honesty — just wished to
get on a more permanent gravy train.

Now —— for those who are counting -—
something for you numbers nuts. Among
the 969 entries there were: 549 dogs, 323
cats, 30 birds, 26 with two kinds of ani-
mals in the picture, and 41 others. The
others included a pig, a deer, a horse, a
spider, a duck, a mouse, bunnies, rac-
coons, lizards, iguanas, guinea pigs, ham-
sters, ferrets, fish and a single stuffed an-
imal — owner allergic.

And let’s do a paragraph or two on
names. The most common ones: Buttons,

' Ginger, Daisy, Tabby, Missy, Brandy,

Muffin, Snuggles and Tiffany. The most
interesting: Hifalutin McThree, Tiger

Michael Biff, owned by the Campaus of Coral Springs, won the top
prize of $200 for his “cat- fish” imitation.

 




Eugene, Erisky Business, Tort Reform (a
trying cat) and Gomer Sue, a beagle.

Royalty — like earls and sirs and la-
dies and a Princess Di (perched on a
throne, no less) — proliferated; magic
animals, too — we had Merlyn, Houdini,
Charlie the Magic Dog and Maxi-mum
Magic von J ager.

On a more serious note, we heard a lot
of wonderful stories from a lot of won-
derful peOple who obviously love their
animals. Quite a few entries came from
people who explained they had rescued
abused pets from what must have been
certain death.

In fact, official runner-up Kasha was
saved by the Doberman Rescue League
after being abused by attack dog train-
ers. And official runner-up Dane is deaf,
having been dropped off 41/: years ago at
Dr. Stern’s office to be destroyed because
he was “defective.”

We were impressed by Caroline Soko-
loski’s letter about Samantha, her be-
loved Siamese who walks backward be-
cause her front legs are crippled. The
Sokoloskis have installed a special eating
shelf and a boffo lounge box for Sa-
mantha and found a second cat who is her
constant companion. -

We also heard from North Miami’s
Rose Marie Baillie, who has four dogs,
three of which are blind. She is disabled
as well -— and they do just fine, thank
you. In fact, Baillie is involved in trying
to place unwanted animals in good
homes.

And, lastly, we were touched by Tam-
pa, an English bull terrier who is compa-
ny to recovering alcoholic and drug-
abusing women at an area halfway
house.

“My only job,” the Fort Lauderdale
dog writes, “is to love them uncondition-
ally. And it is the best job in the whole
world.”

That’s the way we felt when we got to
judge this contest. ,._v ‘

. MARTINEZ, Calif. -— The accidental release

~* 9f at least 175,000 gallons of a particularly goo-

Local boat owners, many of whom make a liv~

the oil will harm the coast’s delicate food chain
and possibly deplete fish stocks already reduced .
by decades of water quality problems in the del-
ta.

Most of the 400 boats at the city’s marina still
had oil on their hulls this weekend; under federal
regulations, they cannot leave docks until they
are cleaned. Shell promised to pick up the tab.

Harbor master Barry Wysling closed the ma-
rina until all oil slicks are removed from the

fishermen from participating in today’s open-

Shell spokesman Bill Sharkey said the compa-

HOW DOES ONE acquire a cat
here? Well, I’d say word-of-mouth
is the premier avenue to feline
ownership: In our circle of friends,
someone’ 3 cat is usually in a fam-
ily way, and early marketing be-
gins with assertions of how adora-
ble and good- natured the mother
is, weeks before her “lying-in.”

Then there are the cats that just
sort of show up on the doorsill, a
neighborhood stray or an acquaint-
ance of one’s own cat comes to
dinner. I suppose people do buy
cats in pet stores, but that seems to
me a last resort, especially given
the selection available at the ani-
mal shelter.

Our own cats have all arrived in
the arms of a suppliant child who
“found him. Mom, and isn’t he
cute?” Of course it’s “he” until
proven otherwise, .with the rare
exception of our ”current cat in-
residence, Peac 3. He was se-
lected partly on the assumption he
was a female, since we feel a
neutered female becomes a better
pet than even a neutered male.

named “her” Peaches, for “her”
pale fuzzy coat. He does have the
sweetest disposition of any cat
we’ve ever had, although he is also
the most timid. Open the door to
let him in, and a broom unexpect-
edly left leaning against the door-
frames is enough to send him into
wild-eyed terror. We suspect his
eyesight lacks the acuity cats are
famous for.

But back to Mary’s letter. Our
girls have always loved cats and
agreed that the very worst part of

leaving home for a college dorm or
'a rented apartment was that they

have not been able to have pets.
Mary is settled now, in Stuttgart,
and so last fall she sought to
correct her feline deﬁcits.

“We now have a cat. Haven’t
seen much of her since she arrived.
She’s been hiding in ever-more-
sophisticated places. Right now
she’s purring on my lap, but she’s
sure to disappear again. So far,
after 28 (which she scratched out)
36 (scratched out) 60 hours she
hasn’t drunk, eaten, or used her
litter box as far as I know.

“SHE’S SEVEN months old,
still female, kind of dark and spot-
ted, short hair. We’d actually
called Katzen-Hilfe — a cat-helping
society —- twice back in November
and December, and never heard
back from them.

This time, I guess we passed the
phone inspection because we were
given the name of a person who
keeps cats temporarily. We went
and visited the cat in her apart-
ment, where there were also four
other cats, and two days later the
lady brought her us. I guess so she
could check out our apartment.

“In two weeks we sign a con-
tract. Unannounced visits are also
possible. They take their business
very seriously! You’d think they
were doing us a favor!”

(My note: I’m sure they do. Here,
there is such a surfeit of homeless
cats, the adopter is doing the adop-
tee the favor, not vice versa. In
Germany, it is rare to see a cat on
the street. .

“OUR LANDLORD upstairs
said we could have a cat if it
stayed inside. The cat next door
apparently razes bird nests in our
back yard. (Another area the Ger-
mans take very seriously. They
love birds. Every home has a
feeder, and in the winter, you can
see suet bags hanging from bushes
in public parks.) Not ideal, of
course, but this kitty is used to
being inside. I just hope she ad-
justs to not having any play—
mates.”

Actually Mary called from Ger-
many just before putting her letter
in the mail, nearly frantic that her
kitty had not eaten or -— anything.
She said she settles down and
purrs with petting, but otherwise
stays hidden, apparently simply
petriﬁed of her new surroundings.

Mary was worried that the
Katzen-Hilfe people would drop in
and ﬁnd the cat dead or emotion-
ally traumatized, and declare
Mary unﬁt, in which case she’d
never be able to adopt a cat!

HER FRIEND Peter did not
have pets as a child, and doesn’t
quite know what to do with one.
She said she found him holding the
cat on his lap at the piano, trying
to show her something he was
composing.

Peter’s really into modern
music. That may be their problem _
right there. I think I’ll suggest
they stay with Beethoven’s “Fur
Elise” or the Brahm’s lullaby.
They’re good German songs, but
much more soothing than 1988-
vintage Beyer.

Parrot Warns Man Of Fire, Is Killed By Fumes

BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — An
African gray parrot alerted her
. owner by calling out his name
when a Teﬂon-coated pan caught

fire, and then was killed by the'
fumes after the fire was

extinguished.

The parrot, Coco, belonged to
Chris Barnes, a student at the Uni-
versity of Colorado. Barnes, 21, who
shares a house with five other stu-
dents in Boulder.

Barnes said one roommate had
arrived home early Saturday and
put a pot of water on the stove to

make spaghetti.

The roommate went to his room
and made a telephone call, then
fell asleep while the water boiled
away.

About 4:30 am, Barnes heard
Coco screeching in the living room,
next to the kitchen, and then call-
ing his name.

He got up and found the kitchen
filled with smoke and the Teﬂon
lining of the pot aflame.

Barnes put out the fire and aired
out the room. Coco appeared to be
all right. But several minutes later,

two counts of driving under the influ-

Louis Quintana, 29, also pleaded no
contest to a charge of leaving the
scene of an accident that resulted in a
death. His trial was to have begun on
Monday,

The police dog’s sleuthing was im-
portant because it enabled authori-
ties to find Quintana fast and test him
for drunkeness before he became so-
ber, prosecutor Barry Goldstein said.

After his arrest, Quintana ’8 blood
alcohol level measured .26 percent
on his first test, and .25 percent on his
second, Goldstein said. A level of .10
percent is the legal minimum for
drunken driving.

Guy Williams Jr., 30, and Patricia
Kurgan, 24, were killed by the Cadil-

Kurgan was a chef at the Bonaven-

guard. He was escorting her to her
car when the accident occurred.

After a journey of perhaps one-

Captain led Bartolome to an apart—

Was this where they would find
Quintana? No. The dog veered off
to the left, sniffing all the way.

Soon, Captain stopped at a sec-

Quintana did go to the first

Mist lifts
for gorillas

O A remarkable success story is coming
out of Rwanda. Jeremy Gavron reports

N THE DAMP under-
1 growth of nettles and bamo

boo forest on the slopes of
Rwanda’s Parc National des
Volcans, in the heart of Africa,
we are sitting in the way of a
mountain gorilla. She grunts
gently, and sways forward on
her knuckles, peering at us
through the mist.

We huddle deeper into a
.» bush of burning nettles to let
her pass, but instead she ﬁnds
ia fallen bamboo stalk and
j climbs delicately up and over
us, into a tree and then down
. towards the rest of her group.

‘ Ten years ago, the. mountain
i gorilla was close to extinction.
Larger and hairier than its
more numerous eastern and
’ western lowland cousins, only
;400 of the mountain apes
remained in the wild, with
‘ none in capitivity.

They live only on the for-
gested slopes of the Virunga
5 volcanoes. which straddle the
5 borders of Zaire. Uganda and
; Rwanda, and in the impenetra-
‘ ble forest in Uganda. In the
Virungas alone, the number of
gorillas fell from close to 500 in
1960 to around 250 in 1980.

For decades, poachers such
as the Twa pygmies had
hunted gorillas for their skulls
and hands, which they sold to
Europeans, as well as for the
babies that zoos would buy.
And human encroachment was
eating into the edges of the
park: between 1960 and 1980,
almost half of the Parc des Vol-
? cans was given to farmers.

. The mountain gorilla was
T being pushed into the “moun-
. tain mist of times past”, wrote
Dian Fossey, an American who
i lived among these apes for 20
years, in her 1983 book,
“Gorillas in the Mist". With-
out help, she concluded,
gorilla gorilla berengei was
destined to become “a species
discovered and extinct in the
same century.”

Today, happily, such pessi-
mism is starting to fade. Partly
because of the attention Fos-
sey drew to the plight of the
mountain gorilla, a joint pro-
ject between the Rwandan
1 government and a consortium

of conservation groups, led by
the African Wildlife Founda—
tion, was set up in 1979 to save
the animal.

In its nine years, the Moun-
tain Gorilla Project (MGP) has
been a striking success. Last
year, a gorilla count in the
Virungas found at least 279
gorillas—an increase of more
than 10 per cent in seven years.

The MGP’s success has been
based not on trying to impose
ivory tower, western aesthet-
ics on a poor African country,
but on making live gorillas
valuable to the Rwandans.
Dian Fossey had shown how,
with long months of patient
effort, a group of gorillas could
become habituated to the pres-
ence 'of people. The MGP
decided that what was good for
impoverished researchers
could also work for tourists
with cash in their pockets.

In 1979, Mark Condiotti, now
the MGP's assistant director,
began the weary task of habitu-
ating gorillas for tourists.‘
Every day for six months, Con-
diotti and a Rwandan guide
would walk up into the forest,
often trudging several hours
before finding the chosen
group. “When I got too close
the silverback would charge,”
recalls Condiotti. “I would get
down and freeze and he would
thump the ground and shake
branches.”

Today, four groups—of 62
gorillas in all—can be visited
by a maximum of six tourists,
for one hour a day. The walk,
sometimes three or four hours'
long, through magical forests
of bamboo and giant heather,
followed by an hour sitting in
the midst of a group of wild
gorillas, provides a unique
African tourist safari.

Inevitably, the MGP has
been criticised for “taming”
the gorillas. But Craig Sholley,
the director of the MGP, has
simple answers.

First, the behaviour of the
gorillas who play host to tour-
ists does not appear to be any
different from the fully wild
groups. And if the gorillas '
were disturbed, they could eas-
ily fade into the thick bush.

 




4%,.

Bak om the brink: the mountain gorilla, which was fac

Secondly, it is the tourism
that is safegUarding the
species. “If it were possible.
then of course I’d prefer the
gorillas to be left alone,‘ Shol-

ley says. “But it’s not.” Each-

tourist now pays £100 for his
hour with the gorillas. In 1979.
the whole of Rwanda had a
total of 1,788 tourists. Last
year, 4,500 tourists came just
to see the gorillas.

Some of the money the
gorillas earn goes to the
government in the shape of
precious foreign exchange.
The money has also allowed
the park to build up one of the
best paid, best equipped and
best trained staffs in Africa. At
any time, six patrols, each with

four to six men, are on week-
long scouting trips, watching
for traps and poachers.

Since 1984, not one gorilla on
the Rwandan side has died at
the hands of poachers. But
snares laid for other animals
remain a problem. A gorilla
which gets its wrist or ankle
caught in a metal snare can
develop gangrene and lose the
limb or die. The guards are
given bonuses for the snares
they- bring in—and each
month they ﬁnd dozens.

Many local people now have
jobs as guides, guards, porters
and workers in the little guest
house, and slowly the attitude
towards the gorillas is
changing.

Pcture: JEREMY GAVRON

ign extinctnl years ago

Later this year, a major ﬁlm
of “Gorillas in the Mist”, shot
in Kenya and Rwanda, is set
for release. Tourism is bound
to shoot up —guaranteeing
more dollars for the park. In
Zaire, too, a project run by the
Frankfurt zoo and modelled on
the MGP, is becoming more
popular with tourists. Another
is starting up in Uganda.

Despite its success, the MGP
is by no means complacent.
One epidemic could wipe out a
large chunk of the population.
“We’re still dealing with a very
shaky situation,” says Craig
Sholley. “But I think it’s fairly
safe to say now that the moun~
tain gorilla is going to accom-
pany us into the let century. ”

According to Barbara Tregellas,
chairman, “those attending will
have a fantasy sneak preview of
the Ford Motor Company’s African
Rain Forest, which will bring a
section of the African wilderness to
Atlanta with three gorilla families.
The Concept behind the Ford Afri-
can Rain Forest is ‘landscape 1m-
mersion’ meaning that visitors and
buildings are deep within nature
“in the vegetation that was chosen
to simulate the West African rain
forest habitat.”

’ Other events at the Beastly

Feast will be a Silent Auction, .:

Ford Motor Pool, music by the
Modernaires and dinner by Proof
of the Pudding.

Many celebrities will be in at-
tendance, including Jean Smart

7(Charlene) of Designing Women

and Jim Fowler of Wild Kingdom.
' Ms. Tregallas says “with all the
Penthusiasm and support for this
event, Zoo Atlanta is on the way to
becoming the World’s Next Great
Zoo.”

Little Rock Zoo
Began With Two

It all began with a wolf whose owner
didn’t reclaim him from a kennel.
Then a bear cub arrived. Both lived in
a poultry house at the south end of
Little Rock’s Markham Street, where
the state fair was held. A watchman
tenderly cared for the two orphans.

Although these beginnings in the
1920’s were modest and somewhat
haphazard, those adjectives no longer
apply to the Little Rock Zoo. About
500 animals now reside here, attract-

{L'

ing 350,000 visitors annually.

Little Rock’s Department of Parks
and Recreation operates the zoo, a
40-acre spread with native-stone build-
ings and walls built by the WPA in the
1930’s. Elevated walkways allow you
to look down into exhibit areas to
watch the animals playing, feeding,
and resting. Maybe you’ll spot the Pa-
tagonian cavy, a harelike mammal,
bouncing on all four legs up to 3
feet into the air. Or the blue-necked

ostrich may catch your eye when it
stretches its long legs and bats big
eyes that are larger than its brain.

While at the 200, you can also see
the seven anteaters, one of the largest
collections in the country. Although
the anteaters will happily consume
20,000 ants apiece every day, the zoo
feeds them a more manageable feast of
dogfood. Those odd-looking animals
have a humorous air about them as
they lumber around on their knuckles.
The anteaters poke their dispropor-
tionately long, tube-shaped heads
along the ground while searching for
edible tidbits. Last year, baby anteater
Spud rode on her mother’s back, a
habit youngsters continue until they’re
about 7 months old.

Although this baby wallowed in
comforting warmth, not all animal
babies may have that luxury. Some-
times mothers become hostile, and
their young are removed and given
temporary shelter in the nursery.
There you can see primate babies
swing from ropes or play with teddy
bears. When they are old enough, the
babies are moved to the Primate
Building or the Great Ape House.

Across the duck pond from the nur-
sery is the Zoopermarket, where you
can munch on specialties such as the
Gobbler turkey sandwich, corned beef
on Rhino, or the Polar Bare—frozen
yogurt. Sitting in the outdoor pavilion
overlooking the pond, you will be en—
tertained by the antics of the pink ﬁa—
mingos, Australian black swans, white
pelicans, wood ducks, Canada geese,
and rare European shell ducks.

 

The 200, located in War Memorial
Park, is open daily from 9:30 am. to 5
pm. For more information, contact

Primate House
at zoo is closed
for improvements

 

By John Beifuss
Staff Reporter

 

One of the Memphis Zoo’s most
popular attractions —- the Pri-
mate House --- will be closed un-
til July 30.

Most of the building’s 36 apes
and monkeys have been moved
to the zoo hospital or other off-
exhibit cages because of several
construction projects, including
removal of asbestos.

However, four of the largest
and most popular inhabitants ——
Kwashi and Tammy the gorillas
and Sally and Chickie the oran-
gutans -— are boarding at the Lit-
tle Rock Zoo. .

Only the noisy siamang apes
and the black-and-white colobus
monkeys will remain in their
regular exhibits, because these
cages can be sealed off from the
areas where work is taking
place.

The construction also in-
cludes new roofing, a new heat-
ing and air-conditioning system,
and new educational graphics. It
will cost about $300,000, mostly
from the city maintenance bud-
get. The building closed and
work began last week.

 

Zoo director Charles Wilson
said the asbestos was discovered
on pipes and ceiling tiles in
March. The construction pro-
jects in the building were sched-
uled to begin in the spring, but
the city first had to take bids for
the removal of asbestos. That is
why the work was not able to be-
gin until the peak attendance
season.

Asbestos is‘ a substance that
has been linked to cancer and
other ailments.

“The asbestos was not a dan-
ger as it was, but when you dis-
turb it, then you disturb the par-
ticulate matter which gets in the
lungs,” Wilson said. He said,
monkeys are susceptible to this
as well as humans.

Wilson said it took about four
days to relocate the apes and
monkeys. Many of them had to
be immobilized for the move,
but none was hurt, he said.

Although most of the improve-
ments will be behind the scenes,
visitors will notice a new educa-
tional area in the middle of the
Primate House. It will include
informational graphics,
benches and exotic plants, said
Barbara Moses, curator of educa-
tion at the zoo.

Two polar bear cubs, whose
mother was shot and killed last
month near Nome, Alaska, hud-
dle together ina tempOrary shel-
ter at the Anchorage zoo. The
cubs were taken from the wild by
officials who feared that the
young animals would not survive
long without their mother. Wild-
life workers have been search-
ing for a permanent home for the
bears, but until the cute little
critters are old enough to fend
for themselves, they will remain
in their special quarters at the
zoo and will have to count on hu-
man keepers to make sure they
stay out of trouble and are
raised properly.

At first Bob Johnson thought his
dogs, Penny and Lightning, were
soaking up the spring sunshine in

. front of his Cherokee County home.

‘ “I walked out and saw one of

' them [Penny] laying like he was

. asleep, but he didn’t look right,”
Johnson said. “I touched him and
he Was stone dead.”

Seconds later, Lightning fell
over With convulsions. The next
day, he was dead.

Six that were officially reported to
the Cherokee County Sheriff’s De-
partment as having been poisoned.
The Cherokee County Humane Soci-
ety, however, estimates between 25
and 50 dogs were poisoned between
March 28 and May 7.

According to Maj. Bill Rymer of
the Sheriffs Department, six dogs
were poisoned with strychnine dur-
ing the first week of April. The own-
ers of five of the dogs lived on
Ridge Road in Canton. The dogs
were found poisoned in their yards
or nearby.

ATLANTA JOURNAL - May 12, 1988

Cherokee County has few clues

Humane Society officials say
the poisonings have continued since
early April and that as many as 20
have occurred in the Ridge Road
area. The society is offering a $1,000
reward for information leading to
an arrest, and a resident whose dog
was poisoned is offering another
$500 reward.

Helen Chaffin, treasurer of the
Humane Society, is still mourning
the death of her dog, Caesar. The
black Labrador was poisoned April
19 in the back yard of her house on
Ridge Road, she said.

“Through my grief and my fury,

in dogs’ poison

I can’t see anything but inhumane
action,” she said.

Although no motive is known for
the poisonings, some residents of
the Canton neighborhood speculate
the poisonings are the work of
would-be thieves. According to one
resident, the community experi-
enced a rash of poisonings followed
by a string of burglaries about three
years ago.

Other residents believe whoever
poisoned the dogs considered them
a nuisance.

, “You’d‘xbe surprised, but the
mentality is out there. Some peOple

poison a dog who knocks down their
garbage or barks all the time,” said

veterinarian Dr. Gayle Miller, who

has treated 15 poisoning cases in
the past month.

While most of the poisonings

have involved pets in Canton, re-‘

ports are being received from
across the county.

“I’ve heard the 50 number
kicked around,” said Dr. Mike
Christopher, another local veteri—
narian. “I only know personally of
about 12 cases.”

Strychnine is readily available

deaths

at most hardware stores and is fre-
quently used to kill rodents. Au-
thorities believe the poison was
laced in ground beef.

Deputies have located no physi-
cal evidence and pinpointed no mo-
tive. “It’s not an easy case to solve.
All you’ve got is a dead dog,” Rymer
said.

“People don’t necessarily call
the sheriff when their dogs dead,”
Humane Society director Otis
Moore said. “But this is just das-
tardly. There are a lot of reasons
why it shouldn’t happen, but it is.”

Cats still crawling out of cracks
of stench-filled Hapeville house

By Adam Gelb
Staff Writer

On Naomi Carstarphen’s block,
it’s not raining cats and dogs. It’s
raining cats and more cats.

A week after city sanitation
crews finished a four-day excava-
tion of her Hapeville house, found
April 26 teeming with 29 cats and
piled waist-high in trash plastered
with cat feces, as many as 30 more
cats have come out of the wood-
work and created a neighborhood
nuisance.

“We’re not amused no more,”

said next-door neighbor Rose.

Sweeten. “You can’t go outside
without having cats all around

you.

Fulton County animal control
officers, who thought they had
captured all of the cats, on
Wednesday set up humane wire-
box traps with sardine lures
around the house at 3106 Grove
Circle to snag the stragglers.

“We have no idea where they
were hiding,” said Ron Totten, an
animal control official. “They
didn’t show themselves when we

,were in there before.”

One cat not caught in the ini-
tial sweep gave birth to five kit-
tens, discovered beneath ‘the gar-.
bage by sanitation workers,
officials said. ,

All but three of the animals
captured so far have been de-
stroyed, Totten said. “Because of
the conditions they were living in
and their poor health, they
wouldn’t have made good pets.”

Neighbors called Hapeville
police to the one-story, wood-
frame house last month after a
stench began seeping through the
walls. Officers initially believed
Mrs. Carstarphen’s husband may
have been buried under the rub-
ble, but later determined he is in
a nursing home in Augusta.

Police say Mrs. Carstarphen.

cans were piled chest-high in the

' Ordered by city officials to
clean the house or pay the city to
do it, Mrs. Carstarphen arrived to
start the job but turned away when
accosted by television news crews,
officials said. She has declined to
speak with reporters or explain the
mess to authorities.

Her bill came to $1,500. She has
30 days to pay or the city will place
a lien on the house, said Hapeville
Public Service Director Joe Hind—
man.

Mrs. Carstarphen was not
charged with cruelty to animals but
has been cited for city health and
sanitation code violations, Hindman

said. “She’s still got a lot of work to

do.”
Neighbors say that while the

Firm tracks down
woodland refugees

By Rebecca Powers
News Staff Writer

Some people get spring fever. Big
city trapper Kevin Clark gets busy.

“I’ve got raccoons coming out of
my ears,” said Clark, a one-time
Metro Detroit chimney sweep who
turned his rooftop expertise into a
growing urban animal-nabbing busi-

ness called Critter Control.

Sure as the crocuses nose through

the ground, springtime urges
raccoons to set up housekeeping in
the nearest chimney. And woodland
refugees, coping in an urban land-
scape, are proliferating, Clark said.

THE SPRINGTIME phenom-
enon has Clark’s Critter Control
staff answering 35 to 40 calls a day.

“Mostly, it’s raccoons, skunks,
bats and birds,” Clark said.

But it doesn’t stop there. Since
he started the business six years ago,
Clark has tranquilized a deer on a
golf course and carted geese from
cemeteries.

Currently, his staff is stalking a
raccoon living in luxury behind and
above a Southfield restaurant.

NOT LONG AGO, Critter
Control resolved the case of the cat
in the supermarket. During the day,
. the creature would slip out of sight

beneath the ﬂoor boards. “At night it
would jump into the meat rack and
nibble on prime fillets,” Clark said.

“A lot of people don’t believe
urban wildlife is that much of a
problem,” Clark said — until they
get an uninvited critter, that is.

A spokesman for the National
Animal Damage Control Associa-
tion put it this way: “Animals look
good on public television. But when
they come into the house, oh, do
people get paranoid.”

The paranoia gave Critter Con-
trol a bit of business last year ——
2,500 displaced creatures, including
one macaw.

COMPUTERS IN Clark’s
basement-level Westland headquar-
ters track the volume of catches.
With 21 locations around the coun-
try, the business is much larger than
the one-man operation Clark started
with a rusty station wagon and a few
college biology classes under his belt.

The pests have been good to him.

bunch of spray jockeys where, if it’s
a bug, you spray it, and if it’s an
animal, you poison it,” Clark said.
The new school of thought on urban ’
wildlife —- as Clark calls the pesky
animals —— is live trapping and tran- ‘
quilizing.

BUT, FIRST the interlopers
must be caught.

_ This time of year, a dollop of
peanut butter and a marshmallow ~—
raccoon favorites —— pretty much do
the job. ‘

Once the prey is in the cage, it’s
off to a ﬁeld or culvert somewhere

she shouted to someone wandering

as well be sitting next to a turnip,
you can’t hear a word. This is
enough to wake the shrimp.”

Hmmm, the plateful of bar-
becued shrimp sleeping before her
never seemed to mind. Or at least
they were duly devoured before
they awoke. ’

Farther south in the dining
room—if that is what one calls an
AstrdTurf carpeted salon under a
bulbous clear plastic tent—Brooks
McCormick, something of a
dynast from Du P e, was sawing
away on his rack 0 baby lamb but
ceased for a moment to chat
about the zoo.

With such a hefty contingent of
Hinsdaleans at the Whirl, was
Cook County’s Brookﬁeld the pet
zoo of Du Page?

“No, the Du Page Zoo is in
Oak Brook,” Mr. McCormick
said, poking ﬁrn at the polo set.

Another gent having a meny old
time in the tent was Louis Sudler
Jr., who let down his hair as the
night wOre on.

Tiptoein into dinner—one had
to be care I of divots along the
walk—the real estate mogul eyed
one of the ﬂock of papier maché
pink flamingoes, in various states
of repose around the room, and
quipped: “Well, I certainly want
one of those for my front lawn.”

It is doubtful the neighbors on
North Lakeview, across from the
Lincoln Park lagoon, would take
kindly to such a show of déclassé.

But, heck this was the Whirl,
and a night at the zoo seems to
bring out the beast in all of us.

DeKalb residents have two op-
portunities in May and June to win a
Caribbean sailing cruise.

The Moorings, a sailboat charter
operation based on the island of
Tortola in the British Virgin Islands,
has donated a week-ion cruise on a
51-foot sailboat comple e with cap-
tain and cook and provisions as a
door prize for the Beastly Feast
benefit at Zoo Atlanta Saturday,
May 14.

In addition, the Moorings has
provided a similar cruise for the
WPBA-TV Channel 30 auction June
6-12. The auction will raise funds for
the public broadcasting station.

Air accommodations for both
prizes are being donated by Eastern
Airlines and Air BVI to Tortola.

The British Virgin Islands are
known for their unspoilt beaches,
excellent scuba diving, snorkeling,
deep-sea fishing and sailing. ,

Principal islands in the chain are
Tortola and Virgin Gorda.

Virgin Gorda is famous for its
“Baths,” a series of pools and
channels that flow underneath piles
of volcanic boulders along the coast.

Other islands include Anegada,
Cooper, Jost van Dyke, Salt, Peter,
Norman, Dead Chest and Great
Dog, names reminiscent of days
when pirates sailed the Caribbean
Sea.

Robert Lewis Stevenson’s
“Treasure ‘ Island” is believed to
have been inspired by uninhabited
Norman Island.

Salt Island is a popular spot for
scuba divers who come to see the
wreck of the Rhone, a British mail
ship that sank after being smashed
against a reef by a hurricane in 1867.
Underwater scenes for the film
“The Deep” were filmed at the

DECATUR/DEKALB NEIGHBOR -

Caribbean cruise, hote

The islands surround Sir Francis
Drake Channel, which offers some
of the finest sailing in the Carib-
bean. The channel draws yachtsmen
from all over the world for races
and regattas.

Anegada is just northeast of the
Puerto Rican Trench noted for its
fabulous fishing. Dolphin, blue and
white marlin, sailfish and tuna are

abundant.

he biggest, the oldest, the newest,

the hottest . . . many U. S. zoos boast
unique claims to zoological fame.

. Whether you prefer to gaze at the apes

_ in the greatest gorilla exhibit or to trek
'ough the biggest indoor complex, America

has a 200 to interest you.

And if memories of dank, smelly monkey

houses make you turn up your nose, you can

breathe easily There’s a new breed of zoos out
there today. New naturalistic exhibits have

‘clanged shut the cage doors of old. Lush land-

scaping threads throughout the grounds of the
modern zoo, woven into exhibits in some cases
as fascinating as the animals. Creatures once
timid at their newfound freedom now roam con-
tentedly in expansive settings.

So take a walk on the wild side and explore
the many offerings of America’s zoos. Here’s
a sampling of zoos and their unusual features
awaiting you . . .

acres of the North Carolina Zoo. The land
area of this park gives new meaning to
the word vast, although only 300 acres
of it currently is used for exhibits. Hardy
souls still may hike through the 200’s un-
developed woodlands area, however.

One of the first zoos to plan com-
pletely around the natural-habitat con—
cept, the North Carolina Zoo completed
its ﬁrst exhibit area, the African region,
in 1984. Six other regions are planned,
including the ZOO-acre North American
region, which was started this spring and
is slated for completion in 1991. The last
of these regions probably will not be fin—' '
ished until after the turn of the century,
zoo ofﬁcials predict.

In the 300-acre African region, look
for white rhinos, elephants, giraffes, ze-
bras, Ostriches and crazy baboons. More
than 700 animals and 15,000 exotic plants
are featured. In addition to the outdoor
exhibits, there are two impressive indoor
exhibits: Under the 18,000—square-foot
plexiglass dome of the R. J. Reynolds
Forest Aviary, you’ll ﬁnd 150 exotic birds
and thousands of plants. The 53,000-
square-foot indoor African Pavilion is
home to 200 animals from Africa, includ-
ing gorillas.

Location: S ix miles southeast ofAshe-
boro, ofo.S. 64, US. 220 andS.R. 159.

Information: (919) 879-5606.

THE OLDEST

The Zoological Society of
Philadelphia

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

July 1, 1874, marked the opening of
the Philadelphia Zoo, today the oldest in
the country. Visitors “oohed and aahed”
at the pachyderms in their elephant house
and admired the steep-roofed twin gate-
houses designed by a prominent local
architect. Nearly 100 years later, the
Victorian gatehouses remained, and el—
ephants could still be viewed, but the zoo
had “deteriorated into tenement housing
for the animal kingdom, ” according to an
architect’s report, with animals occupy-
ing only 5 percent of its 42 acres.

Then the 200’s renaissance began.
A 16-year plan calling for a complete re-
haul was adopted in 1979, and today the
zoo boasts some impressive exhibits,
particularly for children. Kids can ex—
plore the Treehouse exhibit: Sit in a
ﬂower, hatch from a giant egg or keep
warm in the nest, see the inside of a bee-
hive, or peer through a periscope to see
life in a pond from a tadpole’s view.
Opened in 1985, the Treehouse main—
tains the 200’s venerable image: It is
housed in the former Antelope House,
built in 1877.

Other old buildings remain on the

 




deer, Mexican gray wolves and several
species of birds. '

The museum recommends that you
allow a minimum of two hours for your
visit. Arrive early: Animals are more ac-
tive, the museum less crowded and, in
the summer, it is not as hot in the morn«
ing hours as later in the day.

Location: 2021 N. Kinney Rd.

Information: (602) 883-1380.

THE MOST EXOTIC

Miami Metrozoo
Miami, Florida

Bring your binoculars for a close-up
look at the exotic birds soaring through
the Wings of Asia aviary at the Miami
Metrozoo, one of the largest (280 acres
developed on the 740-acre site) and new-
est zoos (opened in 1981). Visitors stroll
through the acreoand-a-half rain-forest
environment of this exotic-bird eXhibit,
nesting grounds for hundreds of South-
east Asian birds. White tigers wander
through a replica of a 13th-century Cam-
bodian temple. Children can pet animals
in Sulwesi, a replica of a Malayan village.
In viewing caves at several exhibits, vis—
itors get a close-up view of the animals.

Elephants, elegant Grevy’s zebras,
striking black-and-white colobus mon-
keys, gorillas, black rhinos, giraffes, os-
triches and hoofed stock fill the zoo.
TrOpical flowers and plants enhance the
exotic atmosphere.

 

 

In keeping with the warm Florida
climate, the Metrozoo favors crocodiles
over arctic animals, so don’t bother look-
ing for polar bears.

Location: 12400 S. W 152 St. (Coral
Reef Drive).

Information: (305) 251-0400.

 

THE MOST POPULAR

San Diego Zoo
San Diego, California

More than three million people
flocked to the San Diego Zoo last year
(the number of visitors to the Bronx Zoo
was a close second). Lush exhibits, shirt—
sleeve weather and lots of exotic animals
helped draw the crowds to this popular
zoo. It was founded in 1916 in Balboa
Park, a hilly area that was once infested
with rattlesnakes.

This year, the crowds will enjoy the
mist and mystery of a new climatic ex-
hibit (one re—creating a natural climate).
Opened in March of this year, the Tiger
River: Kroc Family Tropical Rain Forest
covers about three acres and includes
habitats for 25 species of birds, several
species of large reptiles, alligatorlike
species and Sumatran tigers. Orchids,
ferns and date palms thrive in the heavy
rain-forest mist. A footpath at the bot-
tom of a 50—foot cliff leads into the ex-
hibit. Be on the lookout for a python that
lurks inside a tree trunk on the pathway
inside: The camouflaged glass that pro—
tects you from it is very well hidden.

After you’ve dried off from the rain

forest, check out some of the other ani-

' mals roaming free in their native habi—

tats. A Children’s Zoo with domestic
animals, spider and squirrel monkeys,
river otters, lesser pandas and a walk-
through aviary is scaled to the size of a
four-year-old (but enjoyable for all ages).
Reach out and touch the animals in the
Children’s Zoo, and smile at the baby pri-
mates in the glass-fronted nursery.

Hop on the Skyfari cable car for a
bird’s-eye view of the Reptile House, the
Monkey Mesa, great-ape grottos, wild-
sea—lion pool and exhibits on Horn and
Hoof Mesa. The ride offers a spectacular
view of the city, too, soaring over some
of highest areas of the zoo, which itself
is located far above the San Diego har-
bor. You can see also the 200’s canyons
and mesas on a three-mile guided bus
tour.

Lions, tigers, bears, elephants,
hippos, giraffes, koalas, the largest col-
lection of parrots and parrotlike birds—
they’re all at the San Diego Zoo.

If you have a second day, visit the
200’s “second campus,” the San Diego
Wild Animal Park. There’s a lot more
ground to cover in the Wild Animal Park,
where you can take in an animal show at
the Africa-inspired Nairobi Village, trek
along the Kilimanjaro Hiking Trail or take
a 50-minute safari aboard the Wgasa Bush
Line monorail through habitats of Africa
and Asia. More than 2,400 animals in
herds and flocks live in the park. A sep—
arate admission fee is required for the
Wild Animal Park, which is located be-
tween the cities of Ramona and Es-
condido.

Locations: San Diego Zoo: In Bal-
boa Park, near the intersection of US. 5
and Highway 163. San Diego Wild Ani-
mal Park: 30 miles north of downtown
San Diego via I-15/Highway 163.

THE MOST UDDERLY
DELIGHTFUL

 

Milwaukee County Zoo
Milwaukee, Wisconsin

Mooove on through the Dairy Com-
plex, beginning with the cow barn’s ex-
hibit of seven dairy cows. A restored 1896
octagonal barn, featuring educational ex—
hibits and a working modern milking par-
lor, is the next milk stop. Learn from a
transparent-sided ﬁberglass cow how milk
is naturally produced, or drink in some
milk facts at the Dairy Olympics, housed
in a giant milk carton. You can even try
your hand at squeezing some of a milk-
like substance (watch your aim, please!)
from the rubber udders of another fiber-
glass cow. Preschoolers will enjoy play-
ing dairy man in the Munchkin Milk
Factory, where they can sit in a miniature
milk truck or operate a dairy conveyer
belt.

If you haven’t had your ﬁll of milk

and cows after touring the barns, you
can get more milk kicks at the Dairy Store,
where ice cream and milk are sold along
with cow T-shirts, magnets, cow note-
cards, postcards and other mooomera-
ble gifts.

But don’t miss the rest of the zoo.
More than 4,000 animals exhibited
throughout 184 acres provide a day’s di-
version. View Alaskan brown bears, wol-
verines (of course—it’s the Wolverine
State) wolves, camels, rhinos, giraffes,
elephants, small mammals and primates.
Dolphins and sea lions perform in the
Surfin’ Safari program, while polar bears
play nearby. Sheep, reindeer, grizzly
bears and birds also call the Milwaukee
County Zoo home.

A Zoomobile and miniature-train ride
offer rest for the weary and an oppor-
tunity for a guided tour of the zoo.

Location: 10001 W Bluemound Rd.

THE SEXIEST

The Cincinnati Zoo
Cincinnati, Ohio

Nights can be cold in Cincinnati, and
even the zoo animals need to cuddle to-
gether to keep warm. That may be the
secret behind the large number of births
at the Cincinnati Zoo. The zoo boasts
world records for captive births of white
tigers (50) and black rhinos (13). Ac-
cording to Kim Hastings of the Interna-
tional Species Inventory Systems (ISIS),
an international organization that tracks
the births of 200 animals, it is next to
impossible to target which zoos have the
most births in captivity, however, be-
cause records are organized by species,
not zoos. In addition, she says, the re—
porting is somewhat vague, because some
zoos may list animals that died within
hours of birth, while others do not bother
to report those births. But the Cincinnati
Zoo has successfully bred more species
of rare big cats than any other, and it is
intensely involved in exotic-animal re—
productive technology. The zoo even has
a reproductive physiologist on staff, Dr.
Betsy L. Dresser, to supervise artificial
insemination and embryo transfers.

And then there’s always the teem-
ing population of Insect World to boost
the Cincinnati Zoo’s birth rate. Creepy,
crawly things swarm over every inch of
Insect World. See the inner workings of
a beehive, or watch a black-widow spider
spin its deadly trap. When you’ve thor-
oughly covered the inside of Insect World,
let the butterflies in the tropical walk-
through aviary set your heart aflutter.

Known for its outstanding success
in breeding lowland gorillas, the zoo has
created a comfy home for the big bruis-
ers in Gorilla World. Trees, rocks and
waterfalls form the natural habitat for the
gorilla families.

Bengal tigers, too, have let out their
ﬁrst baby roars at the 200. The Bengals
and white tigers can be found in Big Cat

THE GREATEST GORILLA VIEW

Woodland Park Zoo
Seattle, Washington

Woodland Park Zoo was so intent on
creating an authentic naturalistic gorilla
exhibit that it flew in a field scientist from
Africa, who had lived near wild gorillas
there for 15 years, to serve as a consul-
tant to the designers. When the exhibit
was finished, the apes found it so wide
open they decided to explore—and went
a little bit out of bounds. One especially
adventurous ape dragged a tree to the
back of the exhibit, ﬂung it up against
the wall in the moat and hoisted himself
out of the exhibit to freedom. Alarmed
visitors who spotted the gorilla on the
sidewalk rushed to the zoo director’s of-
ﬁce, where they were reassured that it
only seemed like the gorilla escaped—
all a part of the natural-environment con-
cept, you know. The director’s calm de-
meanor unraveled when he overheard the
zoo-goers comment on how it still didn’t
seem right for the gorilla to be sitting on
the sidewalk. The zoo closed, and the
gorilla, who couldn’t be coaxed back into
the exhibit via a wobbly ladder, was tran-
quilized and carried back home.

Even if you aren’t ready for a really
close gorilla encounter like that, you still
will enjoy the gorillas at the Woodland
Park Zoo. The zoo keeps close tabs on
the trees and the animals, and no other
great ape escapes have occurred in the
last seven years. The authentic rain-for-
est habitat, which has been called by some
200 experts the best in the world, is so
far removed from the traditional, neatly
mowed enclosure that staff members have
had to explain to visitors that the messy
look is desirable.

The half—dozen gorillas in the ex—
hibit usually stay in view of visitors. One
reason for this is that the apes need a
safe “flight distance” (the distance an
animal needs to retreat from an ap-
proaching creature in order to feel safe).
They like also to stay close to the hon]-
ders near the visitor’s viewing area, be-
cause hidden heating coils in the rocks
give off warmth in the winter.

Resist the temptation to stay all day

 

l
O

at the gorilla exhibit, though. You’ll want
to view the marsh, swamp and African—
savanna naturalistic exhibits, too. You’ll
see cranes, ducks, hippos, giraffes, ze-
bras, monkeys, bears, lions, leopards,
elk and mountain goats, among others.
There are more than 400 species of an-
imals at the park.

Location: At the corner of Fremont
Avenue North and Northeast 50th Street.

Information: (206) 789-7919.

 

THE INSIDE VIEW

Brookfield Zoo
Brookfield, Illinois

Rain or shine, you’ll enjoy a weather-
proof view of the great outside at Brook-
ﬁeld Zoo. Start with Tropic World, which
is as big as all outdoors, but still inside.
There you’ll be protected from the
weather, where thunderstorms rage
through the tropical rain forest, and only
the animals get wet. About the length of
one and a half football fields (more than
an acre), Tropic World is the world’s larg—
est indoor zoo exhibit. Take the pathway
overlooking pools and waterfalls to catch
a glimpse of some of the 100 primates,
40 birds and seven species of mammals.
Tropic World features three rain-forest
regions: South America, Asia and Af-
rica. Pygmy hippos, gorillas, monkeys
and anteaters snort and sniff through the
vegetation. Watch the trees for the mon—
keys grabbing their ﬁll of green plant foods
stuffed in a man-made beehive.

You’ll stay under cover in the Seven
Seas Panorama, where you can catch the
waves at the indoor dolphin show. The
original Seven Seas, built in 1961, was
the first inland exhibit of its kind in the
world. A 2,000-seat dolphinarium con-
tains interconnected pools holding more
than one million gallons of saltwater. Try
the deep-sea view at the dolphinarium’s
underwater-viewing gallery, or the Pa-
cific Northwest shoreline View outside,
where seals, sea lions and walruses
wander.

But not all the views are inside at
the Brookfield Zoo. Be sure to see the
Children’s Zoo, which contains domestic
animals and wildlife of North America,
the “Walkabout, ” in Australia House, and
a nocturnal exhibit of kiwi birds. More
than 2,000 animals inhabit the 204 acres
of park at the Brookfield Zoo.

Location: First Avenue and 315t
Street, 14 miles west of downtown Chicago. '

Information: (312) 485 0263.

THE MOST CAPITAL

National Zoological Park
Washington, D. C.

Even though it’s located in Washing—
ton, D.C., the “most capital” 200 is not
to be found in the Capitol Building or even
in the White House, but in the National
Zoological Park, which was established
by the US. Congress and is a part of the
Smithsonian Institution. Founded in 1889,

 

 

 

 




the zoo established a home for animals
given to the United States by Other gov-
ernments, usually as a goodwill gesture.
Before the Civil War, such donated ani-
mals had been allowed to roam freely on
the Mall, at two—mile promenade between
the Capitol and the Potomac. -

More recently the federal connec-
tion played a part in the 200’ 3 highly pub-
licizedgiftfromChinaoftwogiantpandas,
Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling. The pandas
were given to the AmeriCan people by
the People’s Republic of China following
a visit there in 1972 by President Richard
Nixon. The black-and-white pair are the
longest-living pandas outside of China.
The best tirne to admire these magnifi-
cent creatures is when they are fed their
vegetarian diet of bamboo, rice and-car-
rots twice daily. Their home is the Panda
House, where air-conditioning keeps
them comfortable in the muggy Washing-
ton summers.

After the panda exhibit, wander past
elephants, rhinos and seals to the Rep—
tile House. Behind the reptile house, you
can see lots of spineless creatures—oc-
topi, large crabs, microscopic organisms
(microscopes are provided for viewing),
large spiders and many more squishy
critters—at the Invertebrate Exhibit.
Here you can investigate the biology of
the oldest and most abundant forms of
life: Ninetymine percent of all animals on
earth are invertebrates.

A renovated Bird House, large bird
exhibit and tropical ﬂight room with 15
species of exotic birds offer free-flight
entertainment. Don’t miss the antics of
gibbons as they perform acrobatic feats
from fully grown trees inside their mesh-
covered enclosure.

Location: 3000 block of Connecticut
Avenue.

Information: (202) 673-4 71 7.

THE SWAMPIEST

Audubon Park and Zoological
Garden
New Orleans, Louisiana

Even if you haven’t the “boggiest”
idea about which creatures reside in a
swamp, you’ll enjoy looking for all kinds
of critters from the raised boardwalk of
the Louisiana Swamp Exhibit at the Au—
dubon Park Zoo.

Alligators, armadillos, black bears,
reptiles and other swamp-loving crea-
tures slosh about the exhibit. Keep an
eye out for the baby white alligators, found
by a ﬁsherman and brought to the park.
Partially albino, the little critters are only
about a foot and a half long and have white
bodies and dark eyes. Rare flowers, plants
and mosquitoes (arm yourself with bug
repellant) thrive in the soggy environ—
ment. For a diversion during your
swampwalk, settle back for some Cajun
food and music.

Ifyou haven’t seen enough slimy stuff
in the swamp, slither on over to the $2
million Reptile Encounter, opened last

 

 

year. Huge toads, lizards and Gila mon-
sters are on display. There are also 23

species of rattlesnakes to quiver over in
' the indoor exhibit.

Otheranimals to see include a white
tiger, white rhinos, clouded leopards, bald
eagles, elephants, wolves, Cheetahs,

5, sea lions and prairie dogs. You
can cuddle up to sheep and other do—
mestic animals in the petting zoo.

Location: 6500 Magazine St.

THE LARGEST IN A CITY

Bronx Zoo
Bronx, New York

More than 4, 000 animals hop, crawl
and roam across the 265 acres of the
largest zoo located within a city’s bound-
aries, the Bronx Zoo. Founded in 1895,
the zoo spans woods, streams and mead—
ows, providing a number of unusual ex-
hibits and trails.

Almost one acre in size, J ungleworld
is a fascinating indoor home for tropical
Asian wildlife. Tapirs, black leopards,
gibbons, giant monitor lizards and pro-
boscis monkeys play in the exotic envi-
ronment. From an elevated boardwalk,
you can marvel at the largest man-made
tree (with an eight-foot-diameter trunk).
Five waterfalls splash through the ex-
hibit; the highest is 40 feet. Tropical mists
and clouds swirl throughout.

Travel the trails of the Himalayan
Highlands, where you can see regal snow
leopards, red pandas and elegant cranes.
The Bengali Express monorail train tours
a two-mile track through the forests and
meadows of Asia. In this Wild Asia ex—
hibit, you’ll see elephants, rhinos, ante-
lope and Siberian tigers.

The New Children’s Zoo, opened in
1981, is a child’s paradise. Kids can
bounce inside a spring-mounted giant
heron’s nest, peek out of the burrows in
the child-sized prairie-dog town, climb
up a 20-foot rope spider’s web or hide in
a kid-sized snail shell. From the 14-foot-
high vantage point of the treetops, kids
learn about animals that live above the
ground, then duck through the hole in the
tree for a spiral slide to the bottom.

Other trails offer visitors a peek at
the dark world of bats and other noctur-
nal animals, as well as rare crocodiles,
giant tortoises, frogs and birds.

THE WETTEST

Washington Park Zoo
Portland, Oregon

From the splashing waterfalls of the
Cascades Mountain exhibit to the coast-
line exhibits of Alaskan polar bears and
Peruvian penguins, visitors to the Wash-
ington Park Zoo are doused with water
exhibits. Dip into this wet zoo at the Cas—
cade Mountains exhibit with a hike down

 

 

 

the quarter~mile nature trail that fea—
tures native trees, shrubs, flowers and
ground cover. You’ll wind up at the nat-
ural raVine and the Stream and Pond
Building. Inside, you really ought to see
the otters. Along with beavers, trout,
reptiles, amphibians and waterfowl, those
slippery critters thrive in an environ-
ment similar to that of the streams and
ponds of the Cascade Range.

The icy, wet grip of arctic cold sur-
rounds the polar~bear exhibit. Inside, you
can watch the bears frolicking under the
ice. Outside, see them lounge or enjoy
the chilly surf generated by the wave ma-
chine. Pull up your imaginary parka hood
in the Alaska Tundra exhibit, which de—
picts the rugged terrain of Alaska’s
northern slopes. Grizzly bears, wolves,
musk oxen and several smaller animals
ﬁnd a home in the harsh climate of the
tundra. Snowy owls blend into the white
powder and permafrost. Covering 1.75
acres, the exhibit features educational
electronic games, hands-on animal spec-
imens and spooky wolf-howl sound
effects.

For a warm-water splash, see the
Humboldt penguin exhibit. Sporting the
traditional black-and-white penguin coat
and a dash of colorful feathers sprouting
from the sides of their heads, these birds
are native to the rocky, warm coastline
of Peru; They create quite a show, splish-
splashing in simulated ocean currents
created by a wave machine and J acuzzis.

If you’re feeling a bit washed out from
all the water, however, creep over to the
summer insect zoo, or ogle the largest
and most successful breeding herd of
Asian elephants found in any zoo.

The 200 has wild animals, wilder tales

By BILL KACZOR
of The Associated Press

GULF BREEZE — Pat Quinn, not Gerald
McGrew. runs The 200 near this Florida Panhan-
dle city, and it doesn’t contain “a Gusset, a Gher—
kin, a Gasket” or even a single “Gootch from the
wilds of Nantasket.”

But even without the whimsical characters
from the mythical zoo of children’s writer Dr.
Seuss, The Zoo — one of the newest zoos in the
nation with a fourth birthday on May 19 — has
plenty to make people talk and gawk:

I Juergen Hergert, a West German reptile
expert, spent 100 days in a room full of poisonous
snakes two years ago. He came out unbitten but
bleary-eyed from sleepless nights in bed with
heat-seeking serpents.

I Ellie Phant, an 800-pound baby pachyderm,
last year was loaned to a pair of newlyweds who
wanted to arrive at their hotel with an extra
trunk.

I A feed-the-animals policy is in effect, as
long as visitors use only dry pellets sold by The
Zoo. The feeding are permitted at a petting area
and certain other exhibits, including a giraffe
tower where people can get an eyeball-to-eyeball
look at one of the long-necked creatures.

I Syria, a Bengal tiger, died last December
from a mysterious AIDS-like illness a day before
two cubs he fathered were born.

I Colossus, weighing at least 550 pounds and
billed as the largest lowland gorilla in captivity,
took his first steps into a spacious outdoor enclo-
sure March 18 after spending the last 20 years in
a small ind'oor cage at a now-defunct facility in
New Hampshire.

For Quinn, 51, The 200 has been the culmina-
tion of a dream not unlike that of author-

illustrator Theodor Seuss Geisel’s imaginative
Gerald McGrew.

“I always knew even when I was a child, I
always wanted to work with animals,” said
Quinn, who grew up in Knoxville and the nearby
hills of eastern Tennessee.

As a youngster he caught, raised and hunted
wild animals and continued his hobby as a sol-
dier in Korea, where he kept a menagerie that
included deer, hawks and eagles.

The nearest major zoo is in New Orleans, 200
miles away.

Quinn envisioned a simple, small and clean
zoo.

“What I’ve done is built a monster here,”
Quinn said with a smile.

It is neither simple nor small, with more than
250 animals covering 20 acres in the unincorpo-
rated community of Midway about 10 miles east
of Gulf Breeze. It is halfway between Pensacola
and Fort Walton Beach, which are 40 miles
apart. Another 30 acres are available for expan-
sion.

The Zoo includes several rare and endan-
gered species, including Colossus.

The Zoo has large outdoor enclosures, ponds
and monkey islands, a small indoor aviary, pet-
ting area, snack bar, gift shop and a new gorilla
complex that includes a two-story building.

Attendance has increased by 40 percent to 50
percent each year, and almost 107,000 people vis-
ited in 1987, making it the second most popular
man-made attraction in the western Panhandle
after the U.S. Naval Aviation Museum in Pensa-
cola, Quinn said.

The arrival of Colossus, purchased from Ben-
son’s by The Zoo’s New Hampshire partners,
helped double March attendance. Quinn expects
130,000 visitors this year.

record-breaking attempt at living with the *
poisonous reptiles two years ago. ‘

Quinn makes no apologies for the park’s am-
bitious name and bristles at the suggestion it is
unimaginative.

“The name, in fact, is quite imaginative
since this is the only 200 we’ve got,” he said.

qur children to meet a wide variety of
interesting animals face to face.

1 The purpose of the event, according
m the 200’ s Barbara Brady, is to bring
awareness of the Cincinnati Zoo and
Botanical Garden to Dayton and to
show Daytonians that the Cincinnati
Zoo is also Dayton’s Zoo, only 45 min-
utes away.

Animals, zoo keepers and volunteers
Mll be on hand from noon to 1 p. m.
tummy

Making an appearance will be an ele-
phant, camel, boa, owl, binturong, baby
goats, alpaca, cockatoo, walleroo and
others.

Proxmire and Alaska Republican
Sen. Ted Stevens ordered the GAO

North Alaska
found harmed
by oil projects

Pollution, destruction
greater than predicted

The New York Times

WASHINGTON - An unre-
leased preliminary report by offi-
cials of the Fish and Wildlife Ser-
vice" says oil development in
northern Alaska has caused far
more environmental damage than
the government predicted.

The report, the subject of dis-
pute within the agency, says devel-
opment of the Prudhoe Bay oil field
and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline has
been substantially greater than was
envisaged in the government‘s envi-
ronmental impact statements. pre-
pared before the projects began 16
years ago.

It concludes the projects have
created substantially more air and
water pollution and destroyed sig-
nificantly greater amounts of wild-
life habitat

Among its findings are that
11.000 acres of vegetation have been
lost to wildlife at Prudhoe Bay. al-
most double what was predicted,
and that most bird species have de-
clined in population, as have bears.
wolves and other predators.

The report cites inadequate
monitoring of environmental quality
and lax enforcement of environ-
mental laws regarding Alaska's.
North Slope. '

Lawmakers and environmental-
ists said Tuesday that the report.
prepared at the request of Rep.
George Miller (D-Calif.). could have
a signiﬁcant impact on the legisla-
tive debate over whether to open
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,
just east of Prudhoe Bay, to oil ex-
ploration. Environmentalists and
some officials favor protecting the
refuge as a pristine wilderness
area.

_ Some legislators also said the
report showed how environmental
impact statements, required under
the National Environmental Protec-
tion Act as a way to ensure that gov-
ernment activities are environmen-
tally sound, could seriously
underestimate the potentiai damage
of huge development projects.

Tongass Timber Boondoggle ?

Interpretations of Law
Cost Taxpayers Millions

 

by Christopher Horton

 

Adhering to a failing federal pro-
gram allegedly aimed at boosting
timber revenues and protecting jobs
in Southeast Alaska, the US Forest
Service spent more than $130 mil-
lion over six years for timber sales
that never took place. according to a
report issued by the General Ac-
counting Office, an investigative
agency under control of Congress.

Despite the collapse of the timber
industry, whose employment was
halved from 2700 jobs in 1980 to
about 1400 jobs in 1986, the Forest
Service stuck to the letter of a
federal law and “spent millions of
dollars to prepare and offer much
more timber than it could sell,"
according to the GAO report. The
annual allocation of $40 to $50 mil-
lion for Tongass timber-sale work
was spent for “logging roads to
nowhere” and facilities for USFS
workers, according to the report.

Furthermore, the report charges

that timber managers in the Ton-
gass National Forest lost $163 mil-

lion selling premium Sitka spruce
and cedar logs at cut-rate prices

from 1981 through 1985. Tongass
timber managers sold some of the
Sitka spruce and cedar logs to Asian
countries for as little as $2 each,
while in Washington and Oregon the
same logs sell for as much as 200
times that amount.

The GAO report blames the over—
spending on a provision in the Alas-
ka National Interest Lands Act of
1980 (ANILCA). Known as "Section
705," the provision enabled the For-
est Service to prepare 450 million
board feet a year even when the
timber industry could absorb only
about half that amount. As a result,
according to the GAO, the Forest
Service offered nearly twice the
timber volume needed by the indus-

try.

ANLICA was assed in part to
preserve jobs in outheast Alaska’s
timber industry, but by 1986 private
timber employment had dropped by
half of what it was in 1980. Agency
critics say that while the Forest
Service was spending millions on its
own facilities, employees and unne-
cessary logging roads, Southeast’s
timber economy was folding.

"The majority of the figures are
accurate,” said Wayne Nicolls of the

Forest Service in Juneau, referring
to a critical Seattle newspaper arti-
cle regarding the findings of the
GAO, “but the manner to which
they’re referred isn’t. Throughout
the report [GAO] the problems of
the law are indicated. ANILCA
didn’t guarantee profitability. The
timber program isn‘t profitable."

Indeed, during 1986, the year for
which GAO analyzed revenues and
costs, the Tongass timber-sale ro-
gram spent $47.9 million yet too in
only $3.3 million, a net difference of
$44.6 million.

“The law needs to be changed to
give the Forest Service flexibility,”
said Nicolls. When asked whether
the Forest Service was required
unequivocally to produce 450 million
board feet a year, Mr. Nicolls de-
clared that “the law needs to be
changed to give the Forest Service
flexibility. We've gotten some flexi-
bility since the law was enacted—
but we didn't always. The law says
‘you must, you must.’ "

The correct interpretation of the
law still seems to be at large. While
critics allege that the Forest Service
was profligate and indiscretionary,
the Forest Service claims that its
responsibility was “to make timber
availableﬁ' which it did to the tune of
$130 million in losses between 1981
and 1986.

“The Forest Service chose the
least flexible way to interpret the
law," said Steve Kallick, an attorney
in Washington, D.C., for Southeast
Alaska Conservation Council
(SEACC). “The GAO was kind to
them. What happened [spending]
could have been interpreted differ-
ently. They took whatever position
suited them."

Alaska Fisherman's JOURNAL, May 1988

“We were to decide on public land
allocation,” said Nicolls of the For-
est Service, refuting the charge that
one aim of ANILCA was to produce
revenue for the timber industry.

“When pressed by critics they
changed their interpretation twice
since 1985," said Kallick over the
phone during the week the report
was released. “They’re on their
third interpretation now. Our or-
ganization thinks it's partly the
law’s fault and partly the Forest
Service’s fault. They keep blaming
the law, but they had a lot of
discretion to interpret it. The
spending was criminal and their
budget is still as big as it ever was.”

Both parties do agree that the
intention of ANILCA wasn’t to pro-
duce timber revenues. “The ulti-
mate intention of ANILCA was for
jobs," said Kallick. In response to
the charges that it continued spend-
ing while ignoring the declining
state of the timber industry, the
Forest Service points to the reduc-
tion of their work force in Southeast
by 30 precent, and the maintenance
of 2,300 jobs.

Expenses for Forest Service facil-
ities have been denounced by critics
as “irrational.” The Thorne Bay
Ranger District complex in Prince of
Wales Island, which included an
employee ballfield covered with sod
from Seattle, cost $6.4 million. The
Corner Bay Work Center on Chicha-
gof Island cost $940,000.

An outspoken critic of the Ton-
gass program is Sen. William Pro-
xmire, D~Wis., who told the Seattle
Post Intelligencer that “even as a
jobs program, the Tongass [timber]
program was a miserable failure.
The GAO report confirms my view

DALLAS MORNING NEWS - April 30, 1988

cid rain hits home for prof

George Craw-
ford didn’t need
to pick up his
newspaper and
read about this
week’s summit
meeting be-
tween President
Reagan and
Canadian Prime
Minister Brian
Mulroney to know acid rain should
be taken more seriously. He already
had come to that conclusion by look-
ing at the rain buckets in his back
yard.

Mr. Crawford, a physics professor
at Southern Methodist University,
has been carefully measuring the
acidity of rainfalls in his Lake High-
lands neighborhood for three years.
And what he has discovered is that
acid rain no longer is just a problem
hurting southeastern Canada and
New England. It also poses a threat to
Dallas.

Although rain naturally is some-
what acidic, it becomes substantially
more so when it mixes with airborne
pollutants released from coal-burn-
ing power plants and vehicles. Over
time, highly acidic rainfalls can kill
fish and other aquatic life in lakes
and streams, destroy forests and per-
haps even harm human health.

When Mr. Crawford began his ex.
periment in 1985, 64 of 84 rainfalls —
or 76 percent — were more acidic
than naturally could be expected.
Three were extremely acidic. By last
year, the problem had grown far
worse: Ninety-six of the 103 rainfalls
in 1987 — or 93 percent - were more
acidic than normal. And a dozen of
those were highly potent — roughly
100 times more acidic than naturally
found.

The professor also noted which di-
, rection the air was moving during
» those storms and correlated the in-
formation with the acidity of the
rainfalls. From that, he was able to

 

conclude that the rains tended to be
the most acidic when the wind was
blowing up from Houston and across
a region of East Texas where several
coal-burning and lignite-fired power
plants are located.

As Mr. Crawford explained his
study the other day in his office at
SMU, it was obvious the professor had
been meticulous about his work. He
argued that because his experiment
had been far more elaborate than
those conducted by the Texas Air
Control Board and others, his conclu-
sions more likely reflected the true
gravity of the problem.

Based on his findings, Mr. Craw-.

ford believes the rainfalls in Dallas
are now as acidic as those that have
wreaked damage in southeastern
Canada and the northeastern United
States. And unless something is done,
he says, the environmental damage
and health threats that those areas
are experiencing will plague this
community as well.

Indeed, the professor thinks Dal-
las already may have begun feeling
the fallout from acid rain: Plants and
ﬂowers that prefer alkaline soil are
giving way to plants and ﬂowers that
do well in a more acidic base. And
even human health may have been
affected, as acid-forming molecules
in the air aggravate people’s allergies
and respiratory problems.

Mr. Crawford admits years may
have to pass before the damage from
acid rain is as severe in Dallas as it
now is in Canada and New England.
But that shouldn’t be used as an

excuse to procrastinate. Why wait un-
til disaster strikes? If the federal gov-

ernment were to act this year to curb
the emissions that create acid rain,
this area could avoid the dying lakes
and trees now blighting faraway
landscapes.

I can’t confirm each of the profes-

sor’s findings. I don’t presume to be a
scientist. But I do know we need

more people like Mr. Crawford giving

us the local angle on acid rain. Ide
ally, we ought to have someone like
him in every community of this
country. Maybe then, more Ameri-
cans would realize acid rain isn’t
merely a point of contention between
the United States and its northern
neighbor. It’s a down-home issue, too.

When Prime Minister Mulroney
appealed Wednesday to the Reagan
administration and Congress to make
a stronger commitment to getting rid
of the pollutants that cause acid rain,
all Americans should have been
cheering him on — not simply be-
cause such action would improve
U.S.-Canadian relations but mainly

. because it would improve their own

environment.

“One of President Reagan’s big
lies is that we don’t know enough yet
about acid rain to justify the cost of
prevention,” Mr. Crawford said. “The
fact is we knew enough when the
president came into office. We don’t
need to spend any more money on
acid rain research. If we’re going to
spend money, let’s do it to clean up
the air.”

Just how many more buckets of
rainwater will the professor need to
collect before the lawmakers in
Washington finally figure that out
for themselves?

Honorable Pat Swindall
Members of Congress

Gentlemen:

Three enclosures for you to read and ponder upon- nothing new in
any of them - simply reiterating what has been said by conserva-
tionists for years.

First — the story on Acid rain. Ihave written you re this, and
our government certainly should not be spending another $5 mil-
lion dollars to study the effect of acid rain on our streams,
rivers, forests, etc. 'We are not only despoiling and killing
our own natural resources, we are doing the same thing to Canada,
and there is no way Reagan can deny it and have any intelligent
human believe him.

Second - the Tongass Timber Boondoggle. This is another thing
which has been going on for decades. I understand from.prior
reading, that this timber has all been sold to Japan at ridicu-
lously low prices. Why are we now despoiling, or continue to do
so, the magnificent beauty of our wild lands in Alaska?

Then be sure to read - ”North Alaska Found Harmed by Oil Projects”.
This is something concerned individuals and conservationists have
known and claimed all along, so it is interesting to read that the

_ government is finally owning up to it. This should cause great
concern about opening the Refuges in Alaska to any drilling for oil.
If a go-ahead has been given on this, then I hope Congress will be
intelligent and concerned enough to see that it is stopped.

I swould like to hear from all three of you on all of these matters.
They are of great concern to me, and I am.sure to millions of Ameri-
cans.

Sincerely,

\ Major oil spill in California endangering

wildlife habitats, sports-ﬁshing industry

The Associated Press

MARTINEZ, Calif. -— The accidental

release of at least 175,000 gallons of a

particularly gooey form of crude oil has
turned from a minor inconvenience into a
major menace to fragile bird rookeries and
a major sports-ﬁshing industry.

“This is a sin, a crime against God’s
creation, and makes a city boy want to
cry,” said Joseph Hallachi, 43, of Santa
Cruz, who drove 120 miles to help state
crews remove oil from a city-park shore-
line.

The April 23 spill already has killed 200
birds and small animals and left 250 others
suffering ill effects.

The spill of San Joaquin crude from
Shell Oil Co.’s major northern California
reﬁnery oCcurred after a broken storm-
drain pipe running through the middle of
an oil tank allowed crude to be siphoned
out. The company’s practice of keeping
valves open during storms was a violation
of federal environmental regulations.

It has been a frustrating week for dozens
of volunteers trying to care for dying
wildlife and for cleanup workers struggling
to remove the tarry muck.

They have been busy along a lS-mile
stretch of waterway from the Carquinez

Strait to the mouth of the Sacramento-San
Joaquin delta, with their major sport-ﬁsh-
ing industry, and; at Peyton Slough marsh
and Ryer Island, a critical wildlife habitat
for the endangered clapper rail and dozens
of other bird species, including various

ducks, blu'e herons, black rails and

California brown pelicans.

“This is; the worst possible thing that
can happy to a pretty place like this,” said
Sheri Banks, a member of the California
Conservation Corps, a state job-skills
training program, who helped clean up.

“It’ll never be the same. I don’t think a
man’s hands can clean all this up,” added
fellow corps member Steven Reed, 19.

Those sentiments are echoed by Marti-
nez residents; by state officials, who blasted
Shell for violating federal regulations; and
by environmentalists, who fear for the
future of California’s dwindling wetlands,
where many shore and water creatures
breed and reproduce.

“There’s a lot of dismay by almost
everybody who lives here,” said Jack
Garner, city manager of Martinez.

Except for Shell’s administration build-
iiig, loading dock and wharf, the LOGO-acre
reﬁnery is outside the city limits, and thus
beyond city regulation.

At a state hearing Friday, Garner said,

“There’ll be an awful lot ’of anger, an awful

lot of frustration and an awful lot of
anxiety about our future in the company’s
shadow.” ,

Local boat Owners, many of Whom make
a living by taking Sports ﬁshermen into the
delta, fear the oil will harm the estuary’s
delicate food chain and possibly deplete
ﬁsh stocks already reduced by decades of
water-quality problems.

Most of the 400 boats at the city’s
marina still had oil on their hulls this
weekend; under federal regulations, they
can’t leave docks until they are cleaned.
Shell has promised to pick up the tab.

Harbor Master Barry Wysling closed the
marina until all oil sheens are removed.
That has prevented dozens of ocean
ﬁshermen from participating in today’s
opening of the salmon season.

Environmentalists are concerned about
the elTects of oil in the marshes.

“The marshes are devastated and
there are toxins in that oil that is seeping
into the environment every day,” said
biologist Neal Welsh.

Shell spokesman Bill Sharkey said the
company will “pay whatever ‘it costs” to
restore the damaged marshes.

 




TAMPA TRIBUNE - May 7, 1988

By STEVE NEWBORN
Tribune Staff Writer

LAKELAND - State game and fish managers
picked 28 lakes, rivers and swamps Friday as sites for
Florida’s first legal alligator-hunting season since 1962.
Eight of the lakes dot the state from Newnans Lake
near Gainesville to Lake Okeechobee.

The list was approved at a meeting of the Florida
Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission in Tallahas-
see. The hunt is scheduled for September, with 100 to
200 hunters expected.

The hunt is the first step in a gradual process of
opening much of Florida’s swamps and lakes to hunt-
ers, a game commission official said.

“This is in line with our intent to try to go slow and
easy,” said Dennis David, the commission’s alligator
program coordinator. “We’ll crawl before we walk.”

“If everything goes well this will grow throughout
the state,” David said. “We certainly envision this on a
broader scope, but not necessarily the entire state.”

Biologists now estimate 1 million to 6 million alliga-
tors live across the state.

The hunt originally was to include most of the state.
In January, after lobbying by environmentalists, the
commission decided to drop its plan to designate hunt-
ing areas by counties and instead limit the hunt to
individual water bodies and swamps.

Among the 28 approved sites are Lakes Hancock

areas during the September hunt.

In June, game commission officials will travel to
each site to conduct a snout count to determine many
alligators live in each area. Drawing from those fig-

Applications for potential hunters will not be avail-
able until mid-June, and will be obtained through the
commission’s regional offices. The hunt is open to any-
one over age 18 who has not been convicted of poach-
ing.

Mandatory training and orientation classes will fa-

each lake.

Alligator hunting was banned in Florida in 1962,
when their numbers were greatly depleted due to ex-
cessive hunting. ,

The species received national protection in 1973
with the passage of the nation’s first endangered spe-
cies act. Their status was upgraded from endangered to
threatened in Florida in 1977, and the first of several

THE LOSS OF

Counselors are helping
owners deal with pain

By James D. Smith
Staﬂ Writer

On a cold, rainy December night a little more
than a year ago, one of Holly MacKinnon’s best
friends was killed by a hit-and-run driver in Stone
Mountain.

“I went crazy for 24 hours, just screaming and
crying and carrying on,” she said. “I think it hit me
hard because I had just lost my father, I was in the
process of losing my husband. And I just wondered.
‘Why me, God? ” ' ’

That Mrs. MacKinnon’s friend was a catthe
faithful and affectionate Morris,made little differ-
ence in the depth of the emotional shock she suf-
fered. especially coming as it did on top of her fa-
ther's death and the breakup of her marriage, said
counselor Pat Hicks, who conducts bereavement
support groups in metro Atlanta.

“The loss or potential loss of a pet can be devas-
tating,” she said. “For many people, the ﬁrst step is
having someone to talk to. They need to be able to
let it all out. I let them know that I’m sympathetic to
their feelings and I listen."

Because people are less likely to talk openly
about their feelings when a pet dies, the death of
an animal friend sometimes can be as tgaumatic as
the loss of a family member, she said.

Her voice trembling as she spoke, Mrs. MacKin-
non said she is still unable to talk about Morris’
death “without totally choking up."*But she said at-
tending the support group sessions has been good.
“I think all the members of the group feel it really
is a help to talk about it.”

For airline stewardess Norlinda Philbeck, the
shock was overwhelming when two pet ferrets —
weasel-like mammals she described as “the Houdi-
nis of the animal world” —— drowned in a tub par-
tially ﬁlled with water in her N orcross home.

“I felt guilt that I hadn’t been able to anticipate
that. It was something I had to work through,” Miss
Philbeck said of the accident that occurred after
she let Widget and Augie out for a romp upon her
return home from a ﬂight. Though she later came to
accept the fact that there was no way for her to

have prevented the accident —- un-t
known to her, water had collected
in the tub while she had been away'
—— the shock of her pets’ sudden:
death was so great that she became
physically ill.

“I was hysterical. I started gag-
ging. I don’t know how I got them to
the vet that night,” she said. The
veterinarian conﬁrmed that nothing
could be done, and she later took
“her girls” to North Carolina for
burial in the pet cemetery at her
mother’s house.

Although pet bereavement coun-
seling is a relatively new effort in
Atlanta, it has existed for more than
a decade at the Veterinary Hospital
of the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia.

“It all started here." said Kath-
leen Dunn, a psychiatric social
worker who has been counseling as
many as 25 people a week for the
past four years at the university fa-
cility, which handles about 25,000
cases a year in its 17 veterinary
clinics.

For Mrs. Dunn, a typical day
may include trying to calm a hyster-
ical pet owner in the emergency
room or offering advice to an owner
who has just learned his pet has
cancer — and not long to live.
Sometimes, it gets sticky.

“We have people who are sui-
cidal," Mrs. Dunn said. “They’ll say
they don’t want to live if their pet
isn’t going to live. They need to talk
with someone who understands.”

In her practice, Ms. Hicks usual-
ly encounters people in calmer cir-
cumstances. For most of them. the
biggest obstacle is coming to terms
with how they feel and expressing
themselves. “A lot of people are
scared or they feel embarrassed to
say something,” she said.

They also may be reticent about
bidding their pet farewell — with a
funeral or some other ceremony —
but such a ritual is an important
part of the grieving process, Ms.
Hicks said.

Some parents, though able to
deal with the loss of a pet on their
own, are not quite sure how they
should go about discussing the
death of a pet with a child.

“Often, a pet is the first kind of
death experience a child can relate
to.” Ms. Hicks said. “The key is if
the parents can have open commu-
nication. They need to let the child
know it’s OK to talk about how they
feel and that this is a natural
process.”

In doing so, a pet’s death can be

a “beautiful opportunity” for par-
ents to help their children learn
how to deal with loss. Ms. Hicks
said.

An immediate quandary many
people face is what to do about re-
placing the pet they have lost.

“Some people think that all you

have to do is go out and buy a new
pet,” she said. “For one person,
that might work. But for someone
else. it could be the worst thing to
do."

Sometimes. however, the coun-
selor’s role can be to let pet owners
know they’re not being disloyal if

they do get a replacement. said Lin-
da Ehler, 3 Sandy Springs family
counselor who also works with peo-
ple grieving the loss of pets. "It's a
very individual thing. You can‘t just
say ‘don’t go out and get a new pet.‘
But some people won't let them-
selves do it. So, I give them permis-
sion to go out and get a new pet."
she said.

While many people hesitate to
discuss their pets' deaths with their
veterinarians. viewing the doctors
as people who deal only with medi-
cal matters. Ms. Ehler encourages
pet owners to talk with their vets
about their feelings. Having more
than one pet can provide a conven-
ient excuse for some people to re—
turn to the vet and discuss a pet‘s
death, she said.

For veterinarians. an under—
standing of pet owners’ feelings is
an important part of their overall
bedside manner. said Dr. Sharon
Crowell-Davis. assistant professor
at the University of Georgia College
of Veterinary Medicine in Athens.
While the subject of pet bereave-
ment isn’t offered as a veterinary
school course, it is touched on in
several classes, she said.

“Vets are usually very sympa-
thetic,” she said. “They know how
attached people can become to
their pets. They know how painful a
death can be."

hat we have here is a pig.

A friendly pig. A tidy pig. A pig of
cheerful demeanor. A pig in every way
pleasing.

But a pig nonetheless.

Pigs, as you know, are beasts of barnyards and
wallows. But this pig, Milo by name, lives in urban
comfort in north Scottsdale where his owner, Deborah
La Tempa, may often be heard to say to him:

“Hey, fat boy, come here.”

Milo is a pet pig, a pet Chinese (some say
Vietnamese) potbellied pig.

Milo also is as ugly as the day is long, even for a pig.
He has squinty little pig eyes and a wrinkled little pig
face and stumpy little pig legs and a great droopy pig
belly.

But little Milo is a thing of beauty to La Tempa,
who received the pig — and a fur coat — last
Christmas as a gift from her husband, Vic, who heard
about potbellied pigs on the radio one day.

“He came home and said, ‘I heard about a great
Christmas present for you, but I think I’d better tell
you about. it first.’ ”

The upshot of that conversation was that the La
Tempas chartered a plane to California — no
commercial airlines accept pigs —— and flew home with
Milo.

Milo —- “He just seemed like a Milo,” La Tempa
says -— came to Scottsdale as an infant, pig, just the
right size to hold in your hand. Now Milo is 7 months
old and weighs about 65 pounds. He is a pig of some
bulk.

“Essentially,” La Tempa says, “anything that is
edible he will eat.”

“He’s on a diet now,” she says. “I had him on 1%
cups of low-protein horse chow a day, and now he’s
down to half a cup, but he is still gaining weight.”

It might be the cookies. Milo is very fond of cookies.
Indeed, Milo is a pig of simple pleasures — cookies,
; dog food, horse food, stomach scratching. Scratch his
' stomach and Milo rolls over on his fat pig side and
closes his little pig eyes and makes little pig sounds of
dehght

He enjoys the company of La Tempa’s two children,
especially 3-year-old Bianca, who knows where the
cookies are kept. Milo often camps beside the
highchair of 17-month-old Sebastian, whose accuracy
with spoon and fork the pig finds pleasing.

Milo can bark like a dog.

I have acceptedhim. In fact, when the mood seizes him,

“He loves the cocker spaniel. He gets along with the
other dogs, but the cocker spaniel he loves,” La Tempa
says. “He actually sleeps in the kids’ playhouse. He
and the cocker spaniel snuggle up in there.” .

He is fond of swimming and riding in the car and of

flowers and mud. La 'I‘empa's
flower beds are bare and muddy.
Milo ate the flowers one day. It was
a day of swine and roses.

I’igs, as you may know, are.
clever. Milo comes when he is
called. Milo can open the screen
door and can knock on the arcadia
door when he wants to go out. Milo
is housebroken. Milo, in short, is a
'prince of a pig.

llut none of this answers the
crucial question: Why a pet pig?

“I’ve. always owned animals,"

says La 'l’empa, who also owns
three horses, none. of whom share
her enthusiasm for Milo. “I’ve had
coyotes and timber Wolves. I
worked for an animal trainer in

'Santa Ilarhara, and he had sea lions

and chimpanzees and tigers."
But why a pig?

“I’ve just always liked unusual
animals."

Yes, yes, but why a pig?

"I don’t know,” l.a 'l'emjm says.
“He. just kind ofgrows on you."

E thought it was a kitten limping
across the dark road, possibly hit
by a passing car. Pulling over
quickly, he approached the animal as it
tried to scurry away.

But it wasn’t a kitten, and it hadn’t
been hit. It was a rat with an electrode in
its head.

He took it to the local Humane Society
and went home to call his friend Nadia
about the freak circumstance. An animal
lover, Nadia got the animal from the Hu-
mane Society and had the electrode re-
moved by a veterinarian.

The animal turned out to be an affec-
tionate pet, but she never found out how
it had gotten on the road. It had either
escaped from a experimentation labora-
tory or had been in transport from one to
another. The result, in any case, was that
Nadia decided to become a volunteer at
the New England Anti-Vivisection Society

(NEAVS) to help ﬁght against the inhu-.

mane use of animals.
Millions of animals are used for prod-
uct testing and medical research each

In high school, Mr. Van Valkenburg
decidedtobecomeavegetarian,butit
wasn’t until he read PcterSinger’s “Ani-
mal Liberation” that he broadened his
outlook on the animal rights movement.

“When I read [it]," he says, “it clariﬁed
my feelings about animal rights, and I
moved from an animal welfare perspec-
tive to one of animal
liberation. It clariﬁed
the corporate source of
suﬂering — that there
was a proﬁt made [by
animal abuse].”

Many others were
aﬁ‘ected by “Animal
Liberation” in the same
way.

The direction of the
movement shifted from
animal welfare to ani-
mal rights — the convic-
tion that animals not
only should be cared
for properly, but that
they have inherent
rights to a life without
exploitation by human
beings.

“I’m just as con-
cerned about the mice
and the rats that are
used in the labs or the
chickens [raised on fac-
tory farms for food] as I
am concerned about the whales. They’re
all equally important,” Van Valkenburg
says. ,

Oncelimitedtoasmallcadreofactiv-
ists, the animal rights movement is be-
coming larger and more diversiﬁed.

“Tremendous gains have been made in

the last ﬁve years,” Van Valkenburg says.
“A number of states have passed pound
; seizure laws [to keep pound animals from
' being sold to laboratories for experimen-
tation], and more and more people are
awareofthesuﬁeringofanimalsinlabo-
ratories from things like cosmetics test-

ing,andthey’remakingachoicenotto
purchase those [products] that are tested
on animals.”

Van Valkenburg recently organized a
group of 30 volunteers during World
Week for Laboratory Animals. Dressed in
huge bunny suits, the volunteers took to
the streets of Boston (with some “human
companions”) to hand out information
about laboratory animals.

One of the pamphlets they handed out
was a wallet-size “cruelty-free shopping
guide” which lists makers of health,

the Draize eye irritancy test, have bee
the targets of anti-vivisection groups
for years.

The LD-BO, which stands for Lethe
Dose 50%, is the amount of a substanc

mals within a speciﬁed time period.

In the Draize test, chemical mixture
and other substances are applied directl;
to the eyes of restrained rabbits, whos
sensitive eye tissues make the rssultin;
damage easy to observe.

Although alternative tests are avail
able - at least 19 - many manufacturer:
continue to use tests that blind and kil
laboratory animals every time a new line
of cosmetics is introduced or “improved."

While NEAVS focuses almost entirely
on anthvivisection, there are many other
animal rights groups, such as the Coali-
tion to End Animal Suﬁering (CEASE)
which covers the whole range of anima‘:
rights issues

Evelyn Kimber, a volunteer who has
worked closely with CEASE and other
groups for the last four years, is con-
cerned about the state of society, both for

humans and animals.

“There isn’t a person
who reads the newspa—
per who can’t see that
the world is in a very
serious situation.

“I see our attitude
toward nature and our
respect for all forms of
life and species and the
natural world as being
very closely aligned
with the way we treat
each other.”

Ms. Kimber works
closely with the public
in her work with var-
ious animal rights
groups. She organizes
demonstrations such as
the Great American
Meatout and World
Farm Animal Day.

Kimber also works
with the news media in
order to reach the pub-
lic in ways that will in-

terest people in animal rights.

“Public education really is of tremen-
dous value, because people Simply aren’t
aware of what’s happening,” she says
emphatically. .

Lion owner gets probation in mauling case

By David Sedeno
Associated Press

SAN ANTONIO —— A lion owner
was sentenced to 10 years’ proba-
tésn, fined $5,000 and ordered to
stay away from exotic animals and
children so he would never forget
it was his fault his animal mauled a
little girl, a judge said Wednesday.

A jury that took less than five
hours last week to convict Gary
Durkovitz of injury to a child took
more than 12 hours over a three-day
period to sentence him to probation
and assess the fine.

But state District Judge Ted Poe
of Houston then. imposed more re-
strictions, ordering Durkovitz to

jobs.

Durkovitz, 35, of Houston was
convicted last week of injury to a
child after his 350-pound pet lion,
named Samson, attacked 8-year-old
Roxanne Hernandez at the Texas
Flea Market on Oct. 10, 1987, in
Houston.

The trial was moved to San Anto-
nio from Houston on a change of
venue.

Poe said that he imposed the re-
strictions so that Durkovitz would
realize he was responsible for the
lion’s actions.

“It’s his fault that Roxanne Her-
nandez is going to bear the bite of a
lion for the rest of her life,” Poe
said. “Society needs to realize that
certain creatures don’t belong near
the city, near the public where they
can hurt little girls.

“It was Gary Durkovitz’s fault
and I wanted to make sure he never
forgot that,” Poe said.

Defense attorney Robert Scar-
dino said he was not surprised by
the restrictions, but said he would

 

appeal the guilty verdict.

“We’ll never let this case go and
I’m going to appeal the verdict and I
think we’ve got a good chance to re-
verse it and try it again,” he said.

Harris County Assistant District
Attorney Alice Brown had asked
the jury for the maximum punish-
ment of 10 years in prison and a
$5,000 fine, but said she was not dis-
appointed by the sentence.

She also said she was surprised
that more children were not in-
jured because Durkovitz took the
lion and other exotic snakes to flea
markets and other exhibits.

“This man had the lion at char-
ity functions . . . at a church where
he said he had it around children,”
Ms. Brown said. “It’s just incredible
to me that only one child got hurt.

Ms. Brown also said that she
hopes the case sends the message
that you’re not supposed to have
these type of wild animals in the
city.

Durkovitz was walking the lion

out of the flea market on a chain
leash when it attacked Roxanne as
she walked in front of the animal.

The lion tried to put the girl’s
head in its mouth and bit off part of
her skull cap, exposing part of the
child’s brain.

She has undergone reconstruc-
tive surgery and faces more opera-
tions.

The girl’s mother, Sonia Hernan-
dez, testified that Roxanne has to
wear a wig or cap in public and has
trouble concentrating.

The lion was shot as it was at-
tacking the girl.

Durkovitz, who testified that he
had taken every safety measure to
prevent an attack, still faces a civil '
lawsuit in the case.

He also has been jailed on “NO
charges of indecency with a child
and one charge of aggravated sex-
ual assault of a child.

Ms. Brown said those cases stem
from Durkovitz allegedly using the
lion and other exotic animals to at-
tract boys.

sophisticated cell-culture tech-

It further noted that UC Berke-

AVERY CLAY WATCHES SISTER ALICIA GET HER FACE PAINTED
At Humane Society Festival This Weekend To Support Shelter

Humane Society ’l’reparing

To Start Animal Shelter Proiecf ;

The DeKalb Humane Society
hopes soon to advertise for bids for
the construction of an animal shel-
ter.

A weekend festival held at the
organization’s Covington Highway
property helped raise money for
the operation of the shelter.

The society plans to build a _
$150,000 animal shelter facility,’

according to Elizabeth Marshall, a
member of the society’s board of
Erectors. Enough funds have been

collected by the society through a ’

wide variety of fund raising flea
markets, dog washings and other
events to build the shelter but not
to operate it.

Humane Society members have
been using “foster homes” to house
dogs and cats needing adoption,
according to Ms. Marshall.

When completed, the new shel-
ter will have a large pen for cats,
puppy cages, an isolation area, an
examining room, 18 dog pens and a
food storage area.

“We think we’ve got a building
that is going to be excellent for the
purpose,” she said.

Building an animal shelter is a A

bit different from erecting other
structures...a_c.§0.1:dillg. to M5. Mar-

shall. It must have adequate venti-
lation, an abundant water supply
and paint that can withstand the
moisture, she said.

Animals taken into the shelter
will be offered for adoption if they
are healthy enough, according to
Ms. Marshall. An adoption fee
asked by the society covers the cost
of basic immunizations for the ani
mals and spaying or neutering.

She is concerned that the public
know the difference between the
Humane Society and its adoption
programs and the DeKalb County
Animal Control unit.

“We don’t take strays,” she said.

_ And the Humane Society has no

authority or interest in enforcing
animal control laws.

 




THE TAMPA TREL’iJNE

A

 

 

 

 

Animal activist
ﬁgh ts for cause
24 hours a day

He is a clock wound too tightly.

For the first 20 minutes or so,
Raini Sequoya, all 5 feet, 5 inches of
him, sat bunched up in his chair
like an alarm clock at 6 am, eager
to start clanging, in this instance at
the first hint of media abuse.

It is not an uncommon reaction
among those who lead or espouse
causes. J ustifiably or not, they seem
to have a common bond in the be-
lief that the press is out to get them.
Sequoya is the worst. Then again he
is almost one of the more sensitive
persons I’ve ever met.

That’s why I spent a goodly por-
tion of the afternoon trying to find a
crack in his casing, an opening that
might let us peer into the inner
gears and workings of this fascinat-
ing person, who has opted to devote
his life to animal rights, and see
what makes him tick.

In the end I was disappointed.
I’ve got a few morsels to share with
you, but not the whole story. Maybe
some day.

Sequoya had come by to see me
to see if he could get some coverage
for the fifth annual World Day for
Laboratory Animals, which was last
week.

Sequoya is something of a fatal-
ist. He once told a reporter he ex-
pects his life to end when he is shot,
that he has made too many ene-
mies.

“To some people, like certain
county officials,” he says, “I’m a
monster.

“What they don’t like to accept
is that they are the ones who creat-
ed the monster. I am what I am be-
cause of what they do.”

He also is a dreamer, especially
on those days when he is drained
and wants no more of the world.
That’s when he pulls the heavy cur-
tains in his apartment, puts an op-
era on the stereo and escapes into
another, less stressful world.

‘,.,_'.‘1’.13_

. “ "Now I live in me mountains.
I’ve drifted up here with the
winds,” he quotes from a country
and western song.

“Anyone with a cause feels like
the clock is running out,” he Says.
“So I keep going faster and faster.
I’m talking about the clock that is in
your mind.

“The clocks on the walls in my
house are all set an hour and a half
fast. It’s like a security blanket for
me — in case an emergency comes
up on behalf of animal rights, I’ll
have the luxury of that extra time.

“It’s hard to explain. I know that
if I could set the clock in my mind
back 20 years, I’d do that.”

The one thing Sequoya does not
like to do is look back, especially at
himself.

His cloudy outlook may date
back 'to the day he was born and it
was raining and he got his name.
Part American Indian, he was

brought up by his grandparents in
New England after his father was
killed in World War II and his moth-
er disappeared shortly thereafter.
In 1971, he moved to Tampa with
his former wife.

A chain-smoker, he talks with a
clipped New England accent behind
a clOud of smoke. “You take the pot
shots and the arrows,” he says, “but
you have to keep a thick skin and
you can’t remain sensitive to what
people are saying. You have to re-
member that it is the cause that is
important and not yourself.

"My cause is animal rights, but I
want to say this. ’

'jThere are three segments of
life that are exploited, and that is
because all three of them are de-
fenseless.

“We exploit children. We exploit
the elderly and we exploit animals
— and-through brute force. The very
group's'who can’t protect themselves
are the ones we take advantage of.

“Sometimes I want to shout at
those who say we are a compassion-
ate and civilized society. That’s ludi-
crous. Look around you.

“You know, if every individual
got involved in a cause to make it
better for all human beings, we
would be a better society. At hast
we would be trying, striving toﬂm-
prove ourselves as a civilization
(rather) than isolating those who
are the most defenseless.

“Unfortunately we’ve come to
believe that we can accept it as long
as it isn’t happening to us. How do
you expect a child to look at you
and believe you when you try to
teach it respect, and at the same
time that child sees you treat four-
legged creatures with none?

“I had a county commissioner
come up to me one time and ask me
why I was involved ‘in something
like animal rights. I asked him what
causes he was involved in.”

Sequoya seems to roll from issue
to issue, whether it is over the use
of animals for experimentation,

\pound seizure or the way agency

workers treat animals.

Probably his most successful
campaign came eight years ago
when he managed to get rid of the
decompression chambers once used
to destroy animals at the County An-
imal Control Center and the County
Humane Society. Sequoya is
wrapped up in his cause. When you
do that it’s tough looking at anyone
else’s perspectives, but he tries. I
think on some issues involving the
use of animals in the laboratory, he
is terribly wrong.

At the same time, Sequoya and
other animal rights people have un-
covered real abuses in the treat-
ment of animals.

We need the Raini Sequoyas of
the world to keep the pressure on.
We need people with the motiva-
tion, zeal and even abrasiveness to
irritate politicians and insult those
who hide behind professional de-,'
grees and claim they don’t have to“
answer to mere mortals. , .

If they would just loosen up once ,
in a while.

CHICAGO TRIBUNE - April 26, 1988

 
   
   

Beneﬁts don’t justify animal research

the middle 1990s. Instead of examining these .

res, too many journalists echo the euphemisms
0 medical “beneﬁcence” that regard all laboratory
animals as sentinels in service to mankind,
nonmoral objects that are “sacriﬁced” daily to
feed the massive biomedical enterprise.

EVANSTON—A recent Bill Stokes article in
Sunday’s “Health matters” column carelessly
disregards the complexrty _of disease and health
care in this country, granting extraordinary .
historical and present credit to biomedical animal
research in determining the state of our nation s
health. ' .

The health of this nation and animal research is
an inequality. Look at the balance sheet
Independent publications by socrologists and
demographic statisticrans report that medical
measures have accounted for only 3.5 percent of
the dramatic decline in mortality rates in this

'country in the 20th Century, from 1900 to.l973.

Realizing that only a small fraction of animal
research accounts for the noble practice of
medicine, its technology and delivery system, the
actual percentage is far smaller. Socral programs
initiated since the third decade, the growth of
private and public employment benefits, better
sanitation and hygiene, higher educational levels
and “self-knowledge,” and more money in our
pockets have been the primary determinants of
our health.

The bottom line: 36 million Americans are
denied access to the most basic of medical care;
U.S. infant mortality rates stand 12th in the
international score card, trailing several Third

World countries; nearly 50 percent of all
Americans will be without medical insurance by

tradition and is a practical measure of ,a budding
scientist’s academic worth as Ph.D.s compete to
survive in a “publish or perish” profession. Fraud
is not uncommon and utilitarian thinking is
pervasive with scientists trading onre'lative
numbers of animal lives as if 20 million mammals
killed annually instead of 40 million demonstrates
a growing compassion for these helpless creatures.
Every significant public health ofﬁcral has called
for a drastic shift in our public health priorities ,
from one of cure to one of prevention. But who s

interested?

And where are these scientists who believe in the
tradition of animal research? Why aren’t they _
openly justifying their actions in public discussion
and debate? True, they are not trained as public
communicators or politicians, but neither is the
animal advocate. Personal moral convrction in the
truth of the matter is what drives the animal ‘
activist to action. The average screntist has too

much to lose.

Pog trained to bark at fir

 

By PHYLLIS WILLIAMS
Staﬂ Writer

Bob Wummer trained his dog to
bark in case of fire only as an ex-
peﬁhnent.

@owever, the experiment proba-
bly, saved Wummer’s life early on
Sunday when a fire started in his
home and his German shepherd,
Fuzzy Bear, came to the rescue.

".fHe’s a hero,” Wummer said.
“He’ll be eating steak for the rest of
hisdife.”

.' Fuzzy Bear earned the new steak
diet when he woke up his master
and warned him that the house was
on fire.

“He nudged me a few times and
barked,” said Wummer, who lives
in the 3500 block of Island Road

just north of Palm Beach Gardens.
“When I woke up, all I could see
was smoke. I looked at the mirror
and saw the flames. It was unbe—
lievable — I didn’t know what to
do.”

Wummer woke up his son, Rob-
ert Jr., a Palm Beach Gardens po-
lice officer, and the two put out the
fire before leaving their smoky
home.

Palm Beach County Fire-Rescue
arrived at 6:30 am. and completed
its investigation of the blaze at 6:55
a.m., a spokesman said.

An electrical problem near an
aquarium apparently caused the
fire.

“If he hadn’t woke me up, the
smoke would have got to me,” said
Wummer, who did not have smoke

e saves man

detectors in the home. “The house
was just engulfed in smoke.”

Wummer is the owner of U.S.
Dog Training and K-9 Security in
Lake Park, which used to train
Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Of-
fice canines.

Wummer trained 7-year-old
Fuzzy Bear to bark and warn him
in case of fire to prove it could he
done.

“I never expected him to have to

put it to use,” Wummer said.

caught up in the fascination of solvmg the problem of
spacing the shells’ bursts, see, that he couldn’t be both-
ered by details like where or on whom they were
bursting. But later, I ot to thinking, “Hey, wait a min-
ute! That story’s not unny, it’s awful.’

I am having exactly the same second thoughts as I
read about the new cancer-prone mouse, the first ge-
netically engineered life form granted a patent. Har-
vard scientists have jiggered thefenes of a mouse
strain to produce a mouse that y gets cancer, the
p being to help cancer research.

y first response was a mouse gag, something to do
with Mickey and Minnie. But on second thought, 1m
beginning to worry whether this isn’t Shaky at work
again, now in a white coat rather than a steel helmet.

There are no villains here, let me hasten to pomt

out. Shaky the fire direction officer wasn’t an inhuman
monster. He was a technician.

.He was sitting back in a tent behind a hill, working
With a lot of figures and slide rules to get so many
shells from these tick marks to travel the exact range
and direction to fall on that tick mark there. Matters
hke man’s inhumanity to man, the cruelty of war or
even the defense of the free world never entered his
mind. What he was doing was trying to get the num-
bers to come out right on this one specific problem
that was his job.

Technicians do that. They usually let somebody else
worry about any long-term or unintended results that
might spin off what they are doing. And the better they
areat err specialty, the more likely they are to have
total concentration on the immediate matter at hand.

Which is why the rest of us, even though we profit
from the good stuff those whines do, ought to keep a
wary eye on technicians, particularlv when the" are

fooling around with something explosive. When the
technicians are whipping up new life forms, they are
up to something that makes the invention of nuclear

warfare look like playing with firecrackers. In this .

mouse project, as in most other cases, everybodyis, of
course, full up and running over with good intentions.
The goal is to give a boost to research, thereby per-
haps to discover new cancer treatments, maybe even,
someday, a cure for cancer. _ .

Therefore, given that noble goal: Can anybody With
an iota of sympathy for cancer victims fail to cheer
the lifeform-designer team on at top speed? .

than anyhody I know. Thereport on my last checkup
said “technically in remission.” This means, “OK for
the time being.” The progress of research on cancer,
therefore, is no academic matter to me. Normally, I’m
for pressing on full Speed, with extra shifts when need-
ed

Nevertheless, looking now at our 3 ies’ new abili-

- ty to design a doomed mouse, I won er if we humans

are wise enough to do everything that we are smart
enough to do. We have created an enormous range of
woes for ourselves by the messes we have made of our
inanimate creations. The potential for fouling up when
we start devising critters that walk, crawl or fly is m-
finitely greater. . p

I note that when the first patent is granted, it’s not
for making a better mouse, but a cursed one. The new
customized mouse design isn’t able to leap tall build-
ings at a single bound, nor is it a devil with the ladies,
nor does it eat pollution and excrete super unleaded
gasoline. No, we design the poor little sucker so that
he’s got dibs on cancer when he’s born. With three
strikes on him before he even gets out of the dugout.

the new engineered mouse makes Joe Btfsplk, the
‘ Dogpatch Jonah, look like destiny’s darling.

I hate to be a pessimist, but mark my words, as the
laboratory Sha kies get higher up the mammal ladder,
we can expect more of the same. They won’t be turn-
ing out Albert Einsteins and Mother Teresas for the
218i century. They’ll be whipping up Charles Mansons
and Lavrenti Berias, in order, they’ll assure us, to fa-
cilitate much-needed research on human viciousness,‘
du licity and violence. :

t’s more, these tailonmade horrors will sooner
or later jump the experimental track set down for

them by the scientific Shaky and wind up in positions,

where they can do maximum damage to the rest of 118.
Before you know it, they’ll be running for the City
Council, getting elected attorney general or taking
over the Department of Transportation. Ordinary pol-
iticians, equipped with only normal, catch-as-catch-
can nastiness, won’t have a chance against the labora-
to -improved villains. .
he scientific law that guarantees this result? is
Murphy’s. Which is why, even though I usually urgemn
anything for cancer research, I think somebody needs
to do the forward observer’s bit. It is time to shoot,
“My God, 'let’s step and think about whether 38
what we want to do here!” ‘ . ”’11
And, in fact, Congress has a double handful of hills
up to call a moratorium on designing and deploying
new life forms until we figure out how or if we wantto
do that. Having written a hundred pieces blasting can;
gress for its dawdling at the switch, I have to admit.

coos at a black hound named Who
— one of her remaining best
friends.

The 76-year-old woman, who says
she never cries at funerals, has
been mourning the loss of her pets.
On Friday her eyes were bloodshot.

Mrs. Harbert’s other pets — stray
dogs named You, Roxi, Candy, Boy,
Go-Go, T.J. and AC. — were confis-
cated by the Richardson Animal
Shelter that morning because of
complaints that they chased joggers
and bikers.

Although they were well-tended,
the five puppies and three adult
dogs also needed vaccinations,
neutering and spaying. Mrs. Har-
bert supported eight dogs, five cats
and a rooster on her Social Security
income.

“I’ve decided I’ll just have two
dogs now,” she said. “Maybe I won’t
have to worry about them so much.
I have to sacrifice so that they can
eat.”

Mrs. Harbert found three of the
abandoned dogs near her frame
home, which is surrounded by golf
courses and wheat fields in far east
Richardson. One of the dogs later
had a litter.

After two warnings about vac-
cine ordinances, the shelter de-
cided to take most of the animals
from Mrs. Harbert.

Through the Collin County
Humane Society, the shelter’s offi-
cers hope to find homes for the pup-
pies. Anyone interested in adopting
a pet should call the shelter at 238-
0709.

Don Humphries, a Richardson
veterinarian, will donate care for
two of the dogs — Who and You -—
that Mrs. Harbert will keep.

Ollie Harbert, who has owned many dogs since she was 4
years old, said she prayed for the survival of her pets.

The Richardson shelter compro-
mised with Mrs. Harbert because
she had genuine concern for the
animals. Normally the pet owner
would be fined and the animals put
to sleep after a brief stay at the shel-
ter.

“It’s pretty humanitarian of her
to take in all those strays, but it
tends to cause disease problems if
they don’t have vaccines,” said
Mike Lester, animal control super-
visor. “There’s been a lot of cases of
rabies in skunks lately. That’s dan-
gerous for animals, especially in ru-
ral areas like this one.”

Lester said the fact that shelter
officials took the animals from Mrs.
Harbert would help her in the long
run.

“She said she’s on a limited in-
come. And the dogs should be eat-
ing her out of the house,” Lester
said. “There may even be other
stray dogs that come and go to her
house —— a nice little meal ticket.
We’re relieving her of a little bur-
den and taking care of health prob-
lems.”

Jennifer Golden, president of
the Collin County Humane Society,
praised Mrs. Harbert for caring for
the strays.

til you bring back You.

“She has no transportation. She’s
a senior citizen. She has to pay
someone to go buy dog food for
her,” Ms. Golden said.

“We have very well-educated,
financially OK people who won’t
put forth that effort for a stray ani-
mal,” she said.

Mrs. Harbert, who has owned
many dogs since she was 4 years
old, said she prayed for the survival
of her pets. “Animals have life,” she
said. “They don’t have souls, but
they have feelings. They depend on
us for food, and that’s the way God
intended it."

Sitting in the shade of peach and
persimmon trees, Mrs. Harbert
waves a photograph of former pets
and begins to reminisce.

One dog story leads to another.

“When I was little, I told my papa
I was going into the dog business,”
Mrs. Harbert said. “I can’t stand to
have a poor dog. They’ve got to be
plump. . . . ” Suddenly she remem-
bers her puppies in the pound. Mrs.
Harbert gets misty-eyed.

“I couldn’t stand for them to take
them all away at once,” she said. “I

Gentlemen:

I hOpe The Senate will overrule the voting of the dumb-
dumbs in the House who voted to open a Wildlife ”REFUGE”
to oil drilling. I don't understand the 17 for and 9
against. Is this the committee handling the Bill, and
will it now go to the Floor of the House for a vote by
all:members of the House? Please clarify for me.

In the meantime, as I said, I hope the Senate understands
what the word Refuge means. My dictionary says: Refuge—
a shelter or protection from danger or distress; an asylum.

Ever since the oil companies first asked for permission to
drill in this Refuge, I have been following the editorials
and LEtters to the Editors in about 25 newspapers around
the country. I work for an Ad Agency so have these papers
at my disposal. The only people and organizations who have
been.£QR_this drilling have been the oil companies, or oil
company employees, and they are certainly NOT THE MAJORITY
of Americans. I think if Congress asked its constituents
how they felt about this, the reply would be an overwhelm:
ing "NO DRILLING IN THE REFUGE!!!”

Please listen to the voice of the majority, and not the few
who would ruin a magnificent Refuge for something they are

not even sure of getting, and then there is the possibility
the results do not warrant ruining this unspoiled wilderness.

I would like to know hOW you gentlemen will vote on this
matter, and copy is going to Pat Swindall, and I am asking
how he has, or will vote on this Bill.

Limo Driver
Catering To A
Special Breed

By Tommy Robertson
Of the Post-Dispatch Stati

Andre Graham is an engaging 25-
year-old limousine driver with a
smooth manner and a ready laugh
he uses to deflect any questions he
cannot — or will not -— answer.

So when you ask him why an ap-
parently sensible young man is
driving around Clayton in a light
gray limousine with two poodles,
Camille and Della, in the back seat,
he laughs.

Last week, he guided the limou-
sine easily through the streets of
Clayton and recalled how he came
to be hired for one of the most un-
usual chaufieur’s jobs in the metro-

 

politan area —— squiring pets from
their homes to Kennelwood Village,
at Page and Lindbergh boulevards,
to be groomed or boarded.

He explained that he had worked
as a food-service driver for Ozark
Air Lines before its merger with
Trans World Airlines.

The merger occurred, and he
was one of the employees to be let
go when the airlines reorganized.

That was more than a year ago.

“I was just looking around for
something to do when I applied for
the job at the kennel," he said in
reference to his eventual employ-
ment at Kennelwood Village.

Graham was a custodian there
for about four months when the
management brought a new com-
pany vehicle onto the kennel’s
parking lot. ’

“I thought it was some rich per-
son bringing in their dog to be
groomed or boarded,” Graham
said. ' ’

“When I found out the car be-
longed to the kennel, I went to the
vice president and asked him what
he was going to do with it. When he
told me, I asked him if I-couid drive
it” ' .
Customers can call the kennel

 

Si

"they really love Andre. I don’t

know why,” said Bluestein, who re-
ported that Camille and Della are not
all that friendly with strangers. -

As for Graham, he just laughs all
the way to the limousine.

Graham. . . , .

_ .Alan Jones, vice president of Ken-
nelwood, is well aware of the appeal
of the limousine service and Graham.

“I don't know if the service would

, work as well if we didn’t have some-

one‘ as nice as Andre," he said.

‘ -‘ "And Graham is busy -- he makes

Jones says that his idea. of provid-

ing the limousine service has really
caught on with customers, and he at-
tributes; much of that success to
Graham. .~ 1 .

He said clients sometimes call and
ask specifically for Graham. It’s an
unnecessary request because Gra-
ham is the only driver of the kennel’s
only limousine.

But ask Graham why he is so popu-
lar, and you get that nervous laugh

again alOng with a shrug of the shoul-
ders. Oh, he’ll acknowledge that he
likes animals .well enough, but that
does not explain such things as the
reception he-got from Della and
‘Camille.

“They justtlove him,” said Jenny
Bluestein, as she stood inside the
front door of her home in Clayton and
watched her poodles go wild when
Graham appeared.

Bluestein, who operates a hair sa-
lon in Clayton, started taking her dogs
to Kennelwood when her favorite
groomer went to work at the kennel.

Graham and his limousine, it
turned out, were a bonus.

“Sometimes I'll have them picked
up at the shop," she said as Della and
Camille wondered what was holding
up their ride with Graham.

- “It causes a big stir when the lim-

ousine comes to pick them up. The
receptionist will get on the intercom
and page Della and Camille and tell
them their ride is here, and they
come running out." Bluestein said.

Rappers help revive t

By Andrew Stern
Reuters

CHICAGO — The raccoon hat,
immortalized by true-blue Ameri-
can heroes Daniel Boone and Davy

Crockett, is back and it’s cool this

time arbiind.

It wasn’t reruns of the 19503 tele-
vision show featuring frontiersmen
that revived the furry-tailed fad ei-
ther.

It was the Fat Boys, a group of
oversized rap musicians from
Brooklyn.

The coonskin craze is also part of
a trend of men ﬂocking to furs.
Some. furriers estimate that, al-
though men made up virtually none
of the fur market five years ago,
they ~are responsible for nearly a
tenth/0f today’s market. .

“The other day I had a white
mink coat with matching beret
made for a local minister,” said Chi-
cago furrier Arthur Himmel.

Fat Boy Damon Wimbley, known
as “K001 Rock,” picked up his rac-
coon hat at a novelty store during a
Canadian promotional tour and the
headgear of the rapid-fire singers
has since developed quite a follow-
mg.
“We took them on tour, and they

means good, he explained.

“In New York, you see white

izes us . . . gold chains and raccoon.

hats,” the 21-year-old rapper said.

Like some evolving fashion
trends, the hat with the tail appears
in the very rough or the very ritzy
neighborhoods of Chicago and New
York.

“They’re everywhere in my
neighborhood of Uptown,” said
Shawn McBride, manager of the
Chicago Fur Outlet. “But I wouldn’t
be caught in one, no way. I’Iﬁ an

 

adult. This is for lower-class kids
who rap.” '

Neither would Susan Russell, an
animal-rights activist with the
Friends of Animals. People who
wear fur hats complete with ani-
mals’ head and tail, she said, are
“wearing a bumper sticker of igno-
rance.”

“This is a moral obscenity that
somehow stuck with us, promoted
by a destructive corps of conspicu-
ous spenders,” Ms. Russell said of
the $2 billion-a-year American fur
industry.

furriers said.

“More and more men are becom-f,
ing more daring,” furrier Himmel
said.

Liberace, not everybody’s idea of
a man’s man, sparked male demahd
for furs, Himmel said, adding that
leather jackets with fur lining

fox are often seen around town. 1 “C

Designers such as Ralph Lauren,
Donna Karan and Calvin Klein may
not have included coonskin hats” in
their collections, but they have in;
troduced fur-accented clothing
lines.

Aspiring rappers can pay up to

$500 for a real coonskin cap, while a
fake fur variety can be had for $7.99
in some of Chicago’s seedier shops.

. A Daniel Boone hat of white rab-
bit sells for $65 at Bats in Your Bel-
fry, a hat store in a swanky part of
Chicago.

Another big fur seller among
men this year is a Russian troopers
hat with ear flaps that tie at the top.

In fact, men are increasingly in
the market for fur hats and coats,

 




LOS ANGELES TIMES - April 27, 1988

EDITORIAL :

Saving the Wild Horses

The loophole was big enough to drive a herd of
wild horses through. On the other side, too often
was the front door of a slaughterhouse. A few
lucky mustangs wound up as rodeo stock. The
unlucky ones were sold for meat.

The Times’ Ronald B. Taylor disclosed earlier
this year how ranchers were able take advantage
of the federal government’s wild-horse adoption
program to win title to thousands of horses without
paying the $125-a-head fee. The animals then
would be sold in violation of the spirit and letter of
the law, which prohibits economic exploitation of
the herds.

This month the U.S. Bureau of Land Manage-
ment wisely suspended the fee-waiver arrange-
ment and said it will work to increase individual
horse adoptions and study the development of
privately funded wild-horse sanctuaries in the
West.

What to do about the West’s estimated 43,000
wild horses is not an easy problem with any easy
solution. The roaming mustangs compete with
cattle and sheep on open grazing land leased by
ranchers from the Bureau of Land Management.
Such leases often have been in families for
decades, and in many areas leased federal land is
considered an integral part of a ranch. In the old
days, the wild horses routinely were shot or
rounded up and sold for pet food.

The Bureau of Land Management launched its.

adoption program several years after Congress
‘ protected wild horses—the offspring of domestic

horses that were set free over the years for one
reason or another—in the early 1970s. But in
recent years, only about a third of the best animals
have been adopted. The culls left over in BLM
corrals after the yearly roundups tend to be older,
wilder and the least attractive. The government
now spends about $17 million a year to feed them.

The mass fee-waiver program made sense only
if the probable ultimate fate of the horse was
ignored. Ranchers would feed the animals on their
own land, thus saving the federal government the
expense. Bureau officials claimed they did not
know what happened to the horses after the
one-year waiting period for a title. The probable
outcome should have been obvious, however.

Bureau of Land Management officials say the
range probably could support about 30,000 wild
horses without causing undue damage to the land.
The new program of promoting the individual
adopt-a-horse program in the East might help. So,
too, would donation of private land as sanctuaries.
Of course, something would have to be done to
keep the mustangs from straying back onto the
federal leased range, but fencing of such vast
expanses is prohibitive. But it also does not make
much sense for the BLM to be in the horse-ranch-
ing business, keeping unwanted mustangs confined
to corrals and fed at public expense.

' ‘ Credit Bureau of Land Management officials for

seeking creative solutions. But in the case of the
mass fee waivers, fault them for having their
Stetsons pulled down to the bridges of their noses.

MEMPHIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL -

Creatures of the sea

IN 1972, Congress passed legis-
lation aimed at the random killing
of dolphins by tuna-fishing fleets.
The law’has reduced dramatically
the slaughter by American boats,
but the kill still is high among for-
eign vessels.

Before the government
cracked down, as many as 500,000
dolphins died each year from
drowning or injury after becom-
ing trapped in huge seines used to
net tuna. The dolphins, which are
mammals that breathe air through
a blowhole, tend to travel with
schools of tuna in the eastern Paci-
fic Ocean.

The 1972 law put an annual
limit of 20,500 accidental dolphin
killings by American boats, and
last year the toll for these boats
was down to about 14,000. But for-

April 29 , 1988

eign vessels are estimated to be
killing around 100,000 a year. For-
eign fishermen either are less
careful than Americans or don’t
care how many dolphins die in
their nets.

Four years ago, Congress
amended the 1972 law to require
the US. government to press for-
eign tuna fleets to reduce the
slaughter. A recent Senate hearing
disclosed that the pressure obvi-
ously hasn’t been heavy enough.

One way to put additional heat
on the foreign operators is to deny
access to American markets for
their tuna catches. This sanction
should be applied to those who

LOS ANGELES TIMES - April 26, 1988

 

 

Marie Newberry, known as the Cat Lady of Lockheed, tends to cats in new feeding station at Lockheed's Burbank plant.

Postscript

 

‘l have to stick around here to make sure the cats get a fair shake.’

 

The dining area is small but tidy and
protected from the elements. The plates are
plastic and the milk is served in tuna cans. It’s
not exactly Chasen’s, but the diners were
chowing down as if it were not only the best
meal they had ever eaten, but possibly their
very last. Tails twitching, ears laid back
delicately on their feline heads, they were
methodically taking large mouthfuls of cat
kibble, then warily peering across the
Lockheed parking lot.

Marie Newberry, known as the Cat Lady of
Lockheed, watched the dinner party in the
dawn light. She looked pleased. “They’re
looking real healthy, aren’t they?" she asked,
admiring the feral cats’ thick fur and the new
cat feeding station built at the aerospace
firm’s Burbank plant.

The station, created after months of
negotiations between Lockheed officials and
animal rights volunteers, is considered an
innovative solution to the cat problem at the
plant. And if the pilot project works out well,
it will undoubtedly be a blueprint for other
companies that have similar animal problems,
animal rights officials said.

It was almost a year ago that Newberry was
fired from her sheet-metal job at the plant
because she refused to stop feeding the cats.

The animals, which for years had been
fixtures at the plant, lived in equipment sheds

and warehouses. The cats had kept the rodent
population down, but when they multiplied to
more than a hundred, officials hired a pest
control company to get rid of them. Lockheed
also demanded that N ewberry stop feeding
the cats, contending that they were a-health
and safety problem. Newberry, who for most
of her 35 years had risen daily at 2 am. to
make the cat feeding rounds before going to
her 7 am. job, refused. After repeated
warnings, she was fired.

After Newberry’s plight was chronicled in
The Times, there was an outpouring of public
sympathy. Actors and Others for Animals and
another animal activist group, C.A.T.S. (Cats
At The Studios), protested to company
officials. The International Assn. of

_ Machinists filed a formal grievance, and soon

Newberry was reinstated to her supervisory
job.

Now, after months of negotiations, a plan to
allow the cats to stay at the plant has been
worked out, with all parties pitching in to help
on the project. Lockheed officials built the
10-foot—long fenced and roofed run in which
food is placed. There are several wooden
enclosures in the feeding station so that the
animals can seek shelter in cold weather.
Outdoor carpeting and paneling to give the
cats more privacy will also be installed.

Newberry has continued to feed the cats,

using her own money for the $35-a-day bill.
C.A.T.S. volunteers have been trapping the
cats, paying to have them spayed and
neutered, and returning them to the plant.
(The nonprofit organization was started
several years ago by Elyse Mayberry, a movie
studio employee, to take care of the stray cats
at several local movie studios.)

The volunteers have also offered Lockheed
officials assistance in emergencies. The other
day, for example, C.A.T.S. volunteer Cristin
Allen crawled up on a warehouse roof to coax
down a stranded cat.

Allen says the group eventually hopes to
get aerospace workers to organize their own
chapter of C.A.T.S. at Lockheed, so the
feeding program can continue after
Newberry retires. Efforts are also under way
to raise money to help her feed the cats.
(Donations, earmarked for the Lockheed cats,
can be sent to C.A.T.S., P.O. Box 1883,
Burbank, 91507.)

But N ewberry is in no hurry to retire, even
though she is 69 years old. “I have to stick
around here to make sure the cats get a fair
shake,” she says, pouring milk into a can for
the dozen or so cats that had earlier
scampered up a ramp to the feeding station
after hearing her car arrive. “They won’t
come out for anyone else.” \

HOUSTON POST - April 28, 1988

Council
tells vets
to snitch

By Lou Jakovac
OF THE HOUSTON POST

In the dog-eat-dog world of
city finance, veterinarians in
Houston
new job — informant.

The City Council on
Wednesday required veterinar-
ians to report pet owners who
have their dogs and cats vacci—
nated for rabies. The city will
then cross-check the names,
ferreting out pet owners who
fail to pay licensing fees.

“What are they trying to do

— get an increase in vaccina-
tions to avoid a rabies out-
break or trying to increase rev-
enues?” he asked.

City officials say raising rev-

enues may be one aspect of
the new requirement, but they
contended the primary intent

is to have assurances that pets

are vaccinated annually and to

prove ownership of animals.
“It’s a matter .of protecting
their pets,” said Councilman

John Goodner, chairman of a

_committee that drafted the

mandatory rule.
“We have dogs running

through our city that offend ‘

the citizenship,” added Dr.
Robert Armstrong, chief of city
animal control.

However, veterinarians said
the mandatory reporting sys-
tem will likely cause a back-
lash: Owners will simply forgo

or travel outside city limits for

The HVMA initially argued
that the requirement violated
the group’s code of ethics. But
a state Attorney General’s
opinion, based on a similar

. in Dallas, said the re-
porting fell under the state Ra-
bies Control Act.

“To me, the issue is the ani-
mals who never see a veteri-
nanan -- they're the risk for a
rabies epidemic," said Dr. Ben
Tharp, a veterinarian in south-
west Houston.

The council initially ap-
proved the program in 1985,
but made it voluntary. Last
year, after hearing arguments
against mandatory reporting,
the voluntary system was ex-
tended.

On Wednesday, a unani-
mous council approved the

mandatory program without
discussion.

There is a lifetime $10 li-
cense fee for neutered pets
and a $10 annual fee for oth-
ers. Pet owners are fined an
additional $10 if they fail to
license their dog or cat within
30 days of receiving a city no-
tice.

Once in court, a guilty ver-
dict can bring a $200 fine for
failure to have a pet license. It
could cost a pet owner an ad-
ditional $200 fine if the animal
is not vaccinated.

Armstrong said 6 percent of
an estimated 750,000 dogs
and cats in Houston are li—
censed. The city expects to
earn about $400,000 from pet
licenses in the fiscal year end-
ing June 30, he said.

Armstrong said that last
year, veterinarians reported
vaccinating 145,000 animals,
but they refused to provide
names of the owners of about
100,000 of those pets.

“Many said their clients
were upset,” Armstrong said.

Under mandatory reporting,
“We would be ecstatic to get
-25 percent” of animals in the
city licensed. in Dallas, where
licenses cost $15, about 16
percent of an estimated
434,000 animals are licensed,
he said.

CRESTWOOD

Animal Law
Revision Is
Postponed

By Raymond w. Vodicka
0f the Post-Dispatch Staff

Crestwood aldermen have de-
layed action on a proposal to re-

, vise the city ordinance regulat-

ing dangerous animals.

.The proposal is designed to
give the city better control of
such animals as pit bulldogs. It
would also create a dangerous
animal bmrd which would hear
appeals by owners of a city rul-

‘Eingv that theypossess dangerous

animals.

After a lengthy discussion by
aldermen at their meeting Tues-
day, Mayor Patricia Killoren
suggested that action be delayed
until the next meeting. Mean-
while, aldermen could put possi-
ble amendments in writing, she
said.

On other matters, aldermen
returned to the Planning and
Zoning Commission a request
that the city grant permission
for building three houses in the
9500 block of Garver Road. The
action came after Midwest Con-
struction and Development Co.,
the developer, made changes in
its proposal.

Midwest proposed to build
three houses costing as much as
$200,000 each on the two-acre
tract. The company had pro-
posed to end Banion Court in a

cul de sac. It changed its propos-
al to make Banion Court a

.,
tl‘af'pugh street to Garber Road. .
ﬁrs company’s request also was
opfidsed by Ted Luepke, a member of
the Planning and Zoning Commission
who lives near the tract.
City Attorney Shulamith Simon rec.

ommended that the request be sent 1

back to the Planning and Zoning
Commission.

Aldermen also awarded a $42,400
contract to Metro Gardens, a con-
struction company from“ Glencoe, to
build a joint-use fitness trail in Crest-

;fwoodgpark. Metro Gardens submitted
_ g the lowest of three bids.

The city received $26,780 from the

state and $20,000 from the Crestwood '

Rotary Club for the trail. The city
would pay the remainder of the total

cost of $64,836, City Administrator

Kent Leiclrliter said.

Aldermen approved the purchase ;

of three police cars from Sunset
Ford, 11860. Gravois Road, Sunset
Hills, which submitted a low bid of
$36,807 for the Crown Victoria four-
door vehicles. The bid was the lowest
of three.

 

Aldermen also approved buying a
four-wheel-drive Bronco vehicle for
the Public Works Department from
Sunset Ford for $17,300. The bid was
the lowest of two; the city rejected a

third bid because it did not meet ,

specifications.

National Pet Week —
May 1 to 7:

pet ownership
means commitment

By Elizabeth A. Brown
Stall writer of The Chri tian Science Monitor
F dog is man’s best friend,
maybe dog should think twice.
Last year more than 12 million
dogs and cats went through
animal shelters across Amer-
ica. Less than one-third were re-
turned to their owners or adopted out
to new homes The remaining 8 mil-
lion were put to death.

According to Barbara Cassidy, di-
rector of Animal Sheltering and Con-
trol at the Humane Society of the
United States, most animals end up in
shelters because their owners are
irresponsible. '

“Irresponsible ownership can take
many forms,”~ Ms. Cassidy says, de-
scribing the greatest oifender as one
who allows his animal to roam free -
without supervision, proper identiﬁ-
cation, license, or vaccination. These
animals can get lost, killed, or become
dangerous to families and property.

In the same category of irresponsi-
ble owners are “people who have ob-
tainedananimalonawhim-forthe
wrong reasons - and then decide the
animal is not suitable for them,”
Cassidy comments.

In such cases, surrendering the un-
wanted animal to a shelter “is the
most responsible thing they can do,

 




 

 

instead of turning it loose or giving it
to someone else who isn’t prepared to
care for it.”

Steps toward satisfaction

Ian Dunbar, a veterinarian in Oak-
land, Calif ., says that when people
are dissatisﬁed with their pets, it’s
usually because of behavioral prob-
lems - such as house soiling, biting,
barking, or overactivity. ,

With proper training, says Dr.

; Dunbar, “these bad habits could have

been broken in the early years.”
“People fail to recognize what a

think they want.

addition to the family.

These counselors also screen and
accept or reject potential adoptive
families - to be certain that the ani-
mals are going to good homes, and
won’t end up back at the animal
shelter.

for an average of

Endemic to our throwaway soci-
ety, says Mr. Lockwood, “people
can’t make a commitment. . . . When
things don’t work out right, the ani-
mal is seen as disposable.”

Feeding, grooming, exercising, and
training are vital to a happy' pet
household. “Humane education can
help people develop realistic expecta-

Staged lion hunts on Texas isle
trigger wildlife officials’ outrage

By Melinda Henneberger
The Dallas Morning News

DALLAS - On a secluded is-
land in the marshlands of Trinity
Bay along the Texas coast, an Afri-
can lion raised in captivity was re-
leased from his cage and given an
hour‘s head start.

Before long. Larry Wilburn and
a hunter who paid him $3,500
caught up to their prey, which was
crouched in a thicket. They circled,
unable to get a clear shot.

“We threw rocks in to spook
him out, and he charged us at that
point." Wilburn recalled. “We killed
him at 10 feet away.”

Wilburn, who organizes lion
hunts on the island owned by his
family. said he has a waiting list of
eager trophy-seekers who “don't
want the trouble of going to Africa."

“Canned" lion hunts have be-
come quietly popular in recent
months. said Wilburn, who got into
the business two years ago. As lions
become increasingly rare in their
natural habitat, the Texas alterna-
tive offers hunters “a better trophy
at halfthe price,“ he said.

Wilburn’s enterprise abruptly
went public last month when a fish-
erman discovered two skinned,
headless lion carcasses on govern-
ment land adjacent to Wilburn‘s
property. The fisherman reported
his find to the US. Army Corps of
Engineers. which in turn alerted
authorities with the US. Fish and
Wildlife Service.

Though lion hunting is not ille-
gal in Texas, “to us and many peo-
ple it’s regrettable and distasteful
to treat an old lion in this manner,”
said Ken Bonham, spokesman for
the corps.

“Those lions have been hand-
raised as pets and are being taken
out to be shot for so-called sport,"
said PC. Hanes. who heads Central
Texas Wildlife, an animal-rights or-
ganization. “What kind of sport is it
if you go out and shoot your dog and
mount his head?"

Many hunters oppose the staged
hunts, saying they should not be
characterized as sport.

“That‘s about the most revolt-
ing, disgusting thing I've heard in a
long time," said Steve Christenson,
past president of the Dallas Safari
Club and publisher of the club’s
magazine, Hunter’s Quest.

__.__._.___._

“In Africa, it’s interesting” to
hunt the native beast, said Christen-
son, who has gone on 15 safaris in
Tanzania, Botswana and Zambia.
“To hunt an African‘ lionlunder any
other circumstances is degrading to
the lion. If it’s unfair to the lion. it’s
unpalatable to many of us."

 

 

‘Those lions have been
hand-raised as pets and are
being taken out to be shot
for so—oalled sport. What kind
of sport is it it you go out

and shoot your dog and
mount his head?’

- no. Hana,
Animal rights activist

Officials with federal and state
agencies governing wildlife charac-
terize domestic lion hunting as a
dubious practice. But, they say, they
are unable to do anything about it.

Imogene and Monroe Byrd de-
cided to take matters into their own
hands after learning that at least
one of the lions they raised on a
ranch in Lometa, west of Temple.
had become a hunter’s prey.

In a recent issue of a hunting
magazine, the Byrds spotted a photo
of a smiling hunter standing over a
dead lion; the couple said they rec-
ognized it as Paul, one of the lions

they had raised.

One morning last week, the li-
ons' owner, rancher Fred Gist -
who pays the Byrds to raise the li-
ons for him -— arrived to collect the
last of the 45 big cats he once kept
on the Byrds’ land. The Byrds were
determined to stop him.

They attempted to prevent him
from taking a lioness and two cubs,
an effort that led to Byrd firing gun-
shots into the air. Gist claims he
was shot at and has ﬁled suit. Byrd
faces criminal and civil charges.

The incident dramatized the
controversy between those like the
Byrds —— who say lions raised in
captivity should not be hunted as
prey —— and the growing number of
Texas ranchers who stage big-game
hunts for big money.

African lions are among the me
nagerie of exotic animals bred and
auctioned all over Texas.

“Noah would have been jeal-
ous.” said Jim Stinebaugh of the
Fish and Wildlife Service. “He
wouldn’t have had to go far in Tex-
as to fill up the ark."

Because the African lion is not
considered a game animal, “it has
the same status as a rabbit," said
Phil Evans, regulatory coordinator
for the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department. “They can be hunted
at any time, in any number. They
could be considered personal prop-
erty."

The discovery of the two lion
carcasses on federal property last
month gave federal officials a pre-
text for investigating the lion-hunt-
ing business in Texas. he said.

Though hunting lions is not ille-
gal. hunting is forbidden on the
Wallisville Reservoir property.
where the carcasses were discov-
ered.

“We’re investigating, but basi-
callythere's not anything they can
do with those lions that would be il-
legal," Stinebaugh said. “The only
thing we have on him is that the li-
ons were on federal land. it's a
weak premise, but it’s something to
hold on to.”

Last week, Wilburn was ticketed
for depositing an animal carcass on
government property. “Basically.
it's the same. charge as littering"
and carries a fine of $50. said
Charles Craddock. a park ranger for
the Army Corps of Engineers.

Wilburn also was charged with
conducting commercial activity on
government preperty without writ-
ten permission of the district engi-
neer - a misdemeanor offense car
rying a $75 penalty.

Stinebaugh said he is concerned
about cruelty to the lions and the
risk involved in raising and trans-
porting them.

“It’s a very sad situation," he
said. “Those lions belong to private
owners. and there’s not ever any-
thing good going to happen to those
catsf‘

Some other states, including
New Mexico. Arizona. California
and New York. have laws against
hunts such as those staged on Wil-
burn’s property. Those who buy any
dangerous cat in those states must
have a permit.

"I feel like Texas needs laws.
too." Stinebaugh said.

THE HOUSTON CHRONICLE - March 4, 1986

No love in the air

Zoo seeks grant to find ways to increase U.S. rhino population

 

By BILL MINTZ
f-iouston Chronicle

 

The biological clock is running for endangered
white rhinoceroses, and Houston Zoo officials want
to help the huge animals make babies.

Veterinarian Terry Blasdel said the horns of the
lilemma for the Houston Zoo’s male rhino, Sam-
iuru, are twofold: He needs competition to get him
stimulated and the 200’s female, Marsabit, “is big-
:er than he is and intimidates him.

Adult white rhinos, the second largest land ani-
nal, weigh two to three tons.

Zoo officials have asked City Council to approve

an application for a $24,906 grant from the U.S.‘

Institute of Museum Services to finance a program
to help expand the pOpulation of about 150 white
rhinos in the nation’s zoos by studying their repro-
ductive systems and deve10ping an artificial insem-
ination procedure. .

Both Houston rhinos, captured from the wild, are
18 years old, Blasdel said. “Although white rhinos
have lived until their 50s, they are reproductive
only until their mid-20s.

“More than 50 percent of the white rhinos in the
U.S..are between 10 and 20. We are running out of
time.”

Eventually, U.S. zoo experts plan to shift the
white rhinos into herds at game ranches, but the

 

“genetic diversity" of the current p0pulation needs
to be put to use first, Blasdel said.

Some white rhinos have been born in captivity.
he said, but they reproduce much better in herds.
“They are social, gregarious animals,” Blasdel said.

Putting other rhinos — even other species —-
nearby sometimes does the trick. Lately, officials
have been bringing in rhino urine and feces from
other zoos to excite Houston‘s rhinos — with some
positive results for Marsabit. “When she is in heat,"

!

Blasdel said, “it makes her kind of crazy."

The white rhino program is part of US. zoos’
cooperative program, called the Species Survival
Plan, to propagate endangered species.

CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER — March 8, 1986

‘Extremely agitated’ polar bear

kills intended mate at Illinois zoo

BROOKFIELD, Ill. (AP) - A
925-pound polar bear named Caesar
mauled and killed his intended mate,
Princess Snowball, at a zoo yesterday
as keepers used prongs and water

'hoses in futile attempts to separate

them‘, a spokeswoman said.

Keepers had placed the animals
together in a private grotto in hOpes
that'they Would eventually mate and
produce offspring, said C. Jean Baker,
spokeswoman for Brookfield Zoo in
southwest suburban Chicago.

The two had been kept separate
previously with a wire screen,‘Baker
said.

“The male became extremely agi-
tated almost immediately when the
female entered,” said Baker.

“He attacked and went for her

throat,” the spokeswoman said.

The bears had begun the typical
mating ritual called “pawing,” Baker
said, but Caesar apparently became
overly aggressive and began clawing
Princess Snowball.

“He became more excited and
began to bite her,” said the zoo spo-
keswoman, who added that a bite on
Princess Snowball’s neck apparently
was fatal. A necropsy will be per-
formed, she said. '

Caesar, who was brought to Brook-
field from a zoo in Knoxville, Tenn. in
November, had sired cubs at other
zoos and never had exhibited vicious
behavior, Baker said.

After his capture, he had lived at
the Cleveland MetrOparks zoo. How-
ever, Cleveland zoo officials said last

\

night they did not remember Caesar
being there. . ‘

Ceasar and Princess Snowball were
both just over 20 years old and were
captured in separate expeditions off
the coast of Norway in 1965, accord-
ing to the zoo spokeswoman.

Princess Snowball has had five
cubs, the spokeswoman said.

Edward Schmitt, assistant director
of the 200, said that the bears are
aggressive by nature. However, he
said yesterday’s mauling was the first
time a serious attack had occurred
during the mating of polar bears at
the zoo.

“In the wild, males have been
known to kill females and smaller
bears, even for food,’ Schmitt said.

LOS ANGELES TIMES MAGAZINE - March 2, 1986

was sitting with my hus-

band, Robert Trages-
ser—a 6-foot, 4-inch logi-
cian—in a waiting room on
Ventura Boulevard in Sher-
man Oaks. With us were
Max MacElroy DVM,his as-
sistant Lynne Perry and
Cinder, a 6-month-old
leopard who was leaping
for Robert’s back. Robert
was trying—and failing——
to figure out what was hap-
pening to him. (Exactly
how logicians end up in
such enviable situations is
a trade secret.)

I knew what was happen-
ing to him: Cinder is, like
any kitty cat, intensely in-
terested in people, and es-
pecially interested in figur-
ing out which person in a
room is the most interest-
ing one to unsettle. Robert
qualified because he’s tall
(leopards love trees and

are alert to height). It was
also the first time he had
found himself in the pres-
ence of a young, energetic
and intelligent leopard, so
he was sending out incon-
gruent signals that made
Cinder curious. You know
about cats and curiosity.

The old saying has it
wrong, though. It is usually
the mouse that is killed by

Too Much Leopard

BY VICKI HEARNE

 

the cat’s curiosity, not the
cat, and even if a mouse is a
logician, satisfaction of the
cat’s curiosity doesn’t bring
the victim back.

Robert wasn’t killed, but
he did lose his heart to Cin-
der. This sort of thing hap-
pens with leopards, which
is how MacElroy came to
have big cats. The first one
he had was Rocky, a lion,
brought to him about 25
years ago at the age of 8

weeks with Virtually every
bone in his body broken.
These were fractures
caused by rickets. There

was a bobcat with a similar
story. Cinder’s mother had
such a story. MacElroy fixes
them up instead of putting
them down, and that’s how
they become his pets.

It’s because Cinder is
properly handled that she
didn’t eat up Robert. An
enormous amount of atten-
tiveness is required in or-
der to end up with a men-
tally and physically healthy
and safe leopard in captivi~
ty. MacElroy and Perry have
the rare capacity for this at-
tentiveness.

Leopards, according to

Bob Wagner at the Ameri-

thought of as the most cun-

are unlike lions, for exam-
ple, in that they spend a lot
of time in trees, and can
even carry their kills—up
to 45 pounds, about half
their own size—into tree-
tops and consume their
dinners in the branches.

HoUston ZOo plans $57, 600 study of rhinos’ sex lives

HOUSTON POST

Wants Council OK
to seek federal grant

By MARK OBBIE
Post Reporter

Until now, it has been Sam-
buru’s secret.

But the keepers of the 18-year-
old Southern white rhinoceros
want to tell all the world that Sam-
buru hasn’t been able to impreg-
nate his mate, Marsabit —- despite
15 years of opportunities.

Houston Zoo officials have gone
public with that tidbit in the form
of a proposal for a $25,000 federal
grant. The zoo wants the City
Council to approve the grant appli-
cation today to help pay for a

 

The study, which will concen-
trate on Samburu and Marsabit,
will be aimed at developing an ar-
tificial insemination method for
rhinos and establishing Houston as
a central stud farm for the rare
beasts.

While Samburu’s predicament
is at issue, zoo veterinarian Terry
Blasdel hopes the study helps oth-
er rhinos with similar problems.

“Our goal is conservation,” said
Blasdel, a reproductive physiolo-
gist and zoo research curator.

Houston’s white rhinos, one of
25 pairs in captivity, have been at
the zoo since 1971, five years after

they were captured in Africa,
Blasdel said. Despite a number of
encouragements, zookeepers
haven’t been able to consummate
the marriage.

“They’re not quite as bad as
pandas, because they will repro-
duce when they’re in groups,”
Blasdel said.

One problem, according to zoo
gossip, is the two animals’ relative
sizes.

“She’s larger than he is,” Blas-
del said. “We think she intimi-
dates him.”

One of Blasdel’s chores Monday
was the collection of Marsabit’s
and Samburu’s feces and urine —
in the interest of romance, of
course. Houston trades the stuff
with other zoos, freezing it until
zookeepers visit their counter-

Since rhino impotence can be
blamed on keeping. the animals in
pairs instead of herds, zookeepers
try to trick the rhinoceroses into
thinking they’re in a herd by
spreading other rhinos’ wastes,
Blasdel said. The herd instinct
helps males who need “the stimu-
lation of two or three females,”
the rhino vet said.

“I’ve spread it before and it had

’ rather dramatic effects,” Blasdel

said, referring to Samburu’s at-
tempted — but not completed —
advances.

According to documents sent to
the City Council, the zoo hopes to
snare the $25,000 grant from the
Institute of Museum Services and
supplement it with another $32,600
in private donations. Whatever is

tive habits and artificial insemina-

tion possibilities will be applicable
to other, equally endangered rhino
species, Blasdel said.

The issue isn’t just academic ——
for Marsabit and Samburu, oz to;
any rhinoceroses.

Rhinos can live to age 50, but
the oldest known pregnant rial..-
was 23 and the rule of thumb is
that rhinos normally reproduce
until they reach age 20, Blasdel
said.

According to a rhino “stud
book,” more than half the captive
population is 10 to 20 years old
now, which means their biological
clocks are ticking. And the study.
if it is approved today by the City
Council and blessed with the feder-
al grant, could take up to two
years.

“We’re dealing with an aging
population,” she said. “Time is
running out.”

Fort Cronkite: Where Marine
Mammals Recuperate in Marin

0 one was expecting the pup to be

born. Not Laurie Gage, the veterinar-

ian; not Debbie Vandenbroek, the di-

rector of animal care; and none of the
200 volunteers. In fact, the only one who
knew that things were about to change
around the California Marine Mammal
Center at Fort Cronkite was the pup’s
mother, Arseno. Her father, Chariot, may
have sensed something, but it still must have
caught him by surprise. After all, California
sea lions are born only in summer, aren’t
they?

Apparently not. On December 5, 1985,
in one of the cages at the Marine Mammal
Center, Arseno, a blind California sea lion,

' gave birth to her pup, Belfast. Unfortunate-
ly, Chariot couldn’t watch the delivery: He’s
blind, too. But a group of human beings was
on hand to witness the birth; a visitor report-
ed to a staff member that something was,
well, ﬁshy in one of the cages, and Belfast
was born before an audience of school chil-
dren and center volunteers and staff mem-
bers. And all were amazed. You see, not on-
ly do the books and scientists say that sea
lions are rarely born later than September,
but Vandenbroek had just recently com-

 

 

    

mented to one of the volunteers how slender
and healthy Arseno was looking.

The California Marine Mammal Center
is a private, non—proﬁt organization dedicat-
ed to rescuing and rehabilitating injured and
ailing marine mammals—primarily seals
and sea lions, but occasionally whales and
dolphins as well. Most of the animals have
been stricken by natural maladies, notably
pneumonia, stomach ulcers and an as yet
unnamed skin disease. In the last two years,
leptospirosis, an epidemic bacterial disease
of the kidney and liver, has also accounted
for a large number of sick sea lions.

The center, which hosts approximately
40,000 visitors a year, was ﬁrst incorporated
in 1975. Since that time it has treated and
released hundreds of stranded animals. In
1984, the center admitted 296 patients; last
year, there were 94. The number varies
widely, but there are usually no more than
30 to 35 recuperating at any one time.

It usually begins with a phone call. An
animal has been spotted washed up on a
beach somewhere between San Luis Obispo
and the Oregon border (the rescue area '
boundaries). A trained crew is dispatched to
the site, the animal is picked up, brought to
the center and diagnosed, and treatment is
begun as quickly as possible. (Note: Center
staffers implore you not to go near animals
you come across. First, they can be danger-

 

ous; second, mothers often leave their young
on'the beach temporarily to go ﬁshing—and
a pup touched by human hands may be
abandoned for good by its mother.)

Often the recent arrivals are so sick they
can’t eat the Atlantic herring the volunteers
feed them, and in such cases the ﬁsh must
be mashed and the animal tube-fed. Soon,
though, the seal or sea lion gets used to be-
ing fed and will eat the ﬁsh whole, although
at ﬁrst the dead ﬁsh are often viewed some-
what skeptically by the patients.

Most of the inﬁrm are well enough to re-
turn to the water after three to six months,
either on the beaches at the Marin head-
lands or up the coast at Point Reyes. It’s
while they’re convalescing that visitors can
get good views of them. Although some
lounge lethargically, seemingly unaware
they’re in the spotlight, others seize the op-
portunity to perform: clapping their rubbery
ﬂippers or slapping them against the water,
barking and belching and being rather audi-
bly offensive in general. You realize these
guys don’t need to be trained to be cut—ups.

The California Marine Mammal Center
is open to the public from 10 am. to 4 pm.
every day of the year. The center welcomes

TAMPA TRIBUNE - Feb. 27,1986

Cost of renovating
Lowry Park ZOO
up to $20 million

By BRUCE DUDLEY
Tribune ‘Staff Writer

The renovation of Tampa’s
Lowry Park Zoo got a new price tag
of $20 million Wednesday and an ini-
tial $3.4 million boost from support-
ers as a fund-raising drive to finance
the project began.

Also unveiled were a 13-member
blue ribbon cabinet to guide the
money search, a new zoo emblem
featuring three egrets, and a cam-
paign theme of “Bringing Down The
Bars,” relating to the cages that are

slated to become extinct with the

new zoo.

Since an initial design was pre-
pared for the new zoo in 1984, the
renovation price has jumped from
$10 million to $14.3 million to the
new $20 million goal. Zoo backers
expressed determination Wednes-
day to raise the $20 million and
more.

Tampa Mayor Bob Martinez,
whose administration already has
earmarked $8 million for the proj-
ect, and G. Pierce Wood, the chair-
man of the fund-raising cabinet,
launched the money drive with a
public announcement outside City
Hall and a private kickoff luncheon.

“With the inauguration of today’s
campaign, those who have benefited
from the facility in the past and
those who support our efforts to im-
prove the quality of life in Tampa
will have an opportunity to share in
a community partnership to com-
plete the construction of a new
Lowry Park Zoological Garden,”
Martinez said.

“Every great city needs a great
zoo,” declared Wood, who is execu-
tive vice president of Tampa Elec-
tric Co. Energy.

He said the first goal will be to
match the money already donated
by the city.

. Assisting Wood as co-chairmen
of the fund-raising campaign are
Charles P. Lykes of Lykes Brothers
and. Richard A. Beard III of the
Paragon Group.

Other members of the 200’s fund-
raising cabinet are 200 Association
Chairwoman Sally Lowry Baldwin,

Martin B. Solomon of Arthur Ander-

son & Co., Troy A. Brown Jr. of Ray»

Bro Electric, Kenneth G. Good of
Tampa Palms Development, Pat
Hoyt of Martinez’s office, Victor P.
Leavengood of General Telephone
Co., C. Lee Maynard of Barnett Bank
of Tampa, Michael D Osterhout of
radio station WRBQ (105 FM), Jef-
fery R. Parker of Pepsi Cola Bottling
of Tampa, and Robert A. Walter of
Interbay Development Corp.

Wood particularly cited pledges
from Pepsi Cola, TECO, GTE, the
Jim Walter Corp., Lykes Brothers,
Peoples Gas, radio station WRBQ-
FM, the Paragon Group, Barnett
Bank and Arthur Anderson & Co.
Along with other donations from
cabinet members, the pledges total
about $3.4 million.

Special mention also was made
of members of the Lowry family and
the estate of Lt. Gen. Sumter L.
Lowry, which donated $500,000 for

improving the 27-year-old animal ex-
hibit on Dec. 10.

Martinez told a small crowd on
the Franklin Street Mall the zoo
renovation is “a project that we are
all in love with.”

Although the fund- -raising effort
initially will be aimed at larger cor-
poration gifts, Martinez said, “it’s
everybody’s 200.” He said school
groups and individuals also should
“participate, as some already have.

The David Nelson Construction
Co. of Tampa has begun working on
the $6.4 million first phase of the
zoo, scheduled for a 1987 fall open-
ing. The New Orleans-based firm of
Design Consortium is beginning
work on plans for two more phases.

The first phase will include an

gAsian domain exhibit featuring ele-

phants and tigers among other ani-
mals. Included in the first phase are
a primate or monkey display, an avi-
ary, a childrens’ petting 200, an ori-
entation center, and an animal nurs-
ery and bird-rearing facility.

Second and third phases of the
zoo renovations are to include an
African savanna, a reptile house and
a Florida exhibit, featuring wildlife
native to the state.

As part of the fund-raising cere-
mony, Baldwin unveiled a emblem
for the zoo designed to illustrate the
natural habitats of the new 200 and

‘ its emphasis~ on Florida wildlife.

Zoo officials said the egret was
chosen because of its significance in
wildlife conservation efforts in the

 

Lowry Park Zoo’s new emblem
features three egrets.

Metrozoo Goes Deener Into African Plains

Miami Metrozoo is celebrating its ﬁfth year
with the debut of three new African exhibits,
expansion of the Free-F lying Bird Show and
opening of the Zoofari Monorail’s ﬁnal station.

The zoo is a progressive, cageless setting
where animals roam free on islands surround-
ed by moats in environments that closely
resemble their native habitats. Opened in 1981,
Metrozoo has expanded 15 acres for a total of
280 developed acres.

The African elephant exhibit is the ﬁrst new
display along the expanded African loop.
Previously exhibited with the 200’s Asian
elephants, three African elephants will have a
spacious paddock of their own, complete with

exhibit.

Metrozoo’s black rhinoceroses occupy the
third new exhibit. Toshi, the male rhino im-
ported from the Hiroshima Zoo two years ago,
resides with two female rhinos: Cora, from the
Crandon Park Zoo on Key Biscayne,
predecessor of Metrozoo, and Lulu, on
breeding loan from the Boston Zoo.

The work of zookeepers comes under
keener scrutiny from the public in the 200’s new
Facts and Feeding programs, including
demonstrations and explanation of zoo feedings.
Metrozoo managers launched this public show-
ing in response to visitors’ stated need to learn
more about the animals they see.

Facts and Feeding demos occur daily with
Himalayan black bears, Malayan sun bears and
European brown bears.

Bird Show Expands

An emu named Sydney and a soaring black
vulture are the new additions to Metrozoo’s
Free-Flying Bird Show. The show is produced
by trainer Ray Berwick, whose credits include
the animal effects for “Bird Man of Alcatraz”
and Alfred Hitchcock’s “The Birds.”

The popular show has expanded its routines:
the dramatic opening has a ﬂock of white
pigeons swooping and circling around the am-
phitheater stage. Talking parrots imitate
everything from crying babies to squealing pigs,
and Sly Sylvester, a green-winged macaw, adds' .'
his wit to the repartee.

The show demonstrates the natural abilities
and beauty of each bird featured. The show is
presented at 12 noon, 2 and 4:30 p.m. on
weekdays; at 11 a.m., 1, 3 and 4:30 p.m. on
holidays and peak season.

Metrozoo is open every day of the year from
10 am. to 5:30 p.m. with ticket booths clos-
ing at 4 p.m. Admission is $5 for adults, $2.50
for children 12 and under and ﬁ'ee for children
under two.Group rates are discounted from 15
to 20 percent. Contact: (305) 251-0401.

 

 

The 200’s new walkway extends beyond the
rhino exhibit to the fourth and ﬁnal Zoofari
Monorail Station. Zoo visitors now have the op-
tion of getting on and off the monorail in this
just—completed area.

The $13 million monorail system provides
visitors with a bird’s—eye view of the zoo in cool,
airconditioned comfort. Trained drivers narrate
the ride, with information on the 200’s design,
its history and exotic species, and facts about
the animals.

Following the same path as the zoo’s
walkways, the elevated trains afford views of
the entire park, especially the back areas and
animal holding pens camouﬂaged from View on
the ground. From the air, one can see how the
whole park works. ,

Opened in 1981, Metrozoo has been rated as
one of the top 10 zoos in the country and one
of the larger zoos in the world. More than
793,000 visitors were recorded last year.

Said Bob Yokel, Metrozoo director, “Growth
and change will continue to characterize
Metrozoo’s future, ﬁirther increasing its poten-
tial as a tourist magnet, a leader in conserva-
tion programs and as a strong community
resource.”

There are other new features at Metrozoo:

close-tins and Hands-0n

Docents from the Zoological Society of
Florida assist visitors with “Zoo Close-Ups,”
a program which allows zoo-goers to see and
touch small animals. Ferrets, snakes,
hedgehogs and a monkey are available for close-
up viewing and touch.

Zoo ofﬁcials are hOpeful that such hands-on
experience will give visitors a deeper
understanding and appreciation of the exotic
animals they observe at the zoo. The close-ups
program takes place Thursday through Sunday
from noon to 3 p.m.

Bisser, the Soviet snow leopard, is willing to
chuffle. But, unfazed by the spirit of the Geneva
summit, that is about all.

The mammal keepers at the Bronx Zoo have
been trying to mate Bisser, a male they received
last summer from the Moscow Zoo, with two
Bronx Zoo females.

But Bisser is having none ofit. He occasion-
ally chuffles -— the word keepers use to describe
the loud, breathy purr that signals desire in
snow leopards —- at Olga and Hoth, who are tak-
ing turns trying to seduce him at the Carnivore
House. But when the female felines chuffle back

and try to rub up against him, Bisser runs away .

or cuffs them about the face instead of as uming

In a mating session yesterday morning, Olga,

.an experienced cat with two litters to her credit,

left Bisser completely cold. He did not even get
down from his high perch. Hoth, the younger and
more aggressive female, climbed up to his perch
and was met with a threatening growl.

‘He Could Be a Dud’

“He could be inexperienced,” a keeper,
Laurie Thomas, said, watching the mating
dance. “Or he could be a dud.”

mate. But, when they do go into heat — in Febru-
ary —— they are normally extremely eager, espe-
cially the males. .

“It’s the first time I’ve ever seen a problem
with a male snow leopard,” said Mrs. Thomas. ‘

Although the keepers have been making jokes
behind the recalcitrant Bisser’s back about his
Communist connections, they do not want to
give up, because, as Mrs. Thomas put it, “we
really want his genes in our population.”

So they keep up his strength with the cattle
“knuckle bones” that snow leopards like to
munch on, and they consider the possiblity of
using mood enhancers. “Maybe a little cande-
light and caviar would do it,” a curator, James
Doherty, mused. “Who knows?”

 

 

 

 

 




THE HOUSTON POST - Feb. 9, 1986

200 COStS soar Project's budget overruns ,

as lions roar

By JOHN GRAVOIS
Post Reporter

 

The biggest attraction at the Houston Zoo - the
new, large cat compound -— has run up almost $1
million in cost overruns, largely because of design
work that some zoo keepers say was botched by one of
the city’s most noted architectural firms.

One of the problems was illustrated in dramatic
fashion recently when John Focke, a top official for
the architectural firm, CRS Sirrine, was invited to
confront a lion by senior zoo keeper John Gilbert.

At an appropriate moment — as Focke stood inches
away from a lion named Bean, with only a cage fence
separating the two —- Gilbert made a hand gesture
that caused Bean to jump and roar ferociously, shak-
ing the cage violently and shocking Focke.

“That lion shook the whole building,” said Focke,
senior vice president of public affairs for CRS Sirrine.
It was especially intimidating because the lion had
been “chewing up a bowling ball” immediately before

he jumped and roared.

“It certainly got my attention. We agreed to make

the (design) change after that,” he said.

The firm’s original design called for a chain-link-
style of fencing that allowed some ﬂexibility in the}

cage walls. However, the zoo keep-l

ers who handle 450-pound tigers,
lions and other cats felt unsafe
with that flexibility. They de-
manded more rigid fencing.

But CRS Sirrine — which has
helped build defense systems in
Saudi Arabia, cereal processing
plants in China and office build-
ings in Korea — wasn’t at all con-
vinced the fence material for
which it called was inadequate.

So Gilbert arranged a behind-

the-scenes tour for Focke and city
officials.
. Gilbert defended setting up
Bean’s display of aggression, say-
mg: “I wanted to show those peo-
ple the true potential for danger. It
was effective, too. It shows that
sometimes actions speak louder
than words.”

At the time, Gilbert said he had
no idea his little display would ul-
timately cost taxpayers hundreds
.of thousands of dollars. “But I feel
like it’s money well spent,” he
said. “Remember, we’re talking
about safety here.”

In all, design problems with the
cat compound, part of which is
still under construction, have
raised the project’s original $5.5
million construction budget to al-
most $6.4 million.

More than $700,000 worth of the
extra work has been attributed to
deficiencies by CRS Sirrine in de-
signing the compound’s interior
cages. The most recent change or-
der —- a $307,000 contract — was

\J/

approved last week by the City
Council.

CRS Sirrine officials have
vowed to pay a “fair share” of the
cost overruns and now are negoti-
ating the matter with city offi-
cials. The company has handled
projects worth hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars for local govern-
mental agencies.

Zoo officials stressed that their
safety concerns focused on cat
keepers, not the public because it
would be all but impossible for a
cat to escape the interior cage
complex even if it gets out of its
individual cage.

“Our philosophy is you can nev-
er be too safe,” said Gilbert.
“With these animals, you some-
times don’t get a second chance
when it comes to safety.”

Focke and zoo director John
Werler agree there’s a chance the
original, ﬂexible cage material
would have proved adequate.

“We still think it was structur-
ally strong enough, but it wasn’t
what they were accustomed to be-
cause of the ﬂexibility,” Focke
said, adding that the suggested
material was modeled after the
fences used to cage the cats at the
London Zoo.

Focke said his firm searched
around the world for an expert
consultant to help them design the
fence. “There just weren’t any
around, though. This is a unique
field,” he said.

linked to safety concerns

“The question really was about
the material’s integrity over the
long haul,” Werler said. “We
might have gotten by without the
change, but we determined the
change was the safe way to pro-
ceed.” .

The change in cage materlals
proved to be not only costly, but
time consuming. The cat com-
pound’s spring opening was
pushed back to November.

The compound became the 200’s
most popular attraction overnight,
touting a pair of recently acqulred
white Bengal tigers as its biggest
stars.

Until the new compound
opened, the cats were kept in con-
crete block houses separated from
the public by glass and steel bars.
Now they roam more freely in
large Plexiglas and wire-fenced

enclosures, each designed to re-
semble the cats’ natural environ-
ment. .

The interior cages in question
are out of public view.

The cage material hasn’t been
the project’s only problem.

serves as the cat compound’s
backdrop had to be moved be-
cause some zoo officials feared a
tiger might be able to climb it and
use it as a platform to jump out of
the compound. .
Fences separating the public
from the cats have been moved
more than once to improve securi-
ty and a “hot wire” —- an electri-
cally charged cable — , has been
added to help discourage the ani-
mals from trying to flee. The wire
even stretches around a moat in
which tigers swim in the com
pound. .

“We didn’t push those changes
because there was any danger to
the public,” Gilbert said. “It’s al-
most an impossibility for a cat to
get out into a public area. We just
want to super-ensure security.”

Yet another problem involved
landscaping.

Focke said great care went into
selecting plants for the compound:
“We wanted everything to be as
natural as possible. In addition,
we had to worry about whether

some of the
plants would
be toxic to the
animals.”

But when
the compound
opened, all
that work was
for naught,
Focke said.

‘ ‘Those

had never set

Several city officials privately

called the cat house fiasco an em- '

barrassment for both the city and
"CBS Sirrine. . .

“You won’t get anyone to tell‘

you this on the record, but this is
so hilarious and embarrassing
that no one, including CRS, wants
their name connected with it,”
said one official. “They were hop~
ing the public would never hear
these stories.”

But Parks Director Don Olson,
who oversees zoo operations, said
this is no laughing matter.

“I’m not happy with the over-
runs we’ve had and we’re taking a
hard look at them right now,” 01-
son said. “I haven’t laughed about
this at all.” . -

Dan Jones, city public works
spokesman, said his department
also is upset with the overruns.
“And we don’t feel the taxpayers

should have to
payfor it,” he
added. ‘

Problems at the zoo

 

A recent visit to the Cleveland
Metmparks zoo left me puzzled on
several counts. On my arrival, I disco—
vered that the early free admission
period had been eliminated and that
admission charges had been raised.
This would not have been upsetting
had. the policy been adequately publi~
cized. I found, however, that several
employees were unaware of the

i ‘change.

' This failure to communicate with
the public—or the zoo personnel—
seems symptomatic of the 200's
administration. 200 employees were
embarrassed and confused when
asked about the plans for the reloca-

1 . tion of the Cleveland Aquarium exhi-

bits. They told me that the informa-
tion had not been pr0perly
communicated to them. The recent
episodes involving the euthanasia of
the Siberian tiger and the disposal of
the animals at the children’s farm
indicate the larger failures to com-
municate effectively with the public.

This inability to communicate
extends to the educational programs.
The zoo has five full-time employees
in its education department, which is
headed by a staff member whose sal-
ary exceeds $40,000, yet the exhibits
and graphics are far from state of the
art. Likewise, contact with schools has
not kept pace with the needs of the
students. I know from my own experi-
ence as a school principal as well as a
zoo visitor how far short of expecta-
tions these programs fall.

Given the increased level of tax-
payer support of the zoo in recent
years, and the genuine efforts to
upgrade the physical facility, it is dis-
tressing to see this valuable asset
endangered by poor administrative
leadership and the declining employee
morale to which this has led I urge
your readers to monitor this situation
with greater care in the future.

HOUSTON CHRONI CLE

— March 7, 1986

Hermann Zoo’s. gorilla, Vanilla, is dead

 

By MAUREEN BALLEZA ‘
Houston Chronicle

 

Vanilla, a gorilla that spent most of
her life at the Hermann Zoo and was
well-known to many Houstonians, died
Wednesday morning in Brownsville.

Dr. Don Forest, director of the

Brownsville Zoo, said a mommy (post

mortem examination) revealed a
grapefruit-size tumor at the juncture of
the large and small intestines.

The 18-year-old lowland gorilla had
been ill for the past 10 days and was

. being treated for what seemed to be a

salmonella infection. She appeared to

be respbnding to the treatments and'

gadda good appetite the day .before she
1e .

Vanilla was under a 24-hour watch
from the onset of her illness but she
took a drastic turn for the worse about
midnight Tuesday and died at 7:30 am.
Wednesday, Forest said. .

She had been transferred to the

LOS ANGELES TIMES - March 7, 1986

Brownsville facility in the fall of 1985
for breeding purposes. Zoo keepers
were hoping Vanilla would prove more

* fertile in her new environment, after

' attempts to breed her here had failed.

Those attempts included the import-

ing of Abe, a 25 year old from Colorado
with a reputation for gentleness. But
Vanilla did not take his advances
kindly.

.In their first public appearance in
1982, she slugged him twice in the head.
He returned the punches with a left jab.

They went their separate ways before

long.

Sylvia Boyster, superintendent with
the Houston Parks and Recreation De-
partment, said Vanilla presented a
problem in breeding “because she was
a real lady.”

“She was very selective about who

she mated with. If you didn’t fit the .

prerequisites, it was no go, ” said Roys-
ter.

Vanilla spent most of her' life in
Houston, having arrived as a baby in

January, 1968. She was a favorite
among visitors and well-known for her
antics, such as throwing dung at her
keepers to express displeasure, along
with covering her ears when her public
grew too noisy for her.

“She was pretty reasonable when it
came to photos and antics but when it
came to breeding, she was less enter-
taining,” said Royster. ‘

It was hoped the transfer to the
larger, communal facility in Browns-
ville would be more conducive to the
demanding Vanilla. Hermann Zoo
would have shared in any offspring she
produced.

Royster said animals are sometimes
more susceptible to disease and it has
nothing to do with the facility. She said
if an animal dies while on loan, they
just have. to try to figure out where
they will find another one.

The only gorilla currently in resi-
dence at Hermann Zoo is 31-year-old
M’Kubwa, better known as Mac.

TAMPA TRIBUNE - March 19, 1986

Double treat:

Lowry Zoo

.gets elephant, donation

A zoo of a different kind, radio station WRBQ,
pledged $150,000 toward Lowry,’s renovation.
And the Tampa Board of Realtors plans to
raise enough funds to purchase an elephant.

By BRUCE DUDLEY
Tribune Staff Writer

A $20 million fund-raising cam-
paign to renovate the Lowry Park
Zoo received a double boost Tues-
day with a Tampa Board of Realtors’
pledge to purchase a new elephant
and a $150,000 gift from radio sta-
tion WRBQ.

The new elephant will replace
Sheena, the 200’s long-time resident
pachyderm who died unexpectedly
in January at a Canadian animal at-
traction where she was being housed
during the zoo renovation.

Tampa Realtor Dan Moore told
the Lowry Park Zoo Association that
the Realtors organization plans to
raise $20,000 to $40,000 to purchase
a full-grown elephant to replace
Sheena.

“Since our board was founded,
the Hillsborough County community
we serve has given so much of itself
to our organization that we want to
give something special in return,”
said Walt Hand, president of the
Realtors’ gratip.

Holly H. Duncan, the zoo associa-
tion’s development director, said the
association also has been contacted
by the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity
at the University of South Florida,
which wants to help raise funds for
the purchase of an additional ele-
phant

The Asian domain exhibit, which
will be included in the first phase of
the renovation, includes an area for
three elephants. Zoo personnel had
hoped Sheena would have been one
of these elephants along with a baby
elephant, if Sheena had become
pregnant while at the Canadian at-
traction.

 

But now zoo officials are looking
for all new elephants.

The WRBQ donation, which is
the first corporate gift to be re-
ceived by the zoo association, specif-
ically was earmarked for a planned
petting zoo that will be named after
the radio station’s morning show, the
Q- -Zoo.

The $150, 000 will be paid over a
five-year period as the renovation is
pieced together in phases.

The association also approved
the expenditure of about $425,000 to
include seVeral items in the 200’s

, first phase of construction that city

officials eliminated after bids came
in higher than anticipated.-

Items approved by the associa-
tion included a viewing tower in the
aviary exhibit and cave viewing
areas where visitors would enter a
cave and be able to get a close look
at tigers and bears through a glassed
display inside a rock formation.

The $425,000 expenditure,
recommended by Zoo Association
Chairwoman Sally Baldwin to ensure
the new Tampa zoo is special, will
be in addition to the $6.3 million con-
tract already approved with the
David Nelson Construction Co. of
Tampa to build the first phase of the
zoo renovation.

Olly the Otter, a puppet that will
be used in a special education pro-
gram to prdmote the zoo in area
schools, was introduced at the Tues-
day meeting.

Betty Greenwood, Olly’s owner,
said the otter and other puppets will
be used in a zoo educational pro-
gram being planned for students in
kindergarten through the third
grade.

Educational
value of zoos
is promoted

The use of a 200 as an educa-
tional tool was stressed to members
of the Lowry Park Zoo Association-
Friday by W. Thane Maynard, the

assistant curator of education at the
4'. Cincinnati Zoo.

Maynard, who recently hosted a
cable television

sociation at a luncheon held by Tam-
pa’s Barnett Bank where his brother,

_, C. Lee Maynard, is president.

Part of the $20 million renova-

* tion under way at the Lowry Park

Zoo will include an educational com-
plex. Maynard distributed brochures

; on the Cincinatti Zoo that described
educational efforts such as holding

classes for “Zoologists of Tomor

j row.”

During a slide presentation, May-

. hard particularly stressed medical
, advances that have been made at

the Cincinnati Zoo including embryo
transfers. One of these transfers,
Maynard said, made history in 1984
when a female African eland ante-
lope gave birth to a bongo antelope
of a different species.

Maynard also said the planned
Florida exhibit at Tampa’s ex-
panded zoo should be a particularly
valuable asset because many people
visiting the state will never have
seen some of the animals native to
Florida.

The David Nelson Construction
Co. of Tampa is now working on the
$6.4 million first phase of the zoo,

scheduled for a 1987 fall opening.

When 'Is One Sea Lion
Worth Three Tigers?

When New England ’5 zoos start trading
fer the animals they really want

EREFI OF one of its two

beluga whales, the Ma-

rinelife Aquarium, in

Mystic, Connecticut,

seemed as incomplete as
Fenway Park stripped of its left-ﬁeld
wall. Nanuk, the portly mammal who
bobbed in the whale tank, had waved
his ﬂippers, spit, and rolled over for the
last time. Now it was the aquarium
staff’s job to replace him, and quickly.
“But you can’t just go out and catch

a whale,” explains Laura Kezer, the
aquarium’s director of community re-

 

lations, who knows about such things.
Kezer, who has helped capture a dozen
of the quarter-ton mammals, is part of
an elite versed in the acquisitionofun-
usual creatures for New England’s
aquariums and zoos. “It takes a while,”
she says. “There are regulations.” In-
deed, those who make a living by pur-
chasing penguins, unloading giant lob-
sters, or settling gorillas in the suburbs,
are the zoological equivalent of base-
ball general managers: they purchase
talent, they make swaps, they raise
and train future stock, and they even

 

 

make deals for players to be named
later.

Zoological traders often begin their
search with the newsletter of the

_ American Association of Zoological

Parks and Aquariums, which lists the
free agents and reserves of the animal
kingdom. There, they learn that a zoo
in Omaha, Nebraska, is willing to give
away a Malayan sun bear, but would
like to trade twelve elegant-crested
tinamous and a two—year-old jaguar
for a pair of white-handed gibbons in
the blond phase. Elsewhere, some-
thing 'could be worked out with Los
Angeles for its swamp wallaby and
brindled gnu —— perhaps a three-way
deal involving a breeding loan of De—
troit’s black rhinoceros, or ownership
of Phoenix’s six black-billed whistling
ducks.

Other common acquisitions are
stranded animals, usually seals or dol-
phins, or rare tropical birds seized by
airport police before they hit the black
market. Zoo traders, however, Won’t
take just anything. “These days we
limit ourselves to what our facilities
can handle,” says Paul Sieswerda, of
Boston’s New England Aquarium.
“The stamp—collecting days for zoos
and aquariums are over.” But all zoo
directors have at least one animal pas-
sion for which they will go to great
lengths. For Sieswerda, it’s, the orca, a
$250,000 killer whale he calls the
“charismatic megavertebrate” of the
ocean —- and which is too big to ﬁt in
his aquarium’s tanks.

CROSS TOWN, Richard G.
Naegeli, director and curator
of Boston’s metropolitan zoo

system, hankers for gorillas. Thirteen
years ago, when Naegeli expected the
Franklin Park Zoo’s Tropical Forest
pavilion to be open in time for the 1976
Bicentennial, he arranged ﬁrst refusal
for a pair of baby gorillas from the
Cincinnati Zoo. In 1978 he talked mil-
lionaire car dealer Peter Fuller of Mar-
blehead into donating $50,000, and to-
gether they ﬂew to Cincinnati to adopt
the infants, named Sam and Gigi. Un-
fortunately, because the Franklin Park
Tropical Forest is still unfinished, Sam
and Gigi are residing at the Stone Zoo
in Stoneham, Massachusetts. Their
first son, Quito, has moved to the Mil—
waukee Zoo to start a family. Their
second, Kubando, is already hanging
out with Kiki, a young female brought
up from the Philadelphia Zoo. And
Sam and Gigi are expected to mate
again this spring. By the time the
Franklin Park facility ﬁnally opens,
Naegeli’s gorillas may be grandparents.

UT Naegeli’s problems are

small compared to Mystic’s

task: catching a replacement

beluga in the wild. For help, the

aquarium turned to a professional

outﬁt in Churchill, Manitoba, called

a N anuk Enterprises, run by a Canadian

Indian namedjohn Hicks and his seven
brothers.

“They charge seven thousand dol-

lars a whale,” reports Kezer, who

 

 

 

 

 

traveled to Churchill last summer for
the catch. Every morning for a week,
Hicks led a ﬂotilla of canoes containing
Kezer, several other aquarium staff
members, Canadian ﬁsheries ofﬁcials,
and a ﬁlm crew from National Geo-
graphic up and down the Churchill
River, where the thirteen-foot belu gas
bask like giant sea-sausages. Upon
sighting an appropriate, healthy 600-
pounder, Hicks chased it into shallow

. waters and ordered one of his brothers

(oﬂicially designated “whale jumpers”)
to leap out and subdue the catch. As the
other canoes converged on the mam-
mal, the crew rolled it over, deter-
mined its gender, and approved it for
capture.

Over ﬁve days, the crew took ten
such whales in large stretchers back to
Churchill, where they were run through
blood and belligerence tests. Five of
them (two for Mystic, three for the
National Aquarium in Baltimore)
were accepted. The naturalists packed
their booty in wooden crates lined with
foam rubber and wet bed sheets, and
coated the mammals with Crisco (“We
used to use lanolin,” says Kezer, “but it
was too expensive”). Then they hoisted
the whales aboard a chartered 737 and
sprayed them continuously with water
throughout the three—hour ﬂight to

' New York and the two-hour refriger-

ated truck trip to Mystic.

you’ll see Four and Ten, the two
hastily named belugas, bobbing
beside Aurora, Nanuk’s old mate. But
you won’t ﬁnd the stripers and blueﬁsh
in the aquarium’s long-running New
England Fishes exhibit, because
they’ve been sent to Oklahoma City in
consideration for a future trade. And
the ornery sea lion named Domino that
used to live here has been exiled to
Moscow (his name, of course, has been
changed to Dimitri). It was a complex
deal, involving the acquisition of three
Soviet Siberian tigers to offset a few
inbreeding problems in various Amer-
ican zoos. “Frankly, we were kind of
glad to see Domino go,” says Kezer.

“He caused some trouble.”

A nasty sea lion for three rare tigers?

A CLOSER LOOK

It’s a Jungle Out There

BY PAT TOMPKINS

 

—______

Although we are now trying to save some endangered species, animals in the
wild still face serious threats from humans.

“Saving the Wildlife” airs on Channel 9 on
Monday the 10th at 8:00 p. m. and
Saturday the 15th at 7:00pm.

 

HANKS TO TELEVISION ’S

countless wildlife shows, we are

more familiar with penguins than
with the common cow. Tamed by the
camera, lions, whales, pandas and eagles
appear in various guises: splendid,
charming, cute or simply fascinating—and,
above all, safe. But everything is not happy-
go—lucky in penguin land, nor is it business
as usual in the jungle these days. As Saving
the Wildlife reveals, these wild creatures
may someday survive only on ﬁlm—if we
fail to help them.

Already it’s too late to save several
species of tiger and lion; too late for the
sea mink, quagga and Tasmanian wolf; too
late for the great auk, Arabian ostrich and
New Zealand quail; too late for . . . well, the
list goes on. To keep the list of extinct
wildlife from becoming longer, govern-
ments and individuals around the world
are working to protect endangered
species. In Saving the Wildlife, the Bay Area
director-writer team of Hardy Jones and
Julia Whitty (In the Kingdom of the
Dolphins; Secrets of a Desert Sea) surveys
various solutions to complex conservation
problems. ’

Two locations where Jones, Whitty and
executive producer Nat Katzman ﬁlmed
their documentary—Northwestern India
and East Africa—illustrate different
responses to the problem of endangered
wildlife. Overpopulation in both regions
has created demands for more grazing
land, and wild animals are paying the
price.

In Africa, the economic exploitation of
wildlife is shifting from slaughter to
preservation, now that the international
ivory and horn trade has decimated the
elephant and black rhinoceros
populations. With 95 percent of its rhinos
killed since 1970, Kenya has set aside four
rhino sanctuaries, where the surviving ﬁve
hundred animals will be locked up and
guarded—alive but hardly living as
wildlife.

JULIA WHlTTY

4);:

Two at the endangered animals that are subjects
for concern on “Saving the Wildlife. ”

Tourists on safari—shooting photos
instead of animals—have helped game
preserves succeed where conserving
wildlife had been, until recently, a largely
foreign concept. “Wild animals will be
saved in Africa because they’re tourist
attractions,”Jones says. Conservation has
become an industry, now employing Masai
who once killed lions to protect their
cattle. But East Africa’s national parks are
still plagued by poachers.

Making this ﬁlm showed Jones that “it’s
incredibly expensive to the Earth to have
livestock on it.” Noting that the Ethiopian
catastrophe is the result of overgrazing, he
calls cattle “the second population
explosion.”

Nowhere is the cattle/wildlife conflict
more evident than in India, where cattle
outnumber people. The cow and the tiger
compete for the same land, and before
India banned tiger hunting in1968, the
number of tigers had been reduced to two
thousand. The establishment of preserves
for these jungle animals has helped the
number of tigers increase to four
thousand. Impressed by the Indian
response to the tigers’ plight,Jones credits
“the Indians’ reverence for wildlife.” Not
tourism, but respect for animals, which
keeps the population of c0ws so high, is
the primary motivation behind India’s
national park system.

Saving the Wildlife also shows Argentina,
China, Canada and Brazil protecting their
respective penguins, pandas, wolves and
monkeys, but one nation disregards others’
good intentions. According to Jones,
“Japan is the single most thoughtlessly
exploitive country in the world.” Citing its
aggressive economy, Whitty says, “The
Japanese go in, rape an environment, make
their quick buck and get out." Whilejapan
has made efforts to save its own wildlife,
Jones says, “TheJapanese are perfectly
willing to pillage the rest of the world.”

After a year’s work on Saving the
Wildlife, how do Jones and Whitty feel
about worldwide prospects for wildlife? ‘
“I am more alarmed now than when I I
started the project,”Jones says, recalling
the sight of entire hillsides burned down
to produce charcoal in Africa. ”Optimism
of the will and pessimism of the facts"
sums up Whitty’s feelings; the amount of
effort going on in different countries to
protect animals encourages her.

Describing the ﬁlm as “an antid0te” to
programs that simply tout the wonders of
nature, Whitty says, “It’s irresponsible to
talk only about our great natural
environment and avoid the real problems
facing animals.” Saving the Wildlife
reminds us that the resources needed for
saving tigers are resources we all need.
And when Jones says all animals are
endangered, he includes Homo sapiens,
the one animal with the power to correct
imbalances in nature.

During an interview in the ﬁlm, Jane
Goodall, the chimpanzee expert, says, “If
you want to help animals—~whether it’s to
improve conditions in captivity or to help
in conservation efforts—you must capture
people’s imagination. . . . If you don ’t, you
won’t help them one little tiny bit.” By
exploring the global conservation crisis
and some creative approaches to solving it,
capturing our imaginations is just what

Saving the Wildlife does. I

Houston Zoo wonders why rhinos-haven’t mated

Associated Press

HOUSTON A The Houston Zoo
was given the go-ahead Tuesday to
conduct a $57,600 study to ﬁnd out
why buru, a rare Southern
white rhinoceros, has failed for 15
years to impregnate his mate,
Marsabit.

The City Council approved with-
out comment the study of the rhi-
nos’ mating habits. The 200 will
apply for a $25,000 grant from the
US. Institute of Museum Services
and seek $32,600 in private
donatiOns.

The study, which could take up
to two years to complete, also
would investigate developing a
method of artiﬁcial insemination
and establishing a central stud

farm in Houston for the beasts,
said veterinarian Terry Blasdel, a
reproductive physiologist and 200
research curator.

Samburu and Marsabit —- one of
25 pairs of white rhinos in captivity
in the United States -— were cap«
tured in 1966 in Africa and brought
to the Houston Zoo ﬁve years later.

But Marsabit is 18 years old and
her biological clock is winding
down.

“White rhinos have lived until
their 505, but they are reproductive
only until their mid 205.”

“More than 50 percent of the
white rhinos in the US. are be-
tween 10 and 20," she said. “We’re
dealing with an aging population.
Time is running out.”

Samburu has shown interest. in
Marsabit over the years, Blasdel
said. .
“She's a little larger than he is.
She chased him around and intimi-
dated him and he couldn’t do any-
thing,” Blasdel said. “He got all ex-
cited but he was still afraid. He
would charge up to her and then
stop.” -

Zoo officials think Samburu
needs a little competiton to stimu-
late his interest.

“There was a zoo in Tokyo that
made a papier-mache rhinoceros
and put in with the rhinos and
they started breeding. Other .peo»
ple have done things like put in
mirrors so the animals think than
there are more animals than there
actually are," she said.

 

 

 




TAMPA TRIBUNE - March 10, 1986

West Shore Plaza cancels pettin
this year

An, economic decision caused the cancellation

of the Easter Animal Farm, which last year
drew more than 40,000 visitors.

 

By LENORA LAKE
Tribune Staff Writer

After 12 years, West Shore
Plaza’s popular Easter Animal
Farm, which featured a petting 200
of goats, sheep, chickens and other
farm animals, will not be staged this
year.

It was “simply a business deci-
sion,” West Shore Plaza General
.Manager John Jovich said.

“It was just too expensive for
what we were getting out of it,” said
A.B. Bryant, manager of West
Shore’s JCPenney’s and a member
of the mall’s board of directors. He
added that the directors and mail
management said they felt the dis-
play “did not generate the amount of
people needed for the amount we
had to spend to put it on."

Last year 40,000 people — in-
cluding some school classes on field
trips -—- went through the petting zoo
portion of the farm, according to
Sharon Grossenbacher of Dade City,
who staged the farm along with
about eight other friends/business

partners

“And that doesn‘t count the peo-
ple who just stood outside the railing
and wati‘ . Grossenbacher so id
“1’ think there will be a lot of dis ap-
pointed people this year.’

Two petting zoo areas —- featur-
ing hand-raised animals -— at oppo-
site ends of the mall were the focal
points of the free Easter Animal
Farm. A country house showed farm
tools and kitchen equipment; some-
times crafts or trades such as quilt
ing or sl er sheering were demon-
struted.

Instead of the farm, West Shore
Plaza this year will feature Easter
fashion shows, visits by the Easter
Bunny, a collector dolls show and a
"doll doctor "

The Easter Animal Farm began
as an outgr ewth of Old McDonai

Farm from the Florida State Fair,
Grossenbacher said.

“We were just a bunch of girls
who grew up together and worked at
Old McDonald’s Farm,” she said.
“When West Shore decided to start
staging the farm, they contacted us.”

 

From there, “it just got to be a
tradition.” ‘she added.

“We have kept guest books, and
the comments have always been ter-
rific," Grossenbacher said. “We
have had people write that they
have come all the way from Orlando
to show their grandchildren the ani-
mals.”

Some schools and preschools
took children on field trips to see the
animals.

“Our children always enjoyed it

. -— not just the little ones but the ones

all the way up to the seventh grade
or so,” said R.W. Palmer, headmas-
ter of Beach Park Private School.

; “Some of the city kids never get to
, see things that were there any other

way.”

The school did not know the
event was canceled this year and
had planned to go again, he said.

The decision to not stage the
farm was “totally a local decision
made jointly between the (mall’s)
board of directors and its manage-
ment,” said West Shore’s Jovich.

“Basically, we determined it was
not in the best interest of our tenants
and our customers,” continued Jo-
vich, who became the mall’s general
manager in July 1985.

“We just didn’t include it in our
1986 marketing budget,” said Jovich,
saying the mall “actually doubled
for 1986 our budget for promotions
over 1985.”

Grossenbacher and the other
friends/partners from the Lutz,
Zephyrhills and Dade City area
were paid to stage the farm, Gros-
senbacher said, but neither she nor
Jovich of West Shore would discuss
the amount of the fee.

Grossenbacher and her partners
do other promotions for West Shore
— including its Christmas display —
but she said they can stage the farm
elsewhere if another mall contacts
them.

West Shore’s previous manage-_
ment told Grossenbacher “the sales
were terrific” while the farm was
there, she said. (West Shore’s previ-

ous manager has left the company
and could not be reached; West
Shore’s former marketing manager
is now with Clearwater Mall but was

not available for comment.)

Jovich said that the current mall
management believes not having the
farm‘ ‘will not cut down on the num-

ber of people.’ . -

He added his belief that it “will
not hurt our sales in any way’5 or af-
fect the number of children who
come to have their pictures made

Bryant of JCPenney echoed Jo-
vich’s feeling concerning Easter
sales. ' .

“I don’t think it will affect us that
much; I don’t know that a lot of peo-
ple came here just because iot the
animal show,” he said. '

However, he added that “a‘l’ew”
potential shoppers “may stayaway,
but some others may come that
wouldn’t come if the farm” TWere
here.” "

Charles Moxley, senior “vice
president for sales and promotion at
Mass Brothers which is a majdr ten-
ant at West Shore, said he couldn’t
comment because “I’ve heard abso-
lutely zilch” about plans to cancel
the farm. '

Robinson’s manager Robert Kep-
pel said, “I’m new with Robinson’s
and wasn’t involved in the decision. I
wasn’t here when the farm «was
here, so I have no idea how this will
affect” Easter sales.

Marvin Scott is the owner of a
Tampa film company that had>the
Easter Bunny photo concession the
past three years. He did not get the
contract this year, but said, “person-
ally I think there will be less’i’chil-
dren for the pictures since the farm
is not being staged.

NEW YORK TIMES — March 11, 1986

European Bison, Bred of Zoo Stock,

They lumber unafraid
. in Polish preserve.

 

Roam the Wild Again

 

By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN

 

Special to The New York Times

. IALOWIEZA, Poland, March

7 — The hulking European

‘ , bison that ~ once survived

j 9 only in zoos are lumbering
unafraid these days along the Polish-

Soviet border in an Old czarist hunting
preserve where the last of their un-
penned ancestors died out 67 years
ago.

‘ , “They were once extinct in the
wild, but they have come back,” ex-
plained Zbigniew Krasinski, a veteri-
narian who has spent 25 years work-
ing with the animals he describes as
calm and clever. “We have 238 bison
now wandering the national park.”

,,“This, we think, is just the right
number to balance the elk, the moose,
the other animals and to protect the
plant life of this rare forest," he said.

ISolation Aided Survival

. Czeslaw Okolow is the senior scien-
tist and the curator of the museum in
this small community in the Bia-
Jowieza Forest national park. He was
born in the region and he regards the
protection of this nature preserve as a
personal and passionate mission.

: “We are one of 13 places in the
.world designated a world heritage
location by UNESCO, one of only two
in Europe, the other being the dormi—
:tor canyon in Yugoslavia,” Mr. Oko- '
.low said.

. 1; He went on to explain that because
-the forest was isolated for centuries
jas a game preserve for czars and be-
.fore them for Polish kings, the trees,
.shrubs, flowers and animals contain
:genetic material and strains that
‘have disappeared or have been di-
luted elsewhere as timber was cut or

forest turned into farmland.

“That is why the bison survived
here as long as they did after vanish-
ing everywhere else in Europe,” said
Mr. Okolow.

None Left by 1919

Images of the bison, a somewhat
larger animal with a more prominent

; hump than the American plains bison
j commonly called buffalo, have been

found etched in caves and on stones in j
many parts of Europe. The animals .
are believed to have died out in Eng- .

land in the llth century and in France
in the 14th. Just before World War I
5' there were only several hundred of

them in the Bialowieza preserve and

a smaller group in the Caucasus.

“The first World War marked the -

end of the czars and the end of bison
as well,” said Dr. Krasinski. The ani-

In 1923, an independent Poland,
‘ newly reborn after 125 years of im-
1perial partition, began an intema-
tional effort to breed new wild herds
from stock that had been given to zoos
and aristocrats, as had been done
with the plains buffalo in the United
States.

A number of the animals were
brought here but essentially, said Mr.
Okolow, all the bison wandering the
forest on this side of the fence that
marks the Soviet border and a like
number on the Soviet side are de-
scendents of one bull namedBorusse
and two cows named Biscaya and Bi-
serta.

Patronage of Goring

The Polish and Soviet herds, which
are of similar size, have had no con-
tact with each other since the fence
was put up shortly after the Soviet
Union acquired the Eastern portions
of prewar Poland, including half of
the Bialowieza reserve.

This was not the first time that
political and economic geography af-
fected the fate of Bialowieza’s bison.

At first they thrived because the-

czar’s retainers could enforce ukases
prohibiting farming around the pre-
serve, an oasis of Norway spruce, oak

and tall pines. Then the animals per-‘

ished in war.

In the years before World War II,

Hermann Goring, Hitler’s second in
command, came to know of the bison
when he hunted in the Polish park,
and during the war, when the region
was occupied by the Nazis, he ex-

tended his patronage to the bison
herd. At the “end of the war, there
' were 44 bison in the forest; 23 animals
had been killed in fighting.

Hay Put Out in Winter

Tanks and mortars altered the for- i

est and the czarist castle burned to
the ground. Since then, the bison,
watched over by a staff of naturalists,
have grown in numbers.

The 20 matriarchial herds spend

nse forest. In winters they congre-
ggte in clearings where park rangers
leave hay. This is done to prevent:
damage to trees, whose bark the
bison would feed on if there was no
haThere are hardly any wolves and, ‘1,
without predators, the number of
bison is growing very quickly, so

i

the right to shoot one.

The animals are not timid nor are
they quick and elusive. To a non- .
hunter they seem about as hard to hit
as a pickup truck with four flat tires.
There are records of hunting parties
in which Csar Alexander and his wife ‘

shot 30 bison as beaters chased them .

yBut if the forest has suffered dam—
aged in great cataclysmic events
such as war and changing borders, it
has been spared much of the ravages

. of industrial progress and modernity.

“Naturally, we can’t put the whole
park under a glass dome and nature
itself is dynamic,” said Mr. Okolow,
pointing to the welter of thick fallen
branches that dotted the landscape.
“We had a catastrophic event last
week when heavy wet snow fell, and
there was no wind to blow it off the
trees. The weight of the snow simply
tore big healthy branches off trees.
No one can recall anything like this.”

The snowfall was an example of a
sudden change, but Mr. Okolow also
aso noted slower change, such as the
proliferation and spread of an animal
known as the raccoon dog. This beast,
which originally inhabited parts of
Mongolia, was hunted for its fur in the
1930’s, specifically for jackets for
Soviet airmen. The animal, which
looks something like a fox, was intro-
duced into forests far from its origi-
nal home and has now spread
throughout Europe, where it has be-
come a major pest and disease carri-
er.

“People think that in a primeval
forest, time stands still,” said Mr.

At 35, Raphael is the'staff veterinarian at the Dallas

her medical knowledge of exotic animals. .

Among her regular patients are more celebrities than a

blood samples from the feisty 4-pound primates, ran TB
tests, dental exams and checked for intestinal bacteria.
X-rays help her assess each monkey’s heart and lungs.

' As a matter of survival, Raphael has cultivated an im-
peccable bedside manner. It’s little wonder why. She’d
pay dearly if she caused a patient such as Rosco, a 3,500—

pound black rhinoceros, any personal offense.

As Raphael climbed into Rosco’s‘pen one recent after-

noon, she sounded like a doting
mother attending to a child’s
skinned knee. . .

“Hey, son, they say your foot 5
sore,” Raphael said in a voice as
smooth as honey.

Like a Swedish masseuse, she
gingerly poked and kneaded Ros-
co’s ponderous hind foot while a
zoo keeper scratched the rhino‘s
back with an industrial scrub
brush. All this attention was more
7 than Rosco could endure standing
. up. He obligingly lay down on his
’ side, shut his eyes and seemed
' ready to purr like a pussycat. “

' “He likes my tender ﬁngers.

' mused Raphael as she searched for
an abscess or some other'injury
that might explain why zoo keep-
ers had earlier observed Rosco
limping badly. “You’re such a good
boy. Yes, you are." '

From this endangered black rhi-
no, Raphael continued her rounds.
moving next to an assembly of gi-
raffes. Without going into their
pen, her eyes moved over each ani-
mal, checking for any sign of ill-
ness, injury or unusual behavior.

“This is Bonnie," she said, paus-
ing to watch an elderly giraffe.
“She is old -—— 33 or 34 ——-. and real
arthritic. Her lower joints are really
slowing down on her.”

This day Bonnie looked OK, and
so Raphael continued on her
rounds. .

“These are gmy hippos — lit-
tle sausages on .zegs." she observed
cheerfully, stopping in front of
three small hippos who eyed her
suspiciously and seemed ready to
charge. “That's Toots, Boo and
P00. Are you going to show off and
come down and threaten us?"

Rambling through the 200. she
later looked in on. Cape buffalo and
flamingos, klipspringers and
orangutans. , "

It is her job to keep the zoos

sible. reproducing. Often, Raphael
. must work by instinct, led only by
,. careful observation and commrr
sense. Medical research pertainxig
._ to many of the animals is scant and

for many others there are no refer—

ence material at all to consult in
' time of illness.
“Sometimes it's a challenge. a

v

, little bit like the blind leading the

blind,” she commented, as she sat
hunched over a microscope, study-
ing the blood of a rare suni ante—
lope. “But, on the other hand, they
all are living creatures and alike in
that they have blood or some kind
of biochemical system.”

Her days are often as motley as
the creatures in the 200. One mom-
ing may require her to perform
surgery on a reptile while in the
afternoon she might have to spend
several hours vaccinating baboons.
The wall calendar in her tiny clinic
is a clutter of appointments with
bison, addax, gorillas and large
cats.

The constant flux of a zoo vet’s
life is its own vexation and reward.
She is on call 24 hours a day and
her work is never done.

“But. then, there's always some-
thing new. and that‘s what what
keeps me going,” she adds. “Some-
times I’ll do things that have never
been done before, like removing a
[diseased] kidney from a Blair’s-
King snake.”

When the 200‘s small herd of
suni, miniature antelope indige—
nous to Southeast Africa, were
stricken two weeks ago with an
epidemic of pneumonia, Raphael
had to drop nearly everything else.
Three of 20 sunis died in one week,
reducing the size of the herd by 15
percent. She began administering a
series of antibiotics and the experi-

mental drug interferon to help the ‘

rest of these rare creatures, which
are the size of poodles with pencil-
thin legs, fight off illness. The
strategr seems to be working.

Raphael says she recognized ear-
ly in her life what was her chosen
course.

“Sometime when I was about 5
years old and wewere taking our
boxer to the vets, I said, ‘Gee, I
want to be a vet,’ ” she recalls. Her
parents were supportive and she
eventually earned her degree in
veterinary medicine from Michi-
gan State University. After several
years of ordinary private practice.
she began her focus on exotic
animals.

Then, in 1981, she was chosen to
become the Dallas Zoo's first full-
time veterinarian, Working togeth-
er. Raphael and a cadre of profes
sionally trained zoo curators have

mal management at the zoo. One
srgnof these advances is that the
survival rate of newly born zoo ani-
mals jumped from 25 to 75 percent
during the founyear period. be-
tween 1979 and 1983.
In addition, Raphael has extend-
. the 200’s involvement with a va~
riety of research programs, includ-
ing an embryo-transplant project
to help bolster the declining

populations of rare and endan-
gered animals. .

. Like other general medical prac-
titioners who follow their patients
from cradle to grave, Raphael ad-
ministers to the 200’s animals from

On this recent afternoon, amid
appointments with antelopes and a
‘ rhinoceros, she also performed a

‘more solemn medical procedure:
She euthanized two terminally ill
snakes -— one a New Guinea Death

council OKs loan

By Kathy Zimmerman
The Tribune

I: 1':- 1;}

The Knowland Park Zoo will be forced to shut down if the
city council does not approve a $60, 000 loan to enable the
nonprofit East Oakland facility to stay Open through June; the

zoo s Operators have warned.

r‘;.f

The city council’s four- member Budget, Finance and Au-
dit Committee will consider today a loan request for the zoo,
listed among 10 of the worst 1n the country 2 1/2 years ago by the

Humane Society of the United
States

In October, the council ap-
proved a $433,000 bailout pack-
age after the operators, the East
Bay Zoological Society, project-
ed a $368,780 deficit by July 1.
Most of that money, however,
was earmarked for capital im-
provements with .only $120,000
designated for Operating expen—
ses.

City staff has recommended
the council grant a $60,000 loan
from the city’s Emergency Con-
tingency Fund, calling it “cru-
cial if the zoo is to survive” until
a new budget year begins July 1.

The zoo society has said it will
repay the loan in September if
good weather helps paid attend-
ance

Some council members, in-

cluding Mayor Lionel Wilson and '

Carter Gilmore, who sit on the
budget committee, in the past
balked at bailing out the zoo.

‘ Both Gilmore and Wilson, who
blamed poor management for
the 200’s financial woes, were
not at the October meeting at
which the council approved the
financial aid package.

Zoo General Manager Joel
Parrott could not be reached for
comment. In the past, however,
zoo backers have said the city
shares responsibility for the
problems for failing to give the
zoo adequate financial support.

Last week, the mayor voted
against giving $81,000 to the
school district to fund a tutorial
program, saying the emergency
fund, which currently holds
about $544,000, is “dangerously
low” for a city the size of Oak-
land.

Even though the Operators say
the loan will be repaid in Sep-
tember, the money in the emer-
gency fund must last the city un-
til July 1, when it will be replen—
ished at the start of the 1986-87
budget year.

“I think they’re going to have
a problem getting the loan,” Gil-
more said. “I would be very,
very reluctant to dip into that
fund anymore because it’s so
low.

“I’m not pleased with the zoo
anyway. They have a lot of man-
agement problems. The way it
has been Operated, it has not
been valuable to the city.”

Wilson could not be reached
for comment.

Zoo Operators say they need
the $60,000 loan to cover reve-
nue losses suffered last month

due to rain and increased operat-
ing expenses. Insurance alone in-
creased $30,000 this year, ac-
cording to city officials.

In October the city council set
up a $120, 000 contingency fund-
for the zoo, allowing the Opera-
tors to use it as needed. The city
also authorized the use of $66, -

000, previously reserved for-1
street repairs at Knowland -
Park, to repair the giraffe house
and to fund a new exhibit for the
ocelots. '

The council also agreed to al-1-
low the 200 to charge admission ,
fees to generate about $20,000 in 3
additional income. The new fees, I
however, were not implemented
until December.

A&M's p

Director believes
fears, 'suspicions

have been allayed

By HAROLD SCARLETI‘
Post Environment Writer

 

With about 150 parrots — most
of them large macaws —, screech-
ing and screaming, it sounds like
a trapical jungle.

But it’s really a grove of Texas
scrub oaks near College Station,
and it’s now home to this colony
of lively, intelligent, gaudily col-
ored birds from Bolivia.

The raucous macaws also
touched off quite a commotion in
certain human circles when they
reached Texas in April 1983,
caught up in a trouble-tossed
project that was co—sponsored by
Texas A&M University.

Suspicious environmental
groups charged that the birds’
, capture had caused huge casual-
ties in Bolivia’s dwindling ﬂocks
of wild parrots. They also voiced
fears A&M was being used in a
private money-making venture
aimed at importing thousands of
the valuable birds for the pet
trade.

The project sponsors admitted
their agent in Bolivia had failed
to care properly for some cap-
tured birds. But they said most of
the environmentalists’ fears were
a result of misinformation and
misunderstandings.

Dr. Benny Gallaway, a princi-
pal in the project who is himself
an ecological consultant, believes
those fears have been allayed.

The macaws have adapted well
to their Texas home, Gallaway
said, and after some rough early
going the parrot project is now
gaining stability and starting to
fulfill its intended goals.

Those goals are to provide
A&M’s College of Veterinary
Medicine with exotic birds for
teaching and research, and to

promote widespread captive
breeding of parrots to relieve the
pet-trade pressure from endan-
gered wild populations.

That pressure, Gallaway calcu-
lates, results in the death of three
to 10 parrots for every one that
reaches the United States.

The parrots -— seven different
species of macaws —— are housed
in clusters of indoor and outdoor
cages on the wooded, 45-acre

country place where Gallaway

lives with his wife, Nancy.

“This is now the largest collec-
tion of privately owned macaws
in the United States, with the pos-
sible exception of the Busch Gar-
dens aviary in Tampa,” he said.

In pet shops, the parrots would
bring prices ranging from about
$350 for a small yellow-collared
macaw to $3,000 or so for a large
scarlet or hyacinth macaw.

Showing a visitor around,
Gallaway handed unshelled brazil
nuts to two female hyacinth ma-
caws named (before they were
sex-tested) Ralph and Sparkles.

With their powerful beaks, the
bluish-purple birds cracked open
the nuts, delicately ate the
meats, then resumed nuzzling
each other.

“If anyone wants to donate two
male hyacinths,” Gallaway said,
“we have, as you can see, two
very receptive females for them.”

arrot project taking off

Later, in an outside cage, two
paired-off hyacinth maCaws were
carrying on a peculiar, gargly
conversation. Gallaway identified
it as mating talk.

“They’re saying something
like, ‘Are you interested?’ and
‘No, I’ve got a headache,’ ” he
explained.

After the stress of the long trip
from South America, then getting
acclimated to Texas, then moving
from their too-small country re-
treat to the present place, the
parrot colony recently produced
its first three chicks. The
Gallaways are hoping for 10 or 15
baby parrots by year’s end.

Through births, purchases and
donations of no-longer-wanted
parrots, the Gallaways hope to
build the colony up to about 250
birds.

At that point, Gallaway said,
they may occasionally sell excess
birds to selected individuals to
help pay the expenses of keeping
the colony.

He said the parrot project, con-

trary to the suspicions of some,

was never intended for large-
scale commercial sales of ma—
caws to the pet trade.

It was designed, Gallaway
said, to ‘determine and dissemi-
nate the best methods for breed-
ing captive birds on a broad scale
— even by individual parrot own-
ers — in order to relieve the pres-
sure on wild ﬂocks.

The parrot project started out
as a joint idea of Nancy
Gallaway’s father, G.T. McAlpin
— a retired Cuero oilman who
grew fond of parrots during sever-
al years he spent in Latin Ameri-
ca — and Dr. C.D. Brown, an
A&M veterinary professor who
died before the project got very
far.

Dr. Ian Tizard, who took
Brown’s place and heads the de-
partment of microbiology and
parasitology at the vet school,
says the care of exotic birds is
now the moSt rapidly growing
field in veterinary medicine.

Court should cut throug

WASHINGTON -_ It happens with depressing
frequency. Every party to a lawsuit has a re-
spectable position. No party is willing to find a
compromise position. In a dense fog of principle
and precedent, the key issue disappears. This is
what has happened to 15 research monkeys who
deserve a break that the law won’t give them.

The story begins in 1981, when Montgomery
County police raided the laboratories of the Insti-
tute of Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Md.
Police were acting on a complaint that monkeys
had been mistreated. The raid led to the arrest,
trial and conviction of the institute’s principal
researcher, Dr. Edward Taub. His conviction was
overturned on a technical point. Under. court or-

complete the study for which they were ac-
quired. But common sense suggests that unless
further “deafferentation” is contemplated the
primates may be observed just as well in Texas
as in the apparatus of some “appropriate” lab.
Frankie Trull, executive director of the Na-
tional Association for Biomedical Research, has
written me to protest that “this case is not about
15 monkeys and the quality or lack of quality of
care in a single laboratory.” But that is exactly
what this case is about. The 4th US. Circuit is
not passing on the future of animal research. The
legal question may be one of the plaintiffs’
“standing,” but the object is to let these monkeys
live in peace. Why can’t a just court cut through

  fog and free

monkeys

der the monkeys were transferred to the Nationé
al Institutes of Health (NIH) for temporary cus-
tody at an animal facility in Poolesville, Md.
Nearly five years later they are still there.
According to evidence at Taub’s trial, the an-
imals had been subjected to woeful mistreat-
ment. The object of Taub’s research, intended to
aid stroke victims, was to discover if a monkey,
deprived of the use of a limb, could be trained to
regenerate the limb. Operations were performed
in which the nerves of arms or legs were sev-
ered. The procedure is called “deafferentation.”

the fog and let the monkeys go?—(c1986.)

35-3

Taub says the animals suffered no pain, but the
jury obviously didn’t believe it.

Following the reversal of Taub’s conviction,
on the grounds that Maryland law did not apply
to animals in federally funded research, a group
called PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals) brought suit in US. District Court.
They sought a court order that would transfer
the surviving monkeys from Poolesville to a pri-
mate sanctuary near San Antonio. The District
Court held that PETA had no standing to sue.
That ruling was appealed to the 4th US. Circuit
where argument was heard two weeks ago.

There the matter stands. Prestigious medical
societies have leaped into the litigation to pre-
vent the transfer. They have filed a brief review-
ing contributions to human welfare resulting
from animal experiments. Because of such re-
search, they say, 11 million diabetics iead nor-
mal lives with the aid of insulin. Such research
has prevented the deaths of 30,000 victims of po-
lio each year. If animal research is subject to
challenge from humane societies, they fear scien-
tists will be so “intimidated” by the prospect of
lawsuits that they will abandon their careers.

Orphaned seal’s chance of survival

improving, aquarium caretakers say

United Press International

BOSTON —- An orphaned harbor seal pup
found on a road in Maine and rushed to the
seal nursery at the New England Aquarium
is “bright, alert and responsive” and has a 75
percent chance of surviving.

The 14-pound female pup, named Titania
after a moon of Uranus, is being fed diluted
formula through a tube inserted in her throat
and showing signs of im rovement, caretak-
ers at the aquarium said ate Thursday.

“She has started swimming, and she’s
bright, alert and responsive,” said Karen
Fronckowiak, an animal keeper at the aquar-
ium. “She’s not a healthy animal. The things
she’s been doing are good signs, but there
still is a guarded prognosis.”

Titania, who was found near the side of a
road in Sullivan, Maine, by an unidentified
man, was initially given a 50 percent chance
of survival when she arrived at the aquarium
Wednesday night. Ms. Fronckowiak said the
pup now has a 75 percent chance of making

 

it to adulthood. ,

The pup, which Ms. Fronckowiak said is
about 5- to 7-days-old, is 6 pounds below the
normal birth weight of a harbor seal and
probably was born premature.

Aquarium workers h0pe Titania will
grow strong and healthy enough to someday
be released in the wild.

The man who found Titania did not know
what to do with her, so he took her to Patri-
cia Pinkham in Bangor, Maine. Ms. Pinkham
fed the pup a formula used for abandoned
dogs and cats, then sought advice from
Maine fish and game officials, who contacted
the New England Aquarium.

The aquarium’s animal care unit includes
a special holding facility for stranded baby
seals, complete with a little pool area and a
heated grate for cozy lounging.

Harbor seal pups are found stranded
most often in New Hampshire and Maine
during the pupping season from mid-May to
the beginning of June.

Injured dog;

frOm bandits

Wounded in the leg,
the dog was credited
’for sending 3 would—

i

, MIAMI (AP) — A Doberman
ipinscher shot in the leg by armed
robbers still managed to chase the
Ethree would-be bandits away from
its North Dade home and family, po-
lice said. ' '

“She stopped the home inva-
sion,” said Tommy Robson, Metro-
Dade Police robbery detective.
“That family would have been
nailed if it weren’t for the dog.”

The would-be robbers were

scared away Thursday by Pepe, a fe-
male Doberman that the family,
who asked not to be identified, had
owned for eight years.
_ Robson said the burglary attempt
occurred about 9:30 pm. Thursday
when the father of the house re-
turned from work. He left the door
open as he stopped to pat Pepe on
the head and moments later was
confronted by three masked and
armed men. '

But before the owner of the
home could move, the dog lunged at
3 the robbers.

f One shot the dog in the right rear
leg, but Pepe kept barking, howling
and growling at the men.

“The robbers bailed out of there
real quick,” Robson said. “They
probably couldn’t believe it.”

The dog was rushed to the Emer-
= gency Animal Clinic in Miami where
her shattered leg was treated, Dr.
Andrew Mozlin said.

“The family told us that Pepe
was not an attack dog,” Robson said.
“She was just a docile pet who was
trying to protect her family.

Re:Veal

In my opinion, Examiner food editor
Jim Wood needs to find a recipe that con-
tains a dash of sensitivity and awareness. In
his article in the April 6 issue [Wood on
Food: “Vealing Fine”] Mr. Wood states,
“Good veal is a distinctive, very pale pink,

ﬁve to twelve weeks old, fed mostly on
milk.” What he forgot to mention was the
inhumane method used to raise “good veal.”
and the health hazard eating it poses. For
about ﬁfteen weeks, newborn veal calves are
chained in crates without straw bedding or
adequate room to stretch or recline comfort-
ably. Because of their confinement and lack
of exercise calves suffer from respiratory
diseases. Their diet consists only of skim
milk laced with antibiotics and growth stim-
ulants. The Food and Drug Administration
warns that one out of every ten calves con-

 

tains dangerously high, illegal levels of peni-
cillin, tetracycline and other drugs.
I urge consumers to boycott veal.
Vickie H arker
El Verano

“Vealing Fine” doesn’t make nutritional
sense. It misleads by saying that “veal has
almost no fat.” Even the leanest veal is ten
percent fat and provides 9.4 grams of fat per
three-ounce serving. A similar serving of
chicken supplies four grams of fat (white
meat) and ﬁsh a mere one gram.

Furthermore, scaloppine is not “perfect
for sensible, low-fat eating.” The recipe in
the article (made with butter) supplies 21
grams of fat, with half of it saturated—the
kind that raises blood cholesterol. The Gin-
ger Veal is worse yet, with the addition of
cream making a whopping 32 grams of fat
per serving. Considering that current guide-
lines suggest we limit our fat intake to less
than 50 to 70 grams a day, this veal dish is
not “exceptionally healthy.”

which means that it comes from a calf about

 

Jim Wood responds: I deplore, as
does Vickie Harker (and others
who wrote similar letters), the E u—
' . ropean veal-raising system in
which calves are conﬁned in a box, never al-
lowed to see daylight,force—fed only a milk
formula and loaded with antibiotics.
Thanks to the Humane Society of the Unit-
ed States and other animal protection
groups, this system has been thoroughly ex-
posed and appears to be headed for the
scrap heap. A rough estimate by USDA re-
gional director Dr. William Carter is that
less than ﬁve percent of the veal calves in
the United States are raised in this manner.
This system is being replaced by more hu—
mane methods, such as one in which calves
are kept in groups of twenty to 30 in a large
straw-lined pen An automatic mi lk-dis—
pensing machine permits the calves to drink
at will. Straw is available for roughage; the
calves are free to walk around the pen

Light pink veal, as called for in my col-
umn, is likely to come from one of these hu—
mane raising methods. If the veal your
butcher offers is pure white, you should ask
him or her how it was raised.

As for Darlene Dreon, she is correct in
pointing out that veal contains more fat
than ﬁsh or the white meat of chicken
However, compared to other red meats, veal
is low in fat. Exactly how she ﬂ gured the
calories and fat in the scaloppine recipe is a
little unclear—the recipe calls for the scal-
oppine to be cooked in butter and for the
pan to be deglazed to make a light sauce
only after the cooking butter has been
poured out. F ontina cheese was included in
the recipe as an option I think readers un-
derstand that adding cheese, or cream-
based sauces as in Ginger Veal, will, of
course, increase calories and fat in a dish.

SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER - May 11, 1986

Anyone for veni

By Mary Each
ASSOCIATED PRESS ’

MILLBROOK, NY. — On a
windy hillside above their home,
Eliot and Susanne Clarke are sur-
rounded by broad-antlered stags
and wide-eyed does, some spotted,
some russet or smoky with fat,
white bellies, all jostling for their
morning ration of corn. _

“Hello, Bighorn,” calls Susanne
Clarke, scattering kernels as some
150 goat—sized fallow deer crowd
around. “Here, Moosenose.”

Although they are docile and cu-
rious, following the Clarkes around
the field like a pack of puppies, the
deer are not pets.

They are livestock, meat on the
hoof, cattle for the calorie-counter,
the health-conscious, the gourmet.

By Eliot Clarke’s calculations,
and those of a small but growing
number of other American deer
farmers, they are money in the
bank. ‘

Raising deer for slaughter is big
business in West Germany, New
Zealand and Britain, where venison
is a common food. But it’s new in
the United States.

The Clarkes, and a few others in
upstate New York where farmland
is plentiful and major metropolitan
markets are close, expect U.S. de.
mand for venison to soar as the
tasty, lean meat is promoted by
chefs. diet centers and importers.

They plan to be ready to supply
the meat as well as the breeding
stock for other farmers they expect
to get into the business.

“Everyone says venison is the
meat of the future,“ said Eliot
Clarke, surveying the rocky fields
and wooded ravines of his BOOacre
Hudson Valley farm.

“It's only 3 percent fat, it is very
low in cholesterol, and it‘s one of

 

the few agricultural products
where the demand exceeds the sup-
Ply."

“it’s one of the more economical

 

forms of farming." he said.

“There’s almost no labor. It takes
20 minutes a day to feed them -—
corn, hay and some horse grain ——
and once a year we round them up,
give them their shots, separate the
bucks from the does.”

“Our competition is mainly from
New Zealand,” said Josef Von
Kerckerinck, who says he has the
largest deer farm in North Ameri- 5
ca. He raised more than 1,000 ani- l
mals last year on 600 acres of his
5,000acre Lucky Star Ranch in

 

*"_"I

Chaumont, near Watertown and
the Canadian border.

In New Zealand. where the gov-
ernment promotes the business,

g“;— —

 

there are nearly 2,000 deer farmers.
They sell mostly to Germany, which
claims the world‘s highest annual

per-capita consumption of venison

 

at more than a pound per person.
Frozen New Zealand meat is also
the main source of venison for
American restaurants. ,

“But in New Zealand, they raise
red deer, which originally were
raised for their antlers for the aph-
rodisiac market," von Kerckerinck
said. He said his fallow deer taste
better. ‘

Von Kerckerinck founded the
North American Deer Farmers As-
sociation to help others, like the
Clarkes, start deer farms. There are
only 10 members now, but he noted
that the New Zealand Deer Associa-
tion, of which he is also a member,
has grown from 12 to 1,200 mem-
bers in nine years.

Von Kerckerinck grew up in a
West German castle. complete with
moat. which had been in the family
for 500 years. He worked at bank-
ing. advertising and beef cattle
farming before he came to the
United States to raise deer in 1978.

Eliot. Clarke. who traces his an-
cestors to the Mayflower, is a Har-
vard Business School graduate and
a former senior vice president of
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. Su-
sanne Clarke was in the White
House press office under Presi-
dents Nixon and Ford. They live in
a 1758 Flemishstyle mansion fur-

 

nished with elegant antiques aha
trophies from African safaris. "‘

They say that compared to other
types of agriculture, deer farming
requires a relatively modest capital
investment, and little overhead and
labor. The economics are far more

, attractive than raising cattle, hogs-{-
3 es or sheep.

“You can run deer On a small

Visit Joshua’s Home,

The Knoxville

In 1971, Guy L. Smith III and his family
decided that their pet, Joshua, was becom-
ing too large to live in their quiet Knox-
ville, Tennessee, suburb. And his playful
gestures and leaps into trees were poten-
tially damaging—to family members and
trees alike.

So, it was decided, reluctantly, that
Joshua would have to move. A 200-
pound lion cub deﬁnitely needed more—
and different—space.

The logical lodging, of course, was the
local zoo. After all, Joshua’s parents,
Romeo and Juliet, were there. And he’d
be close to the Smiths who had come
to regard him as an important part of
the family.

“The little menagerie we called a zoo in
Knoxville was really deplorable at that
point,” recalls Smith, who had purchased
Joshua there just a year before. “It had
three employees and about 47 animals.
There wasn’t even a refrigerator or cooler
to store meat to feed them.”

But it would be a way of keeping
Joshua nearby.

The story could stop here, but it doesn’t.
Today, the Knoxville Zoo is home to a
fully grown Joshua and some 1,200 other
animals. The 200’s Species Survival Pro-
gram ensures a future for many endan—
gered lines. And a staff of over 55
top-notch people is on hand to ensure the
success of both the zoo and its ob jectives—

among the concerned personnel is the
200’s executive director, Guy Smith III.

The road from his job as sales manager
at a Knoxville television station to head of
a world-respected zoo is recounted in
Smith’s new book, A House for Joshua
(see “Books About the South” on page
132). But it boils down to one word: com-
passion. “Did you know that the world is
losing one plant or animal species a day?”
asks Smith, who traded in his three-piece
suit for comfortable khaki pants and ﬂan—
nel shirt. “With the tremendous explosion
in world population, there’s less room for
animals to live as they have for genera-
tions. We have to do something.”

The ﬁrst step was improving the Knox-

Marr‘h lQRG 35

 




 

ville Zoo. Your stroll through the rolling
80-acre facility strikes a different tone than
zoos of years past. First, there are few
traditional cages. The eight Siberian tigers
move with ﬂuid strides among the trees
and rocks of an area that looks like the
wilds of Africa except for a sturdy but
understated high metal netting that deﬁnes
their space. Decks for observers hang over
the tigers’ habitat, but the animals don’t
come face-to-face with folks who’ve come
to watch them. Nearby, the lions are en-
couraged to play their “king of beasts” role
in a regally rustic environment. Not far off,
the trafﬁc rushes by on I—40, and, right
in the park itself, a miniature railroad
provides visitors a quick glance at the
whole layout. But the animals don’t seem
to notice.

“These animals sense through their feet,
not their ears,” says Smith. “The environ-
ment here is built on rocks to cushion
outside noises. We treat each animal as an
individual. Each of the tigers, for instance,
has a distinct personality—and a name.
Talking harshly can hurt their feelings.
Our enclosures for the animals are large
enough that they can get off by them-
selves. We’re very strict, too, about not
allowing harassment from zoo visitors.
With proper diet, proper space, and no
stress, we have theoptimum conditions
for breeding.”

And breeding is exactly what this zoo—-
like so many others around the world——is
all about under Smith’s conscientious care.
“The number of animals we have here
changes daily,” he says. “And that’s cause
to celebrate. Naturally, we look toward
perpetuating the endangered species—like
our Asian lions, lesser pandas, and Si-
berian tigers.” .

And the 200’s African lion, not yet on
the endangered list, is already cause for
concern. “Approximately 10 years ago,
there were 1,200,000 of these animals in
the world—now there are approximately
180,000. At this rate, they will be endan-
gered in another 10 years.”

But the Knoxville Zoo is already using
its “founder stock” of lions to breed more
so that the ominous 10—year mark may

never realize the threat to this species.

It all sounds so serious and scientiﬁc.
But what you see at the Knoxville Zoo is a
series of animals who are loved by the staff
and the local citizens. There’s a Big Cat
Collection—with the lions, tigers, and
their relatives—and the internationally
recognized Reptile Collection, showing off
its residents in stylish modular cubicles.
The Papuan python is safely behind its
glass, fascinating even if you don’t read the
marker that identiﬁes it as the only such
species in capitivity. There are chimps,
white rhinos, California sea lions, and, on
the African Plains—a dusty vista with
rocky plateaus—the giraffes, zebras, os-
triches, and elands. You can also visit the
kangaroos, mute swans, the Indian gaur,
or the petting zoo.

And elephants. Despite the story of Jo-
shua’s success in ﬁnding a home, and the
active international propagation program,
it’s the elephants that have engraved this
facility in zoological history. And there’s
one in particular.

Her name is Little Diamond, produced
early on a March morning in 1978, by
proud mother, Toto, and father, Dia~
mond, one of the 200’s earliest residents.
Now weighing in at approximately 2,500
pounds, Little Diamond was the ﬁrst
African elephant to be born in capitivity
in this hemisphere.

Today, Guy L. Smith III stands back
and surveys the zoo with a contented sigh.
“You know, the zoo has grown all because
of an initial effort to ensure the comfort of
one African lion,” he admits. “But now
there’s so much more. Zoos used to exist
solely for the entertainment of visitors—
but we feel we can educate, too, and still
be entertaining. And it must be working—
did you know that more people attend
zoos every year than organized sport-
ing events?”

 

The Knoxville Zoo is open year-round.
Winter hours (effective through March)
are 10 am. to 4:30 pm. daily. Admission
is charged. For more information, contact

Poaching " war hOrns in

on another

By Erik Eckholm

- New York Times News Service

The black rhinoceros, already an
endangered species, is under attack
by heavily armed poachers in one
of its last sanctuaries. Officials in
Zimbabwe say they have shot and
killed nine illegal hunters there
since June.

The area, the Zambezi valley in
northeast Zimbabwe, had until last
year escaped the severe ”poaching
that has reduced the world’s black
rhinoceros population by more
than 90 percent in just 15 years.

“It’s a bush war,” said Glen
Tatham, a Zimbabwe park war-
den, in an interview. He is in New
York to raise funds for field radi-
os, motorboats, backpacks and
other antipoaching equipment.

“For the rhinos, the situation is
desperate,” Tatham said.

About 750 black rhinoceroses,
the largest intact group left in
Africa, roam the Zambezi valley,
an uninhabited area of 4,000
square miles.

“This population is of very great
importance for the species,” said
Jaques Bemey of the Convention
on International Trade in En:
dangered Species in Lausanne,
Switzerland. 1 . .

On a morning early in 1985, six
of the animals were killed in ﬁve
hours. By the end of the year offi-
cials had discovered 73 hornless
carcasses and estimated that per-
haps another 15 lay undiscovered.

‘.‘We never dreamed the threat
would reach those proportions,”
Tatham said. “Overnight it be-
came a cn'sis, and since then it has
been a real battle.”

Armed patrols have been in-
creased, some including former
guerrillas from Zimbabwe’s war of
iberation from white rule. Prison
terms for captured poachers were
lengthened to 11 years. But de-
spite the new measures, so far in
1986 another 15 mutilated rhino-
ceros carcasses have been found.

The hunters kill the animals for
their horns, which sell fOr thou-

 

rhino keep

sands of dollars each in North
Yemen for use in dagger handles.
Ground-up horns command hun-
dreds of dollars a pound in Asian
traditional medicines.

Despite an international ban on
the horn trade, rhinoceroses have
declined rapidly throughout Africa
at the hands of organized gangs,

- according to international experts.

‘ In 1970, an estimated 65,000
lived in Africa. Conservationists
"focused their concern on the
southern white rhinoceros, a dif-
ferent species that had nearly dis-

appeared but has since been re-'

stored to a few thousand through
intensive efforts in several coun-
tries. ' 9'
The alarm about black rhino-
ceroses was raised in earnest in
1980, when experts discovered
that the total had fallen to about
15,000. But the slaughter has con-
tinued. Today only about 4,500
remain, according to specialists
with the International Union for
the Conservation of Nature, based
in Gland, Switzerland._

 

1 he rhinoceroses ot the Zambezi
valley had not beenhunted for
decades and, in some areas fre-
quented by tourists, the animals
had lost their shyness, making
them eas prey. . , .

Since ghe beginning of 1985,
Zimbabwean guards reported
having shot and killed nine
poachers who were armed With
high caliber hunting rifles. Car-
tidge magazines from AK-47 auto-
matic weapons have also been
found. Another eight poachers
have been captured and sent to
prison.

Some Zambian legislators have
expressed outrage over the
shooting of their countrymen.

“To kill a man for shooting an
animal is a very delicate matter in
Africa,” Tatham, the Zimbabwe
warden, acknowledged. But he
added that the leaders of both
Zimbabwe and Zambia have pub-.

licly supported the policy of

 

shooting armed poachers.

Puppets enliven news of Lowry Park Zoo

 

By JANE SEEGAL
Tribune Staff Writer

In the Twin Lakes Elementary School lunch-
room, one teacher turned to another, looking
'weary, and asked, “Have you practiced? You
don’t know your otter song? We have practiced
and practiced.” '

A colleague intoned to several children,
“Put your legs down. Don’t play with your hair.
Move over here, Adam.”

The fidgeting stopped and a brief, awed
hush took over Tuesday morning as a two-foot-
tall, ﬂuffy brown puppet appeared on stage, fol-
lowed by Betty Greenwood. Olly the Otter, the
Lowry Park Zoo spokespuppet, and Greenwood,
the puppeteer/ventriloquist, were there to sell
some 200 younger children at the northwest
Tampa school on the zoo and conservation.

, The 45-minute program was one of five
being tried out in Tampa elementary schools

this month in advance of a more extensive pro-
gram next year. Mixed with entertainment pro-
V1ded by four puppets and Greenwood was in-
formation about the animals’ behavior, habitats
and appetites.
You could tell the children were listening
because they responded with “oohs” and
yucks” when Olly, a river otter, asked for eels
and worms to eat. Or when Olly remarked on
how strangely people laughed; they laughed.
Olly, who seemed to move or gesture like
the 200’s real otters, Clyde and Sugar Bear,

taught the importance of avoiding water pollu-
tion. Otters can’t survive in dirty rivers because
their fur loses its insulating quality and the
mammals die of exposure, Zoo Curator \Clar-
ence Wright explained later.

Rachel the Raccoon, who eats out of gar-

'bage cans at night, explained that drink cans

left about with sharp edges and small openings
can harm her.

T.J., a boy from the audience, helped feed
Matilda the chimpanzee imaginary milk out of a
milk bottle.

Seven other kindergarten, first grade and
educationally mentally handicapped children
arrived on stage to help sing the otter song —— a
second time.

There were moments of wit such as when
Jolly Roger, the mangy but brightly colored pi-
rate parrot, turned to Greenwood, who had just
set up the next scene with a question she likely
always uses.

The parrot” said, “Si” in response, following
the script. (He’s from Central America.) Then
he continued quizzically, “You know that. Why
do you pretend you don’t know?” -

Teachers are given materials to supplement
the lessons taught in the program. The teachers
and the zoo officials said the scheme works

well, arousing the students’ interest.

her only son, she says she looked to
Mother Nature for many important
parenting tips.

In the wilds of Tanzania’s Gombe
Stream Nature Preserve, Goodall
found her child—rearing textbook.
There, among the feral chimpanzees
she has studied for the last 26 years,
she learned about motherhood.

But the lessons his mother, one of
the world’s most renowned experts
on primates, learned during her ex-

periences in nature have spurred~

Goodall to make a number of pro-
vocative observations about the be-
haviorial dangers to children when
the Western nuclear family is dis-
rupted by divorce, grueling parental
work schedules and other modern
social pressures.

and Africa and present a public lec-
ture at Southern Methodist Univer-
sity about her research.

During a daylong visit to the Dal-
las Zoo, one of 10 American zoos
that participate in the “Chimpan-
Zoo” research project studying the

, behavior of chimps in captivity,

Goodall took time out from a storm
of activities for a wide-ranging inter-
View.

Chimpanzees bear some striking
resemblances to man — and not
just in their antic behavior, the 52-

year-old Goodall

noted. Chimps

closely resemble

their upright-

walking relatives

in their vocal

mannerisms, use

of objects as tools,

male dominance

in society and the

turbulence of ado-

lescence, she said.

In recent years,

the correlation be-

tween chimpanzee

and human par-

enting has become

a subject of special

interest to her. In

chimps, as in peo-

ple, it is crucial

that the infant have a stable up-

bringing. Indeed, the chimp’s rela—

tionship with its mother seems to be

of crucial importance in determin-

ing what kind of adult it will be—

cOme. (In chimp society, there are

no father-child relationships be-

cause the males are promiscuous,

mating with many different fe-

males. Consequently, it’s usually

impossible to know which male fa-
thered which infant.)

“It’s become increasingly clear
that disturbances in childhood in

monkeys, apes and chimps at
Gombe tend to leave scars in the
youngsters that are apparent in
adult behavior ” said Goodall.
“If an infant [chimp] is not com-
pletely secure as a child . . . when
it grows up it is less able to form
really meaningful and relaxed rela-
tionships with other adults. If this
kind of thing is going to be true for
humans, too, then clearly it is very,
very important.”

Goodall’s work among the wild
chimps at Gombe has resulted in
two popular books, countless arti-
cles and several National Geo-
graphic television specials — all of
which have bestowed on her a rare
kind of celebrity. As she inspected
the primate collection Friday at the
Dallas Zoo, throngs of people gath-
ered, eager to watch her watch the
monkeys.

 




Despite her fame among conser-
vationists and much of the public,
Goodall is a woman without airs or
pretension. She continues to dress
casually and wear her graying hair
pulled back in a simple ponytail.
Having recently convalesced from
a bout with malaria, she looked
tired but remained spirited in her
conversation.

“We need our children to be able
to form meaningful bonds with a
few others, to understand the
meaning of trust and to also be giv-
en guidelines ” she observed.
“We have learned from the chimps
that a certain amount of discipline
is also important for the future
well-being of the child.”

To illustrate her point, she relat-
ed the story of a female chimp
named F10, who neglected to ween
her second-to-last child, a chimp
called Flint. Never disciplined,
Flint became spoiled and abnor-
mally dependent on his mother.
When Flo died, the adult Flint was
unable to survive and died several
weeks later.

Taking to heart such examples
from nature, Goodall says she
made a point of spending at least
half of each day in a loving but dis—

" ciplined atmosphere with her own
son — now in his late teens —— for
_ the ﬁrst six years of his life. As a
result, he has grown into a well-
adjusted independent person, she
says, despite friends’ warnings that
he would become doting and de-
pendent because he spent so much
time with his mother.

“Many people have said, ‘You
were really lucky. You could have
your career and your son,’ ” Goo—
dall recalled. “Well, it’s not actual-
1y true. Until he was 6 . . . I didn’t
follow chimps [in the wild], the
thing I like to do best. But I feel we
must be responsible for our chil-
dren. They are tomorrow’s world

and it is a very, very important and -

responsible job — to see that your
children are properly raised.”

Many of Goodall’s observations
about child rearing sound down-
right old-fashioned. But her studies
in nature have stirred her concerns
for what she sees happening to the
Western nuclear family, which is
increasingly strained by divorce,
the need for both parents to work
and other social pressures. In re-
_ cent years, Goodall has begun to
speak and write about these issues,
even proposing some social
changes that she feels would help
support many modern families.

Among her thoughts:

I Universities should become
more ﬂexible in designing curricu-
lums that would allow women with
children to study at home.

I Working parents with the ﬁ-
nancial wherewithal might consid-
er hiring a nanny or grandmother—
ly ﬁgure who could serve as a kind
of surrogate parent and help raise
the child in a stable atmosphere.

“Couldn’t we reintroduce the
nanny at a well-paid and high-sta-
tus position? Maybe we could call
her something else and let people
write her off their income tax,”
suggested Goodall. “This would be
a contribution of the state toward
raising the children of tomorrow.”
I Government should help subsi-
dize day-care centers ——- especially
for the poor ——- to ensure that in-
fants of low- and middle-income
working parents grow up in a sta—

ble environment.

Goodall’s current interests em-_

brace a wide range of subjects and
issues. She launched the Chimpan-
Zoo project a year ago to involve
American zoos and universities in
her research. Each year, she said,
she receives hundreds of letters
from students who want to work
with her in Gombe. But she
stopped accepting students at her
Gombe Stream Research Center in
the 19703, shortly after terrorist
threats.

The ChimpanZoo project trains
volunteers in this country to ob4

serve chimps in captivity, so that
their behaviors can be compared
with chimpanzees in the wild. One
beneﬁcial offshoot of the project,
which she said has gotten off to a
good start in Dallas and other zoos,
is better living conditions for the
primates.

In the past many zoos have kept
their primates caged in tiny con-
crete cells. Now, zoos such as Dal-
' las’ are building larger habitats and
ﬁlling them with plants, trees and
other objects from the animals’

natural habitats.

The humane treatment of pri-
mates and other animals is a keen
concern for Goodall. She acknowl-
edges that animals are essential in
many kinds of experimental re-
search, but she contends that many
labs treat the animals cruelly, often
performing unnecessary and repet—
itive experiments.

“If we are going to use animals
[in scientiﬁc experimentation] and
if we feel that it’s justiﬁed because
of the alleviation of human suffer—
ing, then we owe it to those ani-
mals that they should be kept in
the best possible conditions, and
they are not . . .” insisted Goodall.
“What we’re doing to the animals
is barbaric, absolutely barbaric.

“It’s very egocentric to use all
the animals who share the world
with us to our own good,” she ob-
served. “It is really torture from
the animals’ point of view, isn’t it?
We’re really torturing them.”

She complained bitterly, for in-
stance, about experimentation on
rabbits and other animals used for
the development 'of cosmetics and
other non-essential commodities.
In one typical experiment, she
said, new cosmetics formulas are
dripped into the eyes of rabbits to
project how irritating they might
be to a human’s eyes.

“Using rabbits to test women’s
makeup, this is barbaric,” she said.

“What right do we have to take a
rabbit and use it to test something
to beautify ourselves?”

The solution, Goodall says, lies
in greater use of computers and

other technologl to better analyze
and test new products before sub-
mitting animals to painful labora-
tory experiments.

“I think this [computer analysis]
is the path of the future,” she said.
“This is what animal rights grOups
should be looking into, rather than
militancy. Being militant doesn’t
get you anywhere. It just damages
your cause.”

Her cause, she says, continues to
be primates. Literally half her life
has been devoted to studying
Gombe’s wild chimps, an accom-
plishment that has established her
research as the longest unbroken
ﬁeld study of ‘a group of animals in
their natural habitat. When Goo-
dall first trekked into the forests of
Tanzania, she was a 26lyear-old
Cambridge University graduate
student with a plan to stay for
three years in the wilds.

“I can still remember vividly the
moment when I suddenly realized
there wasn’t any need to stop [her
research] . . . ” Goodall recalled
while in Dallas. “1 was climbing
the mountains and I was having to
pack up the next day to go back to
Cambridge. I was doing my Ph.D.
and I suddenly thought, ‘Why can’t
it go on and on and on forever.’ ”

More than two decades later, her
work among the wild chimps of
Gombe continues. And, she says, it
will for as long as she is able.

Those who wish to contribute to Goodall's
primate studies can do so through the
Dallas 200 by writing to 621 E. Clarendon,
Dallas, Texas 75203. Checks should be
made out to “Jane Goodall Research."

BABY Johnny poked his furry black head and electric pop-
out eyes from behind his mother’s body, where he had
entwined himself in wee lemur fashion. The head and tufted
ears, giving the appearance of Dr. Seuss’ Grinch, came out
from under his mother’s armpit.

His mother, Crystal, age 12, was born wild in Madagascar,
the home of the lemurs, an island about 250 miles off the ‘
African coast in Indian Ocean. She was making alarmed-
maternal lemur sounds at the approach of human primates,
including a photographer. She and her offspring are black
lemurs, primeval cousins of apes and monkeys, called
prosimians, meaning “before monkeys.”

Crystal made a gutteral sound, followed by a clicking noise.
Then she swayed uneasily and sniffed at the bars. At that
point, Baby Johnny melded into his mother’s body, a patch of
shiny black fur wrapped around Crystal’s light-brown coat.

Down the corridor from the black lemur’s holding cage, the
red-ruffed lemurs were setting up a deafening squeal, a sound
that ricocheted throughout the Primate House; it is typical
red-ruffed lemur talk.

“Crystal’s so nervous because she hasn’t had successful
births before,” said Roger Birkel, general curator for the St.
Louis Zoo. He suggested everyone ease back from the holding
cage behind the glass-enclosed lemur display area in the
Primate House.

“We even had to take the father away. And Johnny’s twin is
in the nursery at the Children’s Zoo. Crystal just couldn’t
handle it; it’s quite a drain for a female that old.”

Indeed it must have been. Twin births for black lemurs are
rather uncommon, occurring only about 10 percent of the
time; the momentous event took place in St. Louis on March
22.

The other twin, whom keepers have named Kenny after
country singer Kenny Rogers, spends his days in the nursery
in the company of another hyperactive child, a DeBrazza’s
Guenon monkey; the monkey’s mother is also too old to care
for it. Kenny rolls about in his playpen with a strip of security
blanket, which the little lemur uses in moments of stress as a
surrogate mother. Kenny can just about roll up and disappear
in the security blanket.

“We like to have them together,” said Birkel. “It’s important
for primates to socialize.”

(The country music theme carries throughout this lemur
family — the mother is named for Crystal Gayle and baby
Johnnv for Johnnv Cash.) -

(a

The largest captive population of lemurs is found at the St.‘
Louis Zoo. The Zoo also keeps the stud book for black-lemur
breeding projects for the entire world, thereby controlling
which black lemur is bred to which. .

' It is an important activity, because lemurs are among the
most endangered of all creatures and valuable to scientists
because of their isolated island origins; they are a true
evolutionary link. , .

That’s why scientists such as Birkel and Washington
University anthropologist Robert W. Sussman find lemurs
particularly fascinating. The physical and behavorial makeup
of lemurs reflects the early stages of primates —— a step along
the evolutionary road to apes and monkeys and even man.
The study of lemurs, therefore, is a way of better
understanding the higher order of primate social systems,
including the likes of Birkel and Sussman themselves.

Lemurs are so hard to find in what’s left of the jungles and
rain forests of Madagascar that virtually nothing is known of
their behavior in the wild. “So much of what we’ve learned
about them is based on captive studies,” Birkel said.

There are 22 different species of lemurs in Madagascar,
and four of these varied types are on display in the Primate
House here — the black, of course, the ring-tailed, black—and-
white-ruffed and the red-ruffed lemurs. The two ruffed kinds
are almost identical except for coloring and as a result are
considered subspecies. Ten of these species, including the
black and ruffed lemurs, have not been studied in the wild at
a .

Meanwhile, the ring-tailed lemurs, which are found in
southern Madagascar, are the most numerous species in
captivity. The St. Louis Zoo has a large troop. In lemur
fashion, they spring from surface to surface — bank, the ring-
tailed moves from one rock surface to another, straight up
and over.

When female ring-tails move about, their elegant black-
and-white tails are held high in the air, and their offspring
ride on their backs like tiny jockeys. Some research in the
wild has been done on this species, and scientists were
surprised to find that they travel over land, unlike other
lemurs, who spend most of their time in-the trees.

- These four types of lemurs show, in dramatic fashion the
considerable physical differences between the species, in

color, size and appearance. Lemurs appear to run the gamut.
Of the 22 species, the lesser mouse lemur, which indeed looks
like a furry mouse, is one of the world’s smallest primates.
Generally, the lesser mouse weighs 2 ounces and grows no
more than 5 inches. At the other end are lemurs as large as a
St. Bernard. ‘ , ,

This is typical of Madagascar, where the plants, vegetation
and weather also vary from region to region.

That lemurs are so unusual is fitting in the natural-history
scheme of things. The island they come from is cloaked in ,
geologic mystery. It began, reseachers believe, as part of the
African continent. Then millions of years ago, an elongated

' chunk slightly smaller than Texas — roughly 1,000 miles long

and 250 miles wide — broke off from Africa and shifted more
than 200 miles out into the Indian Ocean, taking with it flora
and fauna and animal life found in Africa eons ago.

“To many biologists, it is the single most important place in
the world,” said Sussman. He noted that 3 percent of the
world’s plant population is found only on Madagascar.

Because of its isolation, the living things of Madagascar

evolved without the competitive pres-
sures of the African continent. Le-
murs would have few enemies in the
wild because of the absence of large
predators on Madagascar, except for
man. Until 2,000 years ago, Madagas-
car was covered with forests: a humid
coastal strip along the eastern shore,
verdant and fertile valleys in the pla-
teaus and mountains of the center,
with a wider coastal band along the
west. And everywhere there were
lemurs.

With the arrival of man about 300

to 400 years before the birth of

Christ, in the form of a Malayan-Indo-
nesian people, the physical face of
Madagascar began to change. Over
the centuries, slash-and-burn farming
methods gradually wiped out more
than 90 percent of the woodlands,
leaving great chunks of the island
barren and eroded.

And as the forests went, so did the
lemurs. Today, they are among the
rarest of the world’s wild mammals.

As far back as the late 19505, when
few zoos were displaying lemurs, the
St. Louis 200 imported its first black
females, followed shortly thereafter
by a male, the beginnings of one of
the most successful lemur breeding
programs anywhere. In 20 years, 75
lemurs were born at the Zoo.

Black lemurs are the most distinc-
tive species when it comes to the col-
oration of the sexes. The males, like
Johnny and Kenny, have fur that is

glossy black. Females like Crystal
ranges from a light brown to a deep
chestnut, with white ear tufts.

In Madagascar, black lemurs are
found in a small area in the north-
western part of the island, and on two
small nearby islands, Nosy Be’ and
Nosy Komba. The blacks have not

been studied in the wild since the

early 19605, so no one knows their

status. Obviously, breeding programs

such as the one under way at the Zoo
have in mind the possible restocking
of the species in the remaining wood-
lands of Madagascar.

This is fitting, too, because three St.
Louis institutions are involved in re-
search and conservation efforts in
Madagascar. Shaw’s Garden has
maintained a study post on the island
as part of its worldwide rain-forest
research program. And now Robert
Sussman, graduate coordinator for
Washington University’s anthropolo-
gy department, will be off to the is-

land in December of this year. He

would like Birkel to go with him.

Sussman and his wife, Linda, a
medical anthropologist whose spe-
cialty is ethnomedicine, will spend a
year on the island. Washington, Yale
and Madagascar universities are in-
volved in a joint study program there,
working in a special reserve estab-
lished by the Democratic Republic of
Madagascar, a revolutionary govern-
ment that until recent years had been
decidedly inhospitable to Western na-
tions and institutions.

Madagascar became a French col-
any in 1896 and was given its inde-
pendence in June 1960. After a coup
in 1972, the Democratic Republic na-
tionalized French interests and
closed French bases and the United
States’ space tracking station. It be-
camecozy with the People’s Republic
of China and embarked on such re-
pressive measures as frequent arrests
and the expulsion of foreigners and
Western embassies.

In 1981, the official attitude
changed. “They’re going out of their
way to cooperate,” said Sussman.

As a result, scientists like Sussman
and Birkel long for new scientific in-
quiry and hope to help the endan-
gered plants and animals of Madagas-
car. Sussman will begin work at the
2,000-hectare (a hectare is equal to
2.471 acres) national reserve on his
arrival in December. The reserve
will soon be expanded to 8,000
hectares.

In his year in Madagascar, Suss-
man will be involved in trapping and
marking wild lemurs, something that
has never been done with the most
primitive of the world’s primates.

“It’s almost like the opening of Af-
rica in the 18905 — no one has been
in there,” he said.

And for St. Louis lemurs like Crys-
tal and her twins Johnny and Kenny,
it may mean that their distant cousins
will continue to live in places outside

ZOOS.

% Dance company

Iimns the lemurs

HE Mid America Dance Company paid leaping
tribute this past weekend to the lemur.
Premiere performances of the dance “Lemurs,”

g billed as “Ross Winter’s Preposterous Parade of

l'

Primordial Primates,” took place at Washington
University’s Edison Theatre on Saturday and
Sunday. Six dancers from the touring modern
dance company took-the stage in tights, gas masks

' and hoods with tufted ears and brought to life
’1 Winter’s dreams for a 20-minute dance dedicated

:‘y "$31; ~

to the prosimian he has grown to love. Another

‘ performance of the lemur dance will be given at

Southern Illinois University at Edwardsv'ille at 8
pm. on Friday, May 30. -

Winter, an Australian, is also mindful that such a
dance will bring added attention to the plight of
lemurs in Madagascar, where these primitive
primates thrived without significant competitors or
predators for 6.0 million years, until man came
along. >

Winter, artistic director and co-founder of the
touring company, got the idea for choreographing
a dance about lemurs after he saw a wildlife
television special about the animals.

“The way they moved was a choreographic
inspiration,” he said.

Getting his dancers to see it that way, however,
was another matter, said Winter. When he told
them abouthis idea, their reaction was far from
enthusiastic. _

“ ‘Oh, ugh, yuck, you want us to be animals?’
they said. Dancers always want to be graceful. So I
shelved it for the following year. This year I said,
‘Damn it, I’m going to do it.’ ”

The dancers are more enthusiastic now, said
Winter. “If it’s not a total disaster, it will go into our

. Attendance cut forecast

By JOHN GRAVOIS
Post Reporter

 

Many Houston ‘Zoo loVers al-
ready are growling over pro-
posed admission fees of up to $3,
and even city officials are saying
they expect attendance to be cut
30 percent or more as a result.

“I probably wouldn’t come if
they charged,” says Jan Ed-
wards, who enjoys bringing her
14-month-old
son Joey to

the zoo.
“This is
about the

only free
thing we
have to do,”
she says. .3

‘ ‘ I think " j “-5
it’s a terri-
ble idea,” K .
agrees Ber- "
nadette OLSON:
Cole, who Parks chief
now makes frequent trips to the
zoo. “I think it’s going to alienate
the public. Having a free 200 is
one of the great things about this
city.”

Both Mayor Kathy Whitmire
and Parks Director Don Olson
said they are sympathetic to zoo
lovers’ concerns.

Whitmire said the zoo fee “is
not one that We wanted to pro-
pose.”

“We’ve been very proud to
have a free zoo all these years,”
the mayor said.

Olson predicted the admission
fees would lead to a decrease in
zoo attendance of “30 percent or
better” from the 2 million visi-
tors last year.

Whitmire and Olson said Hous-
ton has been one of only a few
cities with no entry charge to its
zoo.

A Houston Post survey of zoos
around the nation shows charges
ranging from $1 to $7.95. Chica-
go’s Lincoln Park Zoo and the
main section of the St. Louis Zoo
have free admissions.

 

   

      

Whitmire’s fee proposal calls
for a $3 charge for people 18 and
older, $1.50 for youths 12 to 17
and 50 cents for children 3 to 11.
Senior citizens will be charged $2
and toddlers 2 and under would
get in free.

The fees are expected to net

‘ the city about $1.5 million a year,

even with reduced attendance.
Tuesdays and Thursdays will
be free days. Olson said that will
allow schools to continue bring-
ing students to the zoo and will
ensure that people won’t be
turned away solely because they
can’t afford to pay the fee.
“Very few zoos have free

. days,” he said.

Under Whitmire’s proposal,
revenues generated from the fees

97,“:

-um

 

will be pumped back into 200 and
park improvements.

Regardless of the city’s budget
situation, frequent zoo patron
Mary McLatchie said she be-

, lieves no admission should be
; charged. “We pay property taxes
; and we ought to get something

for it,” she says.

David and Debora Petrash,
who bring their two pre-school
sons, Pete and Patrick, to the zoo
regularly, questioned the timing
of the proposal.

“Just look at all the layoffs all
over —- these are tough times for
people around here,” said David
Petrash. “I can understand that
they need to charge something,
but they need limitations.”

His wife said there could be a
positive side to the charges as
long as the receipts really “go to
improve the 200.” But, she said,
“if it goes just to help the tax
situation, I ‘don’t know if I like
it.”

Beatrice Sias, another regular
zoo Visitor, echoed the concerns
over charging admission during
an economic downturn.

“I hate the idea,” she said.
“With so many people not work-
ing, they won’t be able to come
to the zoo any more, and that’s
going to be bad for the kids.”

Her husband, Ralph Sias,
agreed, saying that if admission
is charged, “We just couldn’t af-
ford to come as much as we do
now. I guess we’d just have to
find something else to do.”

Councilman Dale Gorczynski,
the father of two young children
who like to go to the zoo, said he
shares those concerns.

“As a family man, I would
have to look at the effect it would
have on my family finances.
Maybe we wouldn’t be able to go

_ as often,” he said.

“Looking at it as a political
matter, I think we need to do
everything possible to avoid a
zoo fee. Right now I’m opposed
to the idea,” he said.

Although lots of people are
saying they’d cut back or elimi-
nate their zoo visits, Councilman
John Goodner said he doesn’t be-
lieve attendance would be hurt.

“There’s a heck of a lot of peo-
ple out there that don’t go to the
200 now that might if there was a
charge,” he said.

“These people tell me that
when they go out there, there’s
hordes of uncontrolled kids” who
show little appreciation for the
exhibits and ruin the fun for ev-
eryone, Goodner explained.

“That may be the worst rea-
soning in the world, I don’t
know,” he said. “But these peo-
ple believe a charge might weed
out people who go out there and
don’t really appreciate things.”

MEMPHIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL - May 14, 1986

New Zoo birdman
makes lofty plans
for avian exhibit

The new assistant curator
of birds at the Memphis Zoo
says he wants to create lush,
tropical exhibits that are
“more an ecological system
than a cage for birds.”

Herbert Roberts, 37, who
began regular duties yester-
day, said: “I’d like you to be
able to walk up to the exhib-
its and feel like you’re going
to see Tarzan swinging
through the trees.”

Roberts, who has worked
in zoos for 12 years, succeeds
John Stokes, who left Mem-
phis in January. Stokes was
famous for his work with
hawks and eagles, but Ro-
berts is more interested in
the colorful birds of the tro-
pics.

He said his love of birds be-
gan when he was a boy grow-
ing up in rural Arkansas and
Missouri. His “natural inter-
est in wildlife and aversion to
work” led him to become a
sort of amateur Audubon.

“Whenever I could get
away from the house — as
much to avoid chores as any-
thing - I’d get out and walk
along the creek beds. I’d sit
for hours and watch native
birds do what they do.”

At the Memphis Zoo, he
said, “I’d like the public to see
the birds interacting in a
more natural environment.”
An Inca tern in one of the
bird houses’ open-air exhib-
its darted about behind Ro-

berts as he spoke. The bird
made several passesover a
small pond, swooped down
and plucked out a live min-
now, and swallowed it.

“See, that’s the kind of be-
havior I mean,” he said, add-
ing that these exhibits could
provide roosting and nesting
sites for many more birds if
they were
lusher, more tropical plants,
including ﬂowering vines.

Roberts has worked at the
Knoxville Zoo and the Little
Rock Zoo, where he started a
new deparment of birds from
“what was a random collec-
tion.”

During his career, he has
been in charge of hoofed ani-
mals, carnivores and pri-
mates, and has worked exten-
sively with softbill birds,
tropical birds and birds of
prey.

He even ran a pet shop at
one time, but made even less
money at that than working
in zoos. “I felt bad about sell-
ing birds to some people. If
you’re going to make money,
it’s bad to have a conscience
like that.”

Cliff Ross, curator of birds,
said there were 30 applicants
for the assistant curator’s po-
sition. He said Roberts got the
job because of “his general
overall knowledge of all
kinds of birds, and his exper-
ience with many aspects of
zoos.”

TUESDAY. JUNE 3, 1986

 

By Mike Toner

Selence/Medicme Editor

 

The recent discovery of two ivory~billed
woodpeckers in Cuba has rekindled a flick-
er of hope that the species, believed to
have vanished from this country more than
20 years ago, may yet survive in some re-
mote wooded reaches of the southeastern
United States.

Somewhere between South Carolina’s
Santee River and Texas’ Big Thicket, in
forgotten stands of undisturbed, old-growth
timber, some wildlife experts believe the
tinny “kent-kent-kent” of the elusive ivory-
billed woodpecker still echoes through the
forest understory.

The chances are thought to be slim. Al—
though there are scattered reports of ivory-
bills every year, there have been no con-
firmed sightings of the birds in the United
States for more than 30 years.

Despite the odds, the US. Fish and
Wildlife Service is gearing up for a five-
year search for the bird -— one last effort
to locate any members of the species that
may remain.

In part, the search is a formality — a
necessary step before the government le-
gally can strike the species from its list of
endangered species. In part, it is also an
act of sentimentality.

“We are 90 percent sure that the ivory-
billed woodpecker is gone, but the 10 per-
cent chance that remains is enough to keep
us from putting the nail in the coffin," says
Marshall Jones, chief of the endangered
species programs for the agency’s South-
eastern region.

“It may be too little, tooJate, but as
long as there is any chance, we owe it to
the species. This was a spectacular bird.
We can’t close the books on it without
making one last serious effort.”

Although always relatively rare, the
ivory-bill was once found throughout the
river and swamp hardwood forests of the
South from Arkansas and the Carolinas to
the Gulf Coast.

Because the woodpeckers fed almost
exclusively on the wood-boring grubs found
in old, recently dead trees, their demise
closely tracked the loss of the South’s vir-
gin timber.

. By the 19305, most ornithologists felt
that the species already was extinct — un-
til James Tanner discovered several of the
birds in northeast Louisiana. Tanner, him-

self an ornithologist, made his last sight--

ings of the birds in that region of the Unit-
ed States in 1941. '

In cooperation with outside experts, the
US. Fish and Wildlife Service now has
identified eight areas in South Carolina,
Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi,
Louisiana and Texas where there are still
large stands of old-growth timber that
might support a few of the birds.

Now retired from' the University of
Tennessee, Tanner thinks the current

search is destined to come up empty-hand-
ed.

“I’d be very surprised if they found
anything.” says Tanner. “The ivory-bill is a
conspicuous, fairly noisy bird. it’s hard for
me to believe that it could exist anywhere
in the South without having been discov-
ered.”

Other experts are more optimistic. Je-

_rome Jackson. professor of biological sci-

ence at Mississippi State University, says
other thorough searches have turned up
“extinct” species before, the most recent
being the black-footed ferret in Wyoming.
A milk crate full of “sighting reports"
on the floor of Jones’ Atlanta office attests
to the fact that many people still think
they are seeing ivory-billed woodpeckers.

10“

Most are cases of mistaken identity —
inexperienced “birders” and some experi-
enced ones who have confused the ivory.
bill, whose glossy black plumage has a
large, triangular white patch across the
back, with the smaller, more common pile-
ated woodpecker, whose back is entirely
black.

“My desk is littered with reports from
people who have seen big woodpeckers in
their back yard in Atlanta," says Jones.
“The reports demonstrate a terrific leyel of
public interest. but not one of them has ac-
tually turned out to be an ivory-bill."

Even so, Jones says there has been just
enough unconfirmed ”evidence” to keep
hopes alive.

In 1978, for instance, Dr. Robert Ham-
ilton, an ornithologist at Louisiana State
University, reported hearing the bird's call,
compared by some to the “tooting of a
child’s tin trumpet," in the Grand River
tract of Louisiana’s Atchafalaya basin.

Three years later Dr. Tom Michot, a
government biologist. recorded — on color
film — a distant view of a large red-crest-
ed bird perched in some tall trees in the
same area. The image of the bird, partly
obscured by foliage, is too small to be posi-
tively identified as'that of an ivory-bill, but
with the aid of National Aeronautics and
Space Administration computer-enhance-
ment techniques, the wildlife service hopes _
to have it enlarged.

Through direct appeals over the next
year to professionals in the field and in-
formed amateurs, Jones also h0pes to de-
velop a cadre of volunteers who will be
able to investigate areas where ivory-billed
woodpeckers might remain.

“We are going to have to rely heavily
on our volunteers,” he says. “We don't have
the budget for a strike force that can jump
in a private jet and go check out every re-
port we get.” ,

The rugged, remote character of the
woodpeckers’ preferred habitat is certain

‘to make reliable reports extremely diffi-

cult. Unless there is documented photo-
graphic or recorded evidence, a report is
considered “confirmed" only if there are
repeated sightings by more than one quali-
fied bird watcher.

Despite unconfirmed reports of ivory-
bills in Cuba‘s Guantanamo province for
more than a decade. for instance, it wasn‘t
until this April that the presence of the
birds was confirmed by Lester L. Short, the

American Museum of Natural History‘s

chairman of ornithology. -

Even after two years of preparation,
Short and the Cuban biologists accompany-
ing him got only a glimpse -— a fleeting
view of a male that flew across their path
while it was fleeing a crow. Before they
could photograph the bird, it had vanished
into the underbrush.

Another ivory-bill had been spotted by
the Cuban biologists three weeks earlier.

The Perils of Plastic Pollution

 

Cups, sandwich bags and other debris threaten marine life

iologist Stewart Fefer and three col-
leagues from the US. Fish and Wild-
life Service had eagerly anticipated their
assignment: a trip to Laysan, a 960-acre
island about 1,000 miles northwest of Ho-
nolulu. They were to study some of the 14
million seabirds that nest there, and they
looked forward to their stay on what they
assumed would be an island paradise with
pristine beaches. What they discovered
came as a shock. The sands of Laysan
were strewed with an unbelievable variety
of plastic trash. While doing his bird-
watching chores, Fefer cataloged thou-
sands of pellets as well as toy soldiers, dis-
posable lighters and one
toy Godzilla—~all made of
plastic. “This is one of the
most remote islands in the
world,” he says. “I expect—
ed it to be just idyllic.”
The debris that de-
spoiled Laysan’s beaches
had been washed ashore
by the waters of the Pacif—
ic, which like other oceans
is becoming increasingly
fouled by plastic ﬂotsam.
But while the ﬂoating and
beached plastic is unques—
tionably an eyesore, the
problem goes far beyond
aesthetics. At the Sixth
International Ocean Dis—
posal Symposium in Pa—
ciﬁc Grove, Calif., last
month, scientists reported
that plastic trash is caus-
ing injury and death to
countless marine animals
that feast on it or become
ensnared in it. Says Ecolo-
gist David Laist, of the
Marine Mammal Commission: “Plastics
may be as great a source of mortality
among marine mammals as oil spills,
heavy metals or other toxic materials.”
Prime contributors to the growing t1de
of plastic pollution are the world’s mer-
chant ships, which, according to a study
by the National Academy of Sciences,
dump at least 6.6 million tons of trash
overboard every year. Some 639,000 plas-
tic containers and bags are tossed into the
oceans every day. Commercial ﬁshermen
are also major offenders. Estimates of the
plastic ﬁshing gear lost or discarded at sea
every year range as high as 150,000 tons.
Boaters and beachgoers add to the marine
litter with six-pack yokes, picnic utensils,
9.55:1 :lwich bags and Styrofoam cups. Cities
t... hadustries discharging waste directly
into the water or dumping it at sea are also
to blame. On some East Coast beaches
near sewage outlets, so many plastic tam-

 

 

pon inserters have washed ashore that res-
idents refer to them as “beach whistles.”

Perhaps the most ubiquitous form of
plastic trash is the tiny polyethylene pel-
lets used in the manufacture of plastic
items. In one survey, researchers calculat-
ed that, on average, a square mile of the
Sargasso Sea, southeast of Florida, con-
tained between 8,000 and 10,000 bobbing
pellets. Says Al Pruter, a ﬁshery biologist
and partner in a Seattle-based natural-
resources consulting ﬁrm: “Almost with-
out exception, surveys show plastic to ac-
count for over one-half the man—made
products on the ocean surface.”

California sea ”lion caught' m the tangles of a gill net

Herring gull snared in a six-pack yoke
As great a source of m orta 1in as oil spills.

 

 

 

The plastic is taking a heavy toll on
marine life, particularly on seals, sea 1i-
ons, turtles and seabirds. By one estimate,
as many as 50,000 northern fur seals in
the Pribilof Islands die each year after be—
coming enshrouded in netting. “Young
seals get their heads or ﬂippers caught in
it,” says Laist. “Then they either become
exhausted from toting it or their ability to
catch food is restricted.”

Smaller plastic items are frequently
mistaken for prey by turtles and birds,
often with, fatal results. Leatherback
turtles, which feast on jellyﬁsh, are
particularly attracted to plastic bags.
Says University of Florida Zoologist Ar-
chie Carr, an authority on sea turtles:
“Any kind of ﬁlm or semitranslucent
material appears to look like jellyﬁsh to
them.” Trouble is, the bags—or other
plastic items like golf tees—can form a le-

thal plug in the turtle’s di-
gestive tract.
At least 42 species of
seabirds are known to
"i snack on plastic. Of 50 a1-
._ batrosses found ill or dead
‘ on the Midway Islands, 45
had eaten some form of
the substance. In several,
the plastic had either ob-
structed the digestive tract
or caused ulcers. Says
James Coe, program man-
ager for the Marine En-
tanglement Research Pro-
gram at the National
Marine Fisheries Service
in Seattle: “We have
found everything from toy
soldiers to pens, ﬁshing
bobbers and poker chips
in the birds‘ stomachs.”
A study of wedge-tailed
shearwaters, which breed
on central Paciﬁc islands,
showed that 60% of the
adults surveyed had in—
, gested plastic. Even sea
gulls, which are able to disgorge disagree-
able food, are not immune to the plastic
threat. They have been strangled by six-
pack yokes.

Efforts to reduce the amount of plastic
jettisoned into the oceans have been
largely unsuccessful. Although the US.
and 59 other nations agreed in 1972 to
outlaw the dumping of durable plastics,
among other substances, into the oceans,
the treaty failed to address the discharge
of ordinary garbage, which contains large
quantities of plastic items. Ten states are
trying to do their part; they have passed
legislation requiring that six-pack yokes
be made of treated plastic that degrades
rapidly in sunlight. Nonetheless. con-
cludes Zoologist Carr: “This junk is grow—
ing in abundance year by year. It is just
getting outrageous.” —By Jamie Murphy.

elephants. Completed in 1984, it

includes a 1.75—acre mating yard,

maternity pens, and special areas to

introduce the newborn calves into

the main herd. Ofﬁcials have great

plans for the successful mating of a

bull named Ranchipur and his

eight females, possibly as early as
next fall.

Since 1981, ﬁve African bush ele-

phants have been born at San Die-

go, and three survived.

The father, Chico,

caught in Zambia, had

smashed the door to

the elephant barn at a

previous zoo; another

time he had snared the

zoo director with his

trunk. But since Chi«

CO was given his own

expansive, grassy en-

; ~ closure where he

ah . ‘ could romp—and

mate-he has been
both manageable and
amorous.

world—comes from

the ci y of San Diego. Members and

visitors contribute the rest. Indeed,
some 120,000 households, most of
them in Southern California, take
out annual $45 memberships to
support the zoo and park. “Since

we don’t depend on government, .

we can pursue our own goals,” says
Betty Io Williams, president of the
nonproﬁt Zoological Society of San

Diego, the governing body for both
200 and park.

But why save a dangerous ele—
phant or a white rhinoceros or a
blue lory? Why not let them all go
the way of the passenger pigeon
and the dodo bird?

I put that question to Iohn Phil—
lips, who said he wouldn’t want to
show a picture book of tigers, ele—
phants, zebras and giraffes to his
children and have to tell them,
“Only a few short years ago these
animals wandered freely on the
face of the earth. Now they don’t
exist anymore.”

I asked the same question of Dr.
Charles Schroeder, the 84-year-old
veterinarian who served as director
of the San Diego Zoo from 1953 to
1972—and the man who conceived
the idea of the wild-animal park
and fought for its creation. He
grabbed me by the arm and made
me sit beside him on the monorail.
He didn’t speak, but now and then
during the hour-long trip he would
tap me on the shoulder and point to
some scene he was afraid I might
miss.

We saw an endangered Suma—
tran tiger padding from its lair. We
saw the rare okapi, with the body of
a zebra and the head of a giraffe,
which dwells in Zaire. We saw the
white-tailed gnu, which hasn’t ex-
isted in the wild for almost a hun—
dred years.

By the end of the journey I had
found the answer—reﬂected in the
awe and wonder I saw in Charles
Schroeder’s eyes. ##sstﬁt

physiologist at the 200’s Center for
the Reproduction of Endangered
Species, has ﬁgured out that some
animals favor a device that humans
like too—a water bed. It “serves as a
heat source,” he says. “Animals like
to build their nests on it.” The bed
has proved especially successful
with Chinese dholes, rare, wild, red
dogs from China. “In the past,”
says Phillips, “the dholes lost their
young through maternal neglect.
But with the water bed, they raised
the ﬁrst successful litter born in the

United States in 1983.”

The constant attempt is to dis-
cover the conditions animals prefer
in the wild-—and duplicate them in
captivity. Mandhla, a white rhinoc-
eros, lived for nine years at the zoo
without showing interest in his
mate. In 1971 he was moved into a
90—acre habitat at the park with a
group of white rhinos from South
Africa. Soon he began to woo every
female in sight and has since sired

56 offspring.

its newborn infant.

In many ways the park is a
peaceable kingdom where impalas,
waterbuck and even ferocious Cape
buffalo live together in harmony.
Nevertheless danger lurks—as Rich
Massena, chief of ﬁeld services,
knows all too well. One morning,
he drove out to check on the herd of
Przewalksi’s wild horses. There,
he found the stallion, Basil, vic—
iously attacking a newborn colt.
As Massena lifted , . ' t h e
colt into his arms,

bit and crushed his left forearm.

Massena regained the strength in
his arm, but the colt died. Why did
Basil kill it? Researchers ﬁnally
discovered that the leader ofa band
of mares will kill all newborn males
that aren’t his. The colt Basil killed
had been sired by a stallion in the
USSR. '

That information turned out to
be invaluable. Only about 600 of
these bay—colored horses from
Mongolia and China are left in the
world—all of them in zoos. Those
seeking to breed them want to save

their disputes amicably.” These en—
gaging animals are also endan—
gered: their native habitat, the deep
forest of Zaire, is being destroyed
by logging.

Seventeen pigmy chimps have
been born at San Diego, more than
at any other zoo in the world,
because they are allowed to live
in large social groups. That is essen—
tial since older offspring instruct

younger ones.

For example, 90 percent of the
lowland gorillas in captivity are
rejected by their mothers. Dolly,
one such gorilla from the Came—
roons, treated Iim, her ﬁrstborn, so
shabbily that his keepers had to
move him to an incubator. “If Dol-
ly had‘ grown up in the wild,”

Brockman says, “she would have
learned how to be a mother by
watching how older females care
for their young.”

The next time Dolly became
pregnant, an anthropology student
from San Diego State University
showed her, with a rag doll, how to
care for her forthcoming infant.
Using the prop, he discouraged
Dolly from banging the newborn
on its head or dangling it by its legs.
He showed her how to breast-feed.
When Binti was born, Dolly cra-
dled, groomed and nursed her.

There seems to be no limit to the
ingenuity of the zoo when it comes
to encouraging exotic animals to

breed. John Andrew Phillips, a

on ﬂicks his forked yellow

tongue as he crawls toward
me from his jungle lair. He stops
and stretches his eight—foot—long
leathery body. As he lifts his mas—

thick neck, powerful jaws and ser—
rated teeth. .

I’m mindful of his reputation
too. In his native habitat—Komodo

bush deer, pigs, even water buffalo,
often bringing them down with a
single, swift lunge. Fortunately,
I’m watching him in the sanctuary
of the San Diego Zoo.

The Komodo dragon, the largest
lizard in the world, was discovered
in 1910 by a research party ventur-
ing deep into other Indonesian is—

civilization has systematically threat-
ened its fragile habitat despite pro-
tective steps taken by the Indonesian
government. Only about 5000 are

sums up the dilemma: “The fate of
these dragons may hang on man’s
ability to plan for a future that
satisﬁes the needs of both.”

The Komodo dragon and the
roughly 300 other rare species of
mammals, birds and reptiles at the

city limits, and its Wild Animal
Park near Escondido, 30 miles to
the northeast, have a chance to beat

survival rate of the offspring for the

greater than in the wild.

Among the 3200 animals repre-

and plentiful zebras, lions, giraffes
and bears. But there are also snow

In addition, the zoo boasts one of
the largest subtropical and tropical
plant collections in North America.
Some 4500 species—many of them
priceless—aren’t there for orna-
mental value alone, but to surround
the animals with the vegetation of
native habitats. The zoo grows eu-
calyptus trees, for example, because
leaves from a few choice species are
the only food koalas eat. Australia
gave six of its gray, cuddly Queens-
land marsupials to the zoo in 1976.
Since then, 20 babies have been
born. Indeed, San Diego is the only
zoo in the United States to breed
them successfully.

LOS ANGELES TIMES Magazine - May 4, 1986

C arol Holmes’ first view
of 3-year-old Appaloo-
sa gelding Comrie Caprice
was of “pink eyes in a dark
stall, a scrawny tail and a
few white snowﬂakes on a
gangly black body.” Hardly
the show prospect she was
seeking for her young
daughter Kim. Yet, there
was something special
about him, she knew, be-
cause he came right over
and began licking her, thus
earning the name Killer in
that inexplicable custom
that dubs a fat person Tiny
or a tall one Shorty. But it’s
Killer’s tail this story is
about, not his name.

Four years later—in Oc-
tober, 1978—the hills of
Malibu were ravaged by a
fire that left the Holmeses’
White Cloud Ranch the on
1y thing standing for miles.
While the fire raged on all
sides, Killer, ridden by
then-16-year-old Kim, led
strings of younger horses to
relative safety. On the third
trip, an entire hillside ex-

Trial after trial, Killer (with Kim Holmes) came through, but always something was missing.

ploded into flames, and
Kim, frightened, jumped
off, leaving Killer to his
own devices. After what
seemed like an eternity,
Killer came limping through
the smoke, a branch run

through his left front leg,
patches of hair still smol-
dering and his tail burned
clear off.

When the smoke cleared,
his veterinarian discovered
that the branch had missed

 

Cow Palace, where he won four out of
five classes. A week after that, he went
to the World Championship Appaloo-
sa Show in Oklahoma City, where he
took championships in jumping and
negotiating trail obstacles and missed
winning the all-around champion-
ship by one point. All with no tail.
On his way home from that show,
Killer somehow got turned upside
down in the trailer, all four feet in the
air, and bloated up like a balloon. He
couldn’t be budged. A vet ﬂew in by
helicopter from more than a hundred
miles away and came running, not
with his black bag, but with a shot—
gun. But while waiting for the vet,
Holmes had gotten a tow truck to
come from a nearby garage. They had
attached chains to Killer’s legs, which
were protected by heavily padded
traveling boots, and hauled him out.
After brieﬂy walking Killer around,
Holmes loaded him back into the
trailer and continued. He ended up
with no damage other than a minor
cut over one eye, which swelled into
an enormous shiner. For the next
three days, as they traveled to a show
just below the Oregon border, Killer
alternately wore ice packs and beef-
steaks over his eye—and won high

all major arteries, tendons
and ligaments, leaving just
a nice, clean ho1e. Two
weeks later, Killer ap-
peared at a prestigious
show in San Francisco’s

point honors at the show, black eye,
burned-off tail and all.

One day, the Holmeses got a call
from a movie studio that needed a
horse for a TV movie about a dying
boy whose dying grandfather buys an
old broken-down horse for the boy to
care for. Killer, though, was neither
old nor broken down, so a makeup
artist drew in ribs and colored his hair
gray. Killer would relax his ears on
command, hang his head and drag his
feet, creating the pure pathos the role
required. Killer won the hearts of the
entire film crew with his clever tricks:
begging ice cream and lemon Popsi-
cles, even drinking soda by tipping a
cup in his teeth.

But back to the tail. Killer had long
been known on the show circuit by
his tail, or lack thereof. Just when it
had grown back, Killer, again on the
way to a show, kept switching that tail
in the face of the horse behind him.
That horse, tiring of Killer’s games,
bit through his tail to the bone, leav-
ing a three-inch stump. At the show,
the Holmeses borrowed a false tail,
but just as Killer was going into the
ring a bee landed on his rump and he

switched the tail with enough force
that it ﬂew off, landing at the judge’s
feet. Killer won the class anyway.
Killer’s 15 now. His tail will never
be beautiful by anyone’s standards,
but, then, it’s at the opposite end of
all the intelligence, personality and
courage, so who cares? D

Pet shrink Warren Eckstein Wantsto p‘ut‘the

 

By Maureen Dewney
Staff Writer ,

 

Even before introductions were complet-

ed, Warren Eckstein had cuddled Jessie and

nuzzled her nose in the “hugs and kisses” ap-
proach to animal behavior. that has made
him pet therapist to the stars.

Such heartfelt encounters between Eck-
stein and pets cost owners $125 an hour plus
expenses, his charge to see Spot, put him on
the couch and figure out his neurosis. The
price can rise as high as $400 for out-of-town
cases. The steep cost hasn’t hampered Eck-
stein, who operates a booming bicoastal busi-
ness and counts Lily Tomlin’s Norwich terri-
er, Tess, and Cheryl Tiegs’ wire~haired fox
terrier, Martini, among his clieri’ts.

But it was because of Stan and Bob, Da-
vid Letterman’s maladjusted mutts, that
Eckstein appearanced on “Late Night with
David Letterman.” Now Eckstein advances
his hugs and kisses phiIOSOphy every three
weeks as the in-house expert on “Hour Maga-
zrne.” T -

,The basis of Eckstein’s hugs and kisses
formula is that an animal should be reward-
ed with affection and not with food. “The one
time you don’t have a bribe handy to get
your Great Dane out of the middle of the
road could be the one time a truck is coming
right toward him,” Eckstein said. ~

Eckstein speaks to all the pressing social
issues of the ’805: latchkey Labradors, cats
and dogs of divorce, depressed Dobermans
and schnauzer schiZOphrenia. He’s also writ-
.ten two books, including “Understanding

Your Pet” (Holt, Rinehart and Winston,
‘ 1985). -

In Atlanta last week, the Bronx-born

Eckstein said his rapport with animals devel-
' oped in childhood. While in Vietnam in the

early ’703, Eckstein trained guard and bomb-
sniffing dogs for the Air Force. After his dis-
charge in 1973, Eckstein remained in EurOpe
and Asia and studied at zoos and circuses

‘and with animal breeders for two years.

Then he went home to Long Island, N Y.,

‘ the pet explosion — 60 percent of households

3 now have pets - and Eckstein’s media sav-
,- 'vy turned him into a sought-after commod-

» .ity. It was Eckstein whom People magazine

~ .—..-

called to comment on the portrayal of the.

' pet shrink who beseeches Mike the dog to eat '

in the movie “Down and Out in Beverly

Hills.” Even though the film spoofed his pro-

fession, Eckstein welcomed the publicity.

An animated 37-year-old with bas'set'
hound eyes, Eckstein grows even more excit-
ed when he discusses animal owners who be-
lieve their pets must be made to understand
who is boss. “There’s almost no way not to
make a pet neurotic when he’s bullied and.
bossed into submission,” Eckstein said.

The Leo Buscaglia of the four-footed set
said problems arise when owners don’t_talk

l
I

dogon his coucl I

' to their animals. So essential is communica-

tion that Eckstein and his wife, Fay, call
home while away on trips to talk to their

five dogs on the telephone answering ma-v

chine. “I say, ‘Hi, guys. There are some toys

for you upstairs. I’ll be home soon and we’ll

play soccer,’ ” Eckstein said. 7

Too many people limit conversations .-

with‘their pets to the command, “No,” Ecko
stein said. “I go into homes where people say
it so much, the dog comes because it thinks

"no’ is his name.”

Eckstein maintains that most behavioral
problems in animals can be traced to.the

 

family environment. “When I go
into a home that’s having a prob-
lem, I might even send the family
out of the room and talk to the ani-
mal alone,” Eckstein said. “All ego
A is removed. I look at the animal’s
*5 eyes, watch the body language and
' figure out what might have gone
wrong.” ~ ‘

Owners, especially those famil-
iar with Freud, won’t be surprised
to learn that they are probably to
blame for their dog’s quirks. In
most cases, boredom and a lack of
attention cauéc aberrant patterns,

~ Eckstein said.’ Chronic hole-digging
’ and chewing result when a dog is

 

 

‘ a cool place to sleep.”

, pet-raising sounds more like Dr.
’ Spock’s on child-rearing. especially
in the delicate area of dating after
divorce. “Sooner or later, your dog.
‘ or cat will see you kissing and hug-

setting. Divorce is hard, but it’s
no less hard on the pets involved.”

While people assume a dog left out-
side has plenty to do, it’s just as im-
portant to provide plenty of play-
things in the yard.

“You can attach an old tire to a
tree for your dog to bat around or a
light ball on a string for your cat,”
to said. “You can set up a barrel as

a hurdle for the cat or dog to jump
over and a bench to crawl under as

Eckstein said that just as people
weary of the same games, pets lose
interest in old toys. He recommends
several sets of play items that can
be rotated to sustain the animal’s
attention. A radio or television left
on will reassure a dog confined in-
side all day.

Two-income families pose spe-
cial problems for a pet because cou-
ples exhausted from work fail to
meet their pets’ needs, Eckstein
said. He advises devoting the first
15 minutes at home to the animal.
“As long as you react to his initial
excitement on seeing you, he’ll for- l
give the fact that you don’t have a
great deal of time right now to
play,” he said.

PET THERAPIST: Warren» Eckstein gives a cocker spaniel a nuzzle.

 




“They do have armed guards at
the entrances,” said Robert Baker, a
field investigator in the society’s
Washington office who once had a
gun pulled on him at a cockfight. He
added that dogfighting, a felony in
27 states, “is a much smaller and

much tighter fraternity —- and they '

will shoot.” . ~

Cockfighting, Baker said, has
long been popular in the Appala-
chian states. The gamecock is the
mascot of the University of South
Carolina. And cockfighting, he said,

is common in the Cajun country of .

Louisiana and among Hispanic peo.
ple in Miami, New York and Los
Angeles and in much of the South-
west. * - .

)'

Cockfights “are getting harder ‘

to infiltrate,” according to Baker.
“And one of our biggest problems in
preventing cockfighting is that law-
enforcement agents are reluctant to
move in on it, either because they
condone it, or they’re taking payoffs
from it, or it‘s just not a high priority
with them.”

- David Barrington, the sheriff of
Hoke County for 24 years, said he
Ordered the Saturday morning raid
after he was stung to discover that
the director of the State Bureau of
Investigation had received an anon-
.ymous letter complaining that a reg-
ular cockfighting derby was being
staged in Raeford by a promoter

who boasted that he had the sher-
iff’s permission.

. When all his deputies and a bor-
rowed tactical squad moved in on
the long shed, Barrington said, 15
men standing outside ran into the
woods. But inside, 206 people were
cheering and stamping on home-
made bleachers around a blood-
soaked .pit where two gamecocks
were fighting with sharp metal
= gaffs tied to their legs. 7

It is the gamecocks’ courage —
their “gameness” —— which breeders
and partisans say they so admire.

“I’ve seen both cocks blinded
and dying in the ring,” said Pat
Reese, who witnessed cockfights as
a boy in the mountains of western
North Carolina. And “the last one to
strike -- even though he doesn’t hit
the other one — is the winner. My
God, they’re brave.” '

Police raids exasperate cock-
fighting partisans, who say they are
respeCtable people who have been
driven into isolation by authorities

in ordento pursue their sport.

. "I know and have known a num-
._ber of preachers who raise game-
‘ fowl,” said Mary Hodge, the editor
and general manager of Grit and
‘ Steel, which was founded in 1899
and is the oldest continuously pub-
lished magazine devoted to the
gamecock. .
, Cockfighters are “out in the
woods in an isolated place,” Hodge
said. “They’re not bothering anyone
whatsoever. They’re not hurting
anyone.” The only casualties are the
roosters, she said, and “cocks have
no souls.”

he gamecock derby

here in Hoke County

was so well organized,

Barrin-gton said, that

printed schedules showed it

A being held every one or two
' Weeks thrOugh June.

Most of the people attending
that Saturday were from western
*North Carolina, South Carolina,
West Virginia or Ohio. The only
Hoke County residents on hand, he

said, were six American Indians,

managing the hot dog concession.

. A membership card in the
North Carolina breeders’, associa-
tion was necessary for entry, the
sheriff said, along with an admission
fee of $10. Owners who wished to

- enter their birds in fights paid an
entry fee of $300. Sheriff Barrington
said his deputies confiscated $12,400

‘in cash and found almost 75 dead

birds. =

Sheriff Hubert Stone of neigh-
boring Robeson County has raided

' two cockfight derbies in the last five
years. He said he thinks the sport is
growing, and that gambling is the

_ reason. “The betting has really got-
ten up high,” he said.

All 206 people arrested that Sat-
urday in Hoke County, including a
North Carolina state trooper, were
charged with misdemeanors. About
160 of them appeared for their ar-
raignments. Most were fined $200

,each and given suspended sen-

t-tences. _;.

. The ones who did not show up.
BarringtOn said, will probably come
in when they have enough money to
pay the fine. But if they do not, he

said, he plans to seek the extradition ’

of those from out of state.

. Because the crimes charged are
misdemeanors, extradition will re-
quire the approval of both North

. Carolina’s governor and the gover~
nors of the other states, he said, but
A he expects no problem.

. “Neither governor's going to

»- disapprove of it,” the sheriff said,

“because those Humane Society peo-
ple are really on you all the time.”

Animal Experiments

. Missouri is one of the major suppliers of
ianimals for research. Many animal experi-‘
:ments are redundant; some are so absurd
€that they have little (if any) relationship to
l human welfare. The abuse of animal life and
waste of tax money is incredible. Thirteen
l institutions in the St. Louis area are licensed
gby the US. Department of Agriculture as
‘animal research facilities. Alternatives are
available and are used in Europe.

5 An incomplete survey recently taken by
:Animal Friends indicates that more than
3 50,000 animals were killed by St. Louis area
5 pounds and shelters last year. This figure
i; does not include animals destroyed at birth
ior abandoned or sold to research establish-
, ments. More than 100,000 animals, for which
there are no homes, are born into this com-
. munity each year. Cruelty, neglect and use
, as experimental subjects are natural out-
comes of so many unwanted animals.

 

 

Shelters and pounds must require a “paid
in full” receipt for spaying or neutering be-
fore releasing an animal to a new owners
Requiring only a deposit results in the per-
formance of fewer of these surgical
procedures.

Differential licensing must be enforced.
Differential licensing involves the assess- V
ment of an extremely low annual license fee
for spayed or neutered pets (perhaps 50
cents or $1) and a high annual license fee for

 

., pets that are not spayed or neutered (per-

haps $10).

Cities that have enacted ordinances in-
cluding the above have experienced a 60
percent reduction in the number of surplus
animals by the second year. These cities
have also reported a substantial decrease in
the number of animal-abuse cases — and
have brought about a significant savings to
taxpayers in animal control costs.

It is cockfighting, in which two

demned as barbaric by the Humane

E "Society of the United States and out-

E lawed in 44 states, it continues to be

‘ ardently practiced hundreds of
thousands of people, including legis-
lators law-enforcement officers and

i ' The practice of the sport, and
the money wagered on it, appears to
be growing in pOpularity, here in

and in cities from New York to Los

industry that supports three trade

“doesn’t stop it,” says Belton Hodg-,

The chief “do—good” organiza-

and by infiltrating the ranks of par-
tisans. The effort is not gentle work.

    




TAMPA TRIBUNE - June 1, 1986

 

 

Big beached beaver begs:
Ban steel animal traps

By MICHAEL DUNN
Tribune Staff Writer

Giant Beaver From Outer Space Lands on
Tampa Beach!

Sandra Mahoney saw it with her own two
eyes. The young Tampa woman was lying in
the sun Sa urday morning at Ben T. Davis
Municipal each when she felt something
poke her in the chest.

She looked up and saw a humongous 24-
foot-tall beaver hovering over her.

“I freaked out. I didn’t know what was
going on,” she said. “I thought it was a kanga-
roo!” "

“You never know what you’re going to
see at the beach,” said Ted Provard of
Tampa.

As fate would have it, the beaver was not
real. It was a 37-pound inflatable mammal
designed to capture support for federal legis-
lation curbing the use of steel-jaw animal
traps.

“Steel traps are so cruel. America is the
only country in the world that still uses them
on a large scale,” said Peter Millington, a
representative of the national Society For
Animal Protective Legislation.

Millington straps himself to his inflatable
beaver, named Betsy, and hands out litera-
ture urging support for bills that would ban
interstate commerce of steel-jaw traps and
interstate commerce of furs from animals
caught in such traps.

Several Florida legislators have co-spon-
sored the proposed legislation, including US.
Reps. Sam Gibbons, D-Tampa, and Claude
Pepper, D-Miami. _

Florida already has laws that limit the

use of steel-jaw traps, but some states do not,
he said. Millington said he and Betsy are

touring Florida to gain support for the pro- .

posed federal legislation.

“We're saying, ‘Florida, well done,’ ” he
said. “Florida is one of the few civilized
states in America. Florida had the good sense
to (regulate) those things.”

Millington’s visit to Tampa was sponsored

by the Tampa Bay area chapter of People for

the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Said local
coordinator Myriam Parham.

“The reason it’s so awful is because it’s so
indiscriminate,” Parham said of the steel-jaw
type trap. “Pets as well as endangered ani-
mals get caught in it, and they’re not even

the intended victim.”

The traps are cruel because they sever
bones and tendons and leave animals in ex-
cruciating pain for hours before the trappers
arrive, according to the Society For Animal
Protective Legislation literature.

Many animals ensnared by the trap will
chew off a leg or paw caught between the
steel jaws, and often animals unintended for
capture, such as eagles and songbirds, get
caught and injured, Millington said.

A total of 63 countries have banned the
use of the trap in favor of more modern and
humane alternatives, such as cage traps and
snares that do not injure animals, he said.

Millington said he and Betsy will travel to
Miami, Key West and Jacksonville next, then

to other cities across the nation.

legislation geared toward protecting animals

Legislation, PO. Box 3719, Georgetown Sta-
tion, Washington, DC. 20007.

The training for a racer is hard. They
are made to pull weights to build up their
leg muscles. Sometimes while trying to pull
the weights, under the whip of a trainer,
their toes and feet are badly damaged.

I am an assistant to a veterinarian, and
there are between 250 to 300 greyhounds

, brought in each year to be put to sleep.
Many others are sold for medical research,
which can be very cruel. It’s such a shame.

These are bright, sensitive, young, loving
dogs. They listen and are quick to give and
receive love.

I’m not saying stop, the races, but why
not give the dogs a little consideration?
After all, they make millions of dollars for
the tracks each year. How about a grey-
hound adoption center? ‘

People should consider adopting a grey-
hound. Any veterinarian can probably tell
someone where to get one. Some people are
afraid to adopt the dogs because of their
training, but how many times have you seen
your own dog chase a cat or squirrel?

I have two greyhounds and one chased
the neighbor’s cat, got it cornered and just

stopped and. looked at it. It did not attack the
cat.

Live Racing Lures -
- Cruel to Animals

In 1981, Florida outlawed the cruel prac-
tice of using live animals to train racing
greyhounds. This was agreed to by grey-
hound trainers, who were given three years
to phase out using live lures in favor of me-
chanical ones.

Since then. the American Greyhound
Track Owners Association unanimously
adopted a resolution “that all greyhounds be
trained on artificial lures and that. (the as-
sociation’s members support state legisla-
tures in adopting such rules;

nutrition they need to repro-
duce. Also, we have to do stud-
ies to determine just how the
grizzly habitat has been lost. In
the long term, the grizzlies and
other wildlife will not survive
unless the Park Service is re-
formed.

. USA TODAY: How?

CHASE: Park Rangers are
highly dedicated, highly ideal-
istic people who jein because
of a love of the wilderness, a
love of nature. But they must
be given the professional train-
ing they need to manage these
complex natural areas.

USA TODAY: Environmen-
talists also come in for criti-
cism in your book. Why?‘

CHASE: They, too, have an
almost religious view that hu-
mans not play God, not inter-
fere in nature. So they have dis-
couraged taking steps neces-
sary to restore the park, such
as ecocenters for the grizzlies,
tagging animals to track them,
and prescribed burning The
record of environmentalists
has not been a good one.

USA TODAY: Some envi-
ronmentalists suggest you
want to play God yourself.

CHASE: I’m not doing any-
thing other than physically en-
joying the park and trying to
describe what is happening
there. In fact, it is the other
way around. The assumption
by the Park Service and the en-
vironmentalists is we can save
Yellowstone by locking up the
wilderness and keeping people
out. By passive management,
by not playing God. I’m sug-
gesting that’s too simple.

Park ofﬁcials killing
a national treasure

USA TODAY: Why did you
choose Playing God in Yel-
lowstone as the title for your
book?

CHASE: My title is ironical.
It’s a cliche of the Park Service
that they don’t want to play
God. I’m suggesting you can’t
avoid playing God; you cannot
avoid having an effect on Wild-
life. We have to take steps to
bring back the wolves, the
mountain lions, and so on.

USA TODAY: You’re say-
ing that wildlife has not been

managed well in Yellow-
stone?

CHASE: Since the service
began maintaining it in 1916,
they have eliminated some
wildlife populations and deci-
mated others. The white deer
and the wolf are gone. The ﬁsh-
er, bobcat, wolverine, and lynx
may be gone. The big horn
sheep are in dramatic decline.

Only remnants of the beaver -

remain. The grizzlies’ situation
is desperate. The black bears
are in decline. The park is los-
ing its capacity to sustain life.

better able to know what’s go-
ing on than the Park Service?

CHASE: I don’t know better
than the Park Service. I’ve
worked on this book for over
five years and interviewed
more than 800 people. These
are not my own views on the
subject of Park Service man-
agement, but the consensus of
the scientiﬁc community.

USA TODAY: What do you
think the Park Service is do-
ing wrong?

CHASE: The Park Service
perceives its mission not to be
the preservation of resources,
but rather the attraction of visi-
tors to our park The Park Ser-
vice has become the USA’s
tourist agency, not its natural
preservation ‘agency. That’s
what’s fundamentally wrong.

USA TODAY: What is the
policy that bothers you?

CHASE: The service’s eco-
systems management policy.
The original idea was terriﬁc,
to simply allow nature to take
its course. They wanted to cre-
ate a vignette of primitive
America, to freeze it in time
the same as 200 years ago. It
was a good goal. '

USA TODAY: But?

CHASE: The service didn’t
do studies to determine the
original ecosystem. And
they’re not taking steps to re-
store it. They’re really not do-
ing anything It is essentially a
policy of no management.
Also, the park area is simply
too small to sustain wildlife as
it was in a natural state. It isn’t
a natural ecosystem. that can

be preserved.
USA TODAY: Why not?

CHASE: The Indians once
played the role of ﬁre burner.
Burning stimulates vegetation.
Until 1972, the government
had a ﬁre-suppression policy
that resulted in the decline in
vegetation that certain wildlife
depends upon. With the ab-
sence of Indians and other
predators, it became surviv
of the ﬁttest. -

USA TODAY: You say the
situation for the grizzly is des-
perate. How is that?

CHASE: The bears are being
killed faster than they can re-
produce. And the park manag-
ers are the biggest killers.
When I started in 1972, they
said there were 650 black
bears and 350 grizzlies There
were nowhere near that num-
ber, as their own scientists
were telling them. The grizzlies
were below 200. And there is
not a shred of evidence to sug-
gest 650 black bears. That num-
ber was just cooked up.

USA TODAY: The Park
Service officials disagree.
What makes them wrong and
you right?

CHASE: I’ve ﬁled a number

of requests under the Freedom '

of Information Act. I’ve devel-
oped relationships over the
years, an extensive informa-
tion-gathering system. It took
me so long to write the book be-
cause I knew the Park Service
would criticize every comma
out of place.

USA TODAY: How did the
grizzly problem develop?

 

CHASE: At one time, grizz-
lies ranged over the eastern
half of North America. They
were systematically eliminat-
ed except for some places like
Yellowstone, where they had
survived in a sanctuary. And
visitors came and left behind
garbage. But in 1968, under
their policy of ecosystems
management, the service de-
cided that garbage was unnatu-
ral and that the dumps ought to
be closed —— make the bears
eat off the land.

USA TODAY: And that hurt
the bears?

CHASE: Ever since the poll-
cy went into effect, the bears
have been in decline. Govem-
ment management has been
by trapping them, transplant-
ing them, using drugs such as
angel dust to tranquilize them,

supporting policies to make

them afraid of humans with
propane cannons and rubber
bullets. There is also evidence
that the grizzly is suffering nu-
tritionally and not getting
enough food. And the bears
have also gone out of the park
looking for food and gotten into
trouble. During the last 15
years, as many people have
been killed around Yellow-
stone as had been killed in the
area in the preceding 100
years.

USA TODAY: What can be.
done to protect people and

save the grizzly?

CHASE: The re-establish-
ment of what biologists call
ecocenters, or feeding stations,
in the center of the park. The
bears would become less dan-
gerous to people and get the

SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER- May 25,1986

Professor’ 3 pet project introduces
elderly to furry fnends

 

:By Maud S. Beelman

ASSOCIATED PRESS

. 'STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — Dan
"Lago is a matchmaker with aca-
demic credentials, looking for the
”right companions for older peOple.
” Pets are his project.

Lago, a professor of gerontology

 

., at Penn State, first became interest:

, ed in the effect pets had on older

' people while working on his doctor-
ate on loneliness. He was struck by
.‘how often during an interview an
older person would call a dog to sit
in on the conversation.

That led him to found PACT ~—
People and Animals Coming To
'gether —— a private, non-profit or-
ganization that takes a scientific ap-
proach to finding the right pets for

. people 55 and older who are living
alone.

. One thing that sets his group
apart from similar organizations is
that each recipient of a pet is as-
signed a permanent volunteer or
sponsor who helps with the care of
the pet and will take the animal
.back if things don’t work out.

“The part that is unique is their
attempt at a careful match of an
individual with a permanent pet
and then the assignment of a PACT
member to be a sponsor and a sup
port person,” says Linda Hines.
Based in Renton, Wash., Hines is
executive director of the Delta Soci-
ety. It acts as a national clearing-
house of information about pet-peo-
ple programs

Lago says pets and people don’ t
always get along.

“All you’ve got to do is look at
“the figures on animals that are

turned in to shelters every year to,

recognize that the human-animal
bond, however desirable and pow-
erful it might be, doesn’t occur au-
tomatically in every relationship
with an animal.”

But for many elderly pe0ple,
says PACT volunteer coordinator
Diane Timblin, a pet offers love and
companionship.

“For people that are house
bound, without much human con
tact, they're the difference be-
tween happiness and real unhappi-
ness,” she says.

And the animal’s playfulness

“lets you lighten up on life.” Tim-
blin says. “You forget how sore
your back is.”

, Dora-Mae Andre, a 77-year-old
i PACT member with a Pekingese
‘- named Mandy, agrees.

“She’s just like part of the fami-
ly. I’m alone, I live alone and she

really, really is an awful lot of com:

,pany.”

And taking care of Mandy helps
Andre remember to take care of
herself, she said. ' -

“Because I am busy and do a lot
of running in and out probably I
wouldn’t take a lot of time to eat. So
When I give Mandy something, I
feel I should give myself a little
something.

Andre is one of many PACT
members who shares her pet with
area nursing-home residents.
“When you get talking to them and
take your pet, they open up and say,
‘Well, I had a dog. I had a cat,’ ” she

said. “You know this is filling that .

void.” _
PACT, which now has about 40

' volunteers and about 70 current cli-

ents whose average age is in the late
.70s, has been successful in about 70

percent of its placements, "Lago
says. When matches have failed, it’s
~usually been due to the extreme

', shyness or hyperactivity of the ani-
mals, or the p00r health of the own--'
er. From experience, Lago stays’
away from puppies and dogs over’

35 pounds. .
Most of PACT’s customers come

'through referrals. The first step is

an interview with a volunteer to
determine the person’s health,
home life, financial status and atti-
tudes toward animals. That infor-
mation is turned over to an animal-
selection committee, which con-
tacts pet owners, breeders or ani-
mal shelters. All the animals are
donated.

Once a possible match is found,’
PACT arranges for a neutral meet--

'ing site where the person and ani-
mal can get acquainted.

“We find that if we bring an

animal right into someone’s home

and say, ‘Here’ s a dog, do you want
'to think about owning it?’ they tend
'not to be very discriminating,” La-

. Ago says. “They’ll say, ‘Oh great,

here’s my dog, you brought me my
dog 9 n

training. It also assists with veteri-
narian and food bills, when needed,
and sponsors help with pet-sitting
grooming or exercising, as well as
transportation to the vet. Sponsors
.sometimes are called on for grief
counseling when an owner’s pet
dies. .

, _ PACT was begun in 1981 as part
i of a research project Lago was con-
ducting With funding from a pri
:vate foundation.

Lago began compiling sample,
groups of elderly to study. One
. group took pets from PACT and
had the follow- -up services. One
group consisted of current pet ov‘vn
ers. The others were former owners
_ and peOple who had never owned
pets.
From 1982 to 1984, Lago inter-
.. éviewed about 350 participants to try
.to see whether owning a pet affect-

‘ed the person’s physical health'or
social relationships. . ..

Lago found that “simply Owning

had made a home in an aban—
doned Buick. “It was cool in there
in the summer." he said.

Adaptability a factor

Most of the coyotes of Vermont
have made dens in the woods and
”fields around the rural farms.
They range over a territory of
about 15 to 20 square miles - far
less than the coyotes of the wild.
One theory is that they are filling
a niche left empty when the
wolves disappeared, only they are
more successful because of their
adaptability and varied diet —
coyotes feed on apples and berries

and grasshoppers as well as other
animals.

One of the goals of the project is
to determine how the presence of
coyotes is affecting another pred-
ator, the fox. Person is trapping
and tracking several foxes in the
same territory.

Another goal is to provide data
for the state, which may find itself
confronted with a coyote problem
before long. In Maine, coyotes
have been so proliferous they are
considered a nuisance, particular—
ly by hunters who blame them for
a declining deer herd.

456 fee—eeyetes have not be
come an issue in Vermont, though
there have been complaints. One
Charlotte sheep farmer told Per-
son of watching helplessly as
coyotes dash out of the woods and
drag off her lambs. Person pointed
across the field, where telltale
tufts of wool ﬂuttered in the grass.

James DiStefano of the state
Fish and Game Department said
he receives about 25 reports a year
of coyotes killing domestic live-
stock. State legislators this year
approved a measure providing for
a limited control program, which
would allow state—authorized trap-
pers to kill nuisance coyotes.

But the state has no plans for
more stringent control.

Coyotes themselves are vulner-
able. Of the 26 Person trapped and
fitted with radio collars, only eight
remain. Many of the coyotes that
disappeared were young coyotes
that left the area when they came
of A age. But many have been hit by
cars or shot. The state has an
open season on hunting coyotes.
though trapping is allowed only in
the late fall.

Fear of overreaction

One of the researchers’ con-
ce ms is that people will overreact
to the presence of a new predator
in the state. Person recently got a

call from South Burlington. The
woman had heard coyotes howl-
ing at night, near the development
where she lives. She was con-
cerned for her young children.

Person told her there was no
need to worry.

“I’m excited that they're here,”
Person said. “There is a formida-

ble predator out there, not only ex- .
isting, but expanding.”

They may howl, he said, but it
is no longer the call of the wild.
Suburban coyotes respond to si-
rens and car horns with their own
eerie yip. '

“I get a thrill every time I hear

it."

. EAST CHARLOTTE. Vt. —
2‘18 spot David Person picked
it}: the trap was on a farm,
about 10 feet from an old road,
not far from the town dump.

He set it there, he explained, .
because coyotes. in one respect.
are like people: They prefer trav-
eling on roads to cutting across
rougher terrain.

He covered the trap with soil
and bits of grass. He reached
into a garbage bag and drew out
a matted, mangled and distinct-
ly pungent piece of sheepskin.
He placed it in a hole he had
dug. He produced a bottle of
dark liquid and sprinkled some
around the area. Commercially
produced coyote urine. Sells for
$17 a gallon.

The smell is what gets them;
The sheepskin is bait. The urine
is reassurance that the coast is
clear.

The trick has worked 26
times so far. In the last year and
a half, Person has trapped 26
coyotes. fitted them with collars
carrying radio transmitters, and
tracked them as they prowl the
woods and fields of the Cham-
plain Valley.

The coming of coyotes to Ver—
mont is a phenomenon. A large

 

    

.‘\

predator species moving into a
place where the indigenous
predators, the wolves and
mountain lions, died out long
ago, is rare. Coyotes are not
merely surviving here, they are
thriving.

Person, a graduate student at
the University of Vermont, is
trying to figure out why. The
$70,000 project, funded by the
university and the state Fish
and Game Department, is the
first major study done On Ver-'
mont coyotes. .

Studies have been Conducted
in" Maine, where as many as

16,000 coyotes are bencwed to
live, a far greater population
than Vermont's estimated 2,000
coyotes. Research in Maine has
been conducted in the wilder-
ness. Person is studying coyotes
with suburbanite leanings that
have established themselves , in
territory that is farmed and de-
veloped. The project covers a
450-square-mile area between
Burlington and Middlebury.
“Specifically we want tolook
at them in an area where they
are operating in close proximity
to man," said David Hirth, a
University of Vermont professor
participating in the project. “We
want to knowhow they manage
to live in such close quarters
with man and be so successful."

The coyote once was a crea-
tureoi the West. During the
19405, Scientists believe, they

. strayedfrom the plainsthrough

the upper Mid-
west to Ontario, where they trav-
eled east, crossing back into the
United States over New York and
New England. ‘

The first official report of a
coyote in Vermont was in 1942,
when one was shot near the Cana-
dian border. Since then, they have
spread throughout the state.
“They’re unbelievably success-
ful,” Hirth said. “They are a com—
mon animal all of a sudden. Thir—
ty-five, 40 years ago, there were
none.”

The key to the coyotes’ success.
Person said, is adaptability. “I like
to think of them as the streetwise
kids of the dog world,” he said, cit-
ing an example in Wayne, N.J.,
about 20 miles from New York
City, where a coyote family lives
at the town landfill. They feed
themselvesfrom a dumpster at an
A&P supermarket.

- He has found coyotes in Ver—
mont that have adapted similarly.
The radio signal of one large
coyote, nicknamed Beowulf, was
stationary for so long Person
thought he might be injured. He
traced the signal to a field in Char—
lotte, where he found the coyote




ATLANTA JOURNAL/CONSTITUTION - June 1, 1986

Floridians hatch plans to save sea _
turtles from extinction

 

By Jennie Hess
Staff Writer

MELBOURNE BEACH, Fla. —
No one knows for sure what hap-
pened to bring down the dinosaurs.
Some say the wind chill simply be-
came too brisk for Tyrannosaurus
Rex and the rest. Or maybe it was
an asteroid that finally spelled dino-
saur doom 65 million years ago.

Some ancient creatures, though,
managed to weather the prehistoric
storm to become a 20th century
cause celebre in some central Flori-
da coastal communities — the sea
turtles of Brevard County’s beaches.

They go back nearly 100 million
years. Each spring about this time,
they emerge from the Atlantic un-
der cover of darkness to lay eggs
and bury them/in the soft sand just;
below the dunes.

It’s the problem just above thr;
dunes — bright lights from condo;
miniums and beach businesses —
that threatens the sea reptiles and
has caused conservationists to rise
up in defense of the turtles.

Artificial lighting disorients
baby turtles, which travel to the sea
instinctively by the shimmering
light on the sea. If condo and street
lamps beckon along the shore, thou-
sands of hatchlings go the wrong
way and meet early death when
stranded away from the water or
run down by motorists.

The Sea Turtle Preservation So-
ciety is one of several groups in the
area working to ensure the turtles’
future by persuading beachfront
dwellers to dim their lights during
the nesting season, which lasts from
May through October.

“We’re planning on sitting down

 

and playing some hardball soon,”

says the group’s founder, local con»

servationist Peter Bandre. ,
Activists with the environmental
group Greenpeace suggested an ex-
treme approach upon hearing of the
. turtles’ dilemma several years back,
Bandre remembers with a grin.

“They said they were going to
come down and shoot some lights
out and get some people con-
cerned,” he says.

They didn’t shoot the lights out.
But folks around here became con-
cerned, and local governments have
begun their own efforts to support
the turtles’ cause.

Brevard County last year passed
a law requiring oceanfront buildings

in unincorporated areas to turn off ‘

lights along the beach at 11 pm;

A few months ago, Cape Canav-
eral and Melbourne Beach came up
with their own lighting laws, and
other beach cities now are writing
their own turtle protection plans af-
ter being urged on by the Center for
Envrronmental Education in Wash—
ington, D.C. ' '

At the state level, legislators

are considering a bill that provides
funding for beach renourishment in
eroded areas when local govern-
ments have ad0pted laws to protect

turtles from harsh lights. A state .

Audubon Society lobbyist says he is
“fairly confident” it will pass.
Loggerhead turtles also nest on
other Florida beaches and along
shores in Georgia and the Carolinas.
But more of the turtles frequent the
Brevard County shore than any-
where else in the Western Hemi-
sphere, which prompted county
planners here to go so far as to re-
quire condo owners to shade their
beachfront windows with tinted

. glass or drapes.

Senior planner Peggy Busacca
says, “What we do makes a differ-
ence to the entire population of that
endangered species.”

To some people, including India—
lantic City Councilman Gus Carey,
spending government time and mon-
ey on sea turtles is “ridiculous.”

Carey says he was “shocked”

when he first read the lighting ordi-.

nance that recently was passed in
his 1-mile-square town, p0pulation
3,000, 15 miles south of Patrick Air
Force Base on Highway AlA. He
was the only council member to
vote against it.

“I was elected to this council to
take care of the people, not the tur-
tles,” says Carey, who quickly adds
that he is an animal lover and
spends $20 a month on bird feed.

 

 

But. the lighting law designed
for turtle protection, he warns, will
be an “invitation to muggers” along
the beach and impossible to enforce.

He suggests that “zealot” con-
servationists might give direct aid
to the hatchlings without requiring
government interference if they’d
just “go down to the beach and push
the turtles into the water.”

On a moonless night along the
steep shore of Melbourne Beach, the
crashing waves can be heard more
easily than seen.

It is nearly midnight, and a fe-
male loggerhead has just dug her
nest and laid more than a hundred
white, leathery eggs that look like
pingpong balls.

Up close, by the diffused glow
of a flashlight, you can see the salty
tears the mother weeps to rinse the
sand from her eyes. Her hind flip-
pers begin to flail, and she covers
the eggs with sand before lumbering
back across her own tractorlike
trail to disappear into the waves.

Bandre, checking on the turtle’s
progress, nudges the 300-pound,
rust-colored giant along her course.

Half an hour later, Bandre is on

a stretch of beach 12 miles south,
where he and partner Wayne Stin-
nett find a clutch of eggs buried too
close to the approaching tide. They
dig up all 130 eggs, pile them into
Stinnett’s T-shirt, and plant them in
a hole closer to the dune line for
protection.

Only one in thousands of eggs
survives to turtle adulthood.

DENVER POST - May 26, 1986

Mortimer still talks at 17, but he’s slowing down

Starling has lots of company
in its southeast Denver home

By Sandra Dillard-Rosen
Denver Post Staff Writer

In bird years, Mortimer Starling just
turned 119. In people years, he’s 17.
Either way he’s pretty darned old for a
starling.

According to Mortimer’s friend
Catherine Hurlbutt, he can attribute his
long life to the fact that “starlings are
hearty, tough birds; apparently the food
agreed with him, he’s in captivity, away
from the forces of nature and accidents,
3d he’s spent a kind of monotonous

e.”

In his early days, Mortimer was a
swinger - literally - and in addition to
swinging on his perch, he would ring his
bell, and in the summer he would sing
mating songs, “like he was thinking of
wedding bells,” Hurlbutt said.

He’s slowed down a lot now, spends
most of his days sleeping on the ﬂoor of

. his cage, waking up only when he’s
hungry. He has cataracts and eats .
prescription dog food, which he can find
only by spotting the bits of yellow egg
yolk Hurlbutt sprinkles on top of it.

For his birthday Friday, he got a small

A...

cake — appropriately decorated. “I
thought I’d better do something this
year, because he might die before his
next birthday,” Hurlbutt said.

Brady Snyder, executive coordinator
of the Denver Audubon Society,
confirmed that starlings seldom live
more than 10 years in the wild, and that
he knows of only two reports of starlings
in any situation living to be 16 or older.

Hurlbutt, who is registered with the
federal and the state Division of Wildlife

agencies to house wild birds, and
whose memberships include the
Audubon Society and Denver Field

Ornithologists, adopted Mortimer

in May. 1969. “I wanted a starling
because I wanted a talking bird,
and starlings are related to my-
nahs,” she said. “A friend of mine,
Mrs. James Hildebrand, heard the
mention it when I was giving a bird
lecture to a garden club. I told
them I wanted a starling I could
call Mortimer from the Shake-
speare'line in ‘Henry IV’ where
Hotspur says, ‘I’ll have a starling
taught to say “Mortimer.” ’

“He wanted the king to ransom
his brother, Mortimer, and thought
that would bug him.”

Shortly after that, Hildebrand

called to say she had “rescued a

young starling from a cat, and he
was in a box under the kitchen ta-
ble waiting for me to come,” Hurl-

butt said.

Hurlbutt taught Mortimer to .
talk, but it wasn’t an overnight pro-
cess. “It was December before he
could say ‘Mortimer,’ ” she said.
“He woke me up Christmas morn-
ing saying that. He also can say,
‘I’ll be right back,’ in a funny little
voice, but he doesn’t talk as much
as he used to.”

Hurlbutt, a retired US. govern-
ment stenographer, lives in south-
east Denver with Mortimer, 50 oth-
er birds, some lame ducks and a
goose that she says may have an
ear infection. Pe0ple bring her hurt
or sick birds, and when they recov-
er, she takes the wild birds to an
appropriate spot, “where there are
other birds of their kind,” and
frees them.

At 73, she’s never been married.
“No man could have stood even
the first meal I cooked, plus having
a raven in the bedroom and a mag-
pie in the kitchen,” she said.

fridge where, by delicately lifting a
front paw'and pushing, he shuts the
door with a click before returning to
his place at McClanahan’s side. The
standing-room—only crowd roars, and
a series of toasts are raised to
this most miraculous of man’s best
friends. A teetotaler himself, Buck-
shot basks calmly in the limelight.
Says McClanahan, “He’s a natural-
born ham who enjoys attention.”
When McClanahan finishes his first
beer, he makes another polite request.
“Buckshot, would you please get rid of
this empty?” Buckshot picks up the
empty can, takes it to the nearest trash
can and drops it in. Everyone cheers,
but Buckshot appears unmoved.
“Buckshot’s head hasn’t gotten any

bigger,” asserts McClanahan. “Dogs
just have the ability to handle stardom
better than most people.”

Buckshot can also pick dollar bills
off the bar and place them in the open
cash register, as well as play a mean
game of pool. Reacting to three key
words (“over,” “back” and “Buck”),
Buckshot understands to jump on the
table, find any ball named and drop it
into any pocket selected. His latest
trick involves snatching a person’s hat
right off his head. At the right word
from his master, Buckshot will scan the
room for headgear and bring John any
cap he spots.

Buckshot and McClanahan have
been a team since 1981 when John’s
cousin gave him the five-week-old, half
Labrador and half Golden Retriever

puppy. Along with Buckshot’s inbred
fetching instinct comes an unnaturally
high learning capacity. “It’s amazing
how smart that dog is,” says McClana-
han proudly. “I could probably teach
him how to do most anything in just a
few minutes, and with repetition, he can
really get it down solid in about two
weeks.” Of course there are difficulties
inherent in owning such a talented dog.
McClanahan can no longer leave Buck-
shot in the back of his pickup for fear
dognappers will make off with him. But
that is only half the problem. “Whenl
leave Buckshot in the cab of my pick-
up,” says McClanahan, “I’m afraid to
leave the keys in it, as I usually do. l’m
worried that Buckshot might just take a
notion to drive off.” —Writfen by Ned
Gees/in, reported by Jane Sanderson

“Fetch” was the first word Buckshot learned
as a puppy, even before his name. He has since
graduated from sticks to suds. Above, the
canny canine demonstrates his table manners
and nose for the pocket in a friendly game of
pool with his master, John McClanahan.

While it may be premature to say
“Adios, Alex” or “Take a hike, Mike,”
Stroh’s celebrated pitchpet and the
Beverly Hills bowwow clearly have
some competition in the Cleverest Ca-
nine category. Yet unlike those hounds
of Hollywood, this fetching Fido is no
rabid card-carrying member of Actor’s
Equity. His handle is Buckshot, and
he’s a down-home hunting dog from
south of the Mason—Dixon line. What
can he do, you ask? A better question
might be, “What can’t he do?”

Come sundown on any given night in
Columbus, Miss, Buckshot can be
found on the second barstool from the
door in the taproom of the Elbow
Room bar. Most of the crowd is there
to see him, and some may havemade
the pilgrimage from as faraway as

Alaska, California or New Hampshire
to witness this local legend in action.
John McClanahan, 46, bass fishing
guide, falconer and home remodeler,
is Buckshot’s owner, trainer and top
fan. It is his wishes that are Buckshot’s
commands. As the pair sit side by side

. at the bar, a'parched McClanahan

need only say: “Buckshot, would you
please get me a beer?” and in an in-
stant, the dutiful dog is off his barstool
and racing for the back of the tavern.
There he grabs the handle of the old
Crosley refrigerator with his teeth and
pulls down, opening the door. He se-
lects an icy can of brew, returns and
places the can upright on the bar in
front of his master.

“That’s good,” praises McClana-
han, “but you forgot to close the

Society of South Coastal Georgia has adopted the two as his family.

‘Bird dog’ finds deer friends; I

Buck, Robin are his ‘babies’

By Jingle DaVis

Special to The journal-Constitution

, BRUNSWICK -— While it may
be true that early birds get their
worms, this particular early bird
got left behind when the flock mi-
grated north about a month ago.

But Robin, a fledgling born out
of season and abandoned here, is no
longer a friendless waif. The baby
bird has been adOpted by Time, a
92-pound German shepherd em-
ployed as a watchdog by the Hu-
mane Society of South Coastal Geor-
gia. ‘
Timo allows Robin to perch on

his massive head and protects the

bird from strangers.

And Robin has made another
friend. Timo also has adopted Buck,
a fawn found dehydrated and cov-
ered with ticks about a month ago
in the middle of a busy highway.

Although Buck shies away from
peeple, he loves to snuggle up to
Time and lick his big feet while
Rabin, who recently became an ac-
complished flier, flits from Time to
Buck, perching wherever he pleases.

_ Despite the fact that 4-year-otd
Timo is a male, shelter manager
Christa Weber said‘Friday the big
dog acts like a mother around Rob-
in and Buck. '

“He’s very protective of them,
especially when the three are out-
side,” Mrs. Weber said. “Inside, if a
stranger approaches, Time will tol-
erate it if I tell him it’s all right.
*But he will not let anyone approach
his babies outside.”

Timo, like Mrs. Weber. a native

of Germany, was trained as a guard
dog and as a search-and-rescue dog.
He once won a medal for saving the
life of an elderly man who wan-
dered off in midwinter and got lost.

“Timo laid on top of the man
for almost an hour until help ar-
rived,” Mrs. Weber said.

Timo, who immigrated to the
United States in January, often
gives demonstrations of his Special

' skills for law enforcement agencies,
which sometimes borrow him for

Special assignments.

Mrs. Weber, an accomplished
animal trainer who shares her fam-
ily’s apartment at the society’s shel-

ter with Time, Buck, Robin and a
baby bluejay that arrived earlier
this week, said the animals eventu-
ally will be returned to the wild.
“We have a feeder outside
where the birds can stay during the
day until they are ready to fly
away,” Mrs. Weber said. “Robin,
who talks and sings to us, will prob-
ably be here until September when

, his flock returns for the winter.” 9
Because Buck’s lack of concern ;

for his safety around Timo could
prove fatal in the wild, Mrs. Weber

‘ said she will try to find a protected

(environment, such as St. Catherines
Island off the Georgia coast, as a
home for the deer when he is old
enough to forage for himself.

“I know it will be an adjustment
for all of them,” Mrs. Weber said.
“Humans can’t seem to get along,
but here are three different species,
so peaceful and content. It’s a joy
to see them together.” .

Reviving Caribou

 

For decades, caribou ﬂourished on
Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula southwest of
Anchorage, but wildﬁres and market
hunters decimated the herds. Now state
and federal scientists are experimenting
with a technique to trap caribou and take
them back to their native habitat.

Traditionally, large animals are shot
with tranquilizer darts. But this year,
caribou are being captured under huge
nets, sedated and quickly transferred on
snowmobiles, helicopters and trucks.
The procedure, used last year in Colo-
rado, is proving much safer and less
stressful for the animals.

Says Alaska Department of Fish and
Game biologist Ted Spraker, “This will
revolutionize big-game transplants in
Alaska.”

As they did last year, the biologists
are capturing caribou from a thriving
herd that winters near Lake Louise and
transporting them about 300 miles to
Lake Emma. About two dozen were

moved last year, and about twice that.

number have been moved this spring.

Mae/hm» n/ﬂY Mncanzimz

wo. Chinese golden

monkeys, the most rare
and endangered of the
primates, are taking up
residence this summer at the
Washington Park Zoo in
Portland, Oregon.

A male and female are
coming from the Chongquin
Zoo in central China as a
result of a “friendship loan”
agreement between the
Chinese Zoological
Association and the Portland
200. Local zoo ofﬁcials hope
that if the three—month exhibit
from June through August is
successful, they will be able
to arrange a future loan with
the Chinese government for
some giant pandas.

Golden monkeys are among
the largest monkeys in the
world, with males weighing in
at 35 pounds. They have
brightly colored orange bodies
with a bluish cast to their
faces. Their strange—looking
features include a ﬂattened-
out nose that almost looks
like no nose.

The size of the male on
loan surprised Gene Leo,
director of the Portland zoo,
and other zoo ofﬁcials when
they viewed the monkeys last
fall on a visit to the Chongquin
Zoo. When the male, whose
name is Yang Yang, meaning
“sunshine” in Chinese, is ﬁrst
turned loose into his cage
from an inside holding area,
Leo says he immediately puts
on a spectacular show for
spectators. He explains:

“He comes leaping into the
cage, bounding from branch

 

to branch and banging his
body sharply against the cage
bars. It’s his way of letting
everyone know real quick
who’s the boss of that cage.”

The two monkeys in
Portland are exhibited in a
special indoor-outdoor
enclosure that allows zoo
visitors maximum viewing
opportunities.

The leaf—eating monkeys
have a high-pitched voice that
sounds almost like a baby’s
wail, and often they will stand
upright and walk like humans.
This has resulted in them
becoming the source of
legendary “wild hairy men”
stories in China. Because of
their humanlike cries and
ability to walk upright, the
monkeys often are shot at by
superstitious Chinese
farmers. The shooting of the
primates, who live in
mountainous forest areas,
often at elevations of some
6,000 feet, has become of
increasing concern to Chinese
wildlife conservationists.

The Washington Park Zoo,
at 4001 SW Canyon Road, off
Highway 26 in Portland, is
open every day from 9:30 AM
to 6:30 PM. Admission is
$2.50 for adults, $1.25 for
children and senior citizens.

Ohio zoo bOss pushes toys, wildlife

Detroit counterpart unreceptive

By ARNOLD REED

Free Press Staff Writer

' With a baby wallaby tucked under his arm,
Jack Hanna stood at the gate of the Detroit Zoo
Tuesday and spoke about caring for wildlife.

Hanna, director of the Columbus (Ohio)
Zoo; is on a 32-city tour to promote a line of
stuffed toys for Mattel Inc. He says that while
promoting the toys, he also is trying to
educate other zoo directors about increasing
the lifespan of animals.

Petting the head of the baby kangaroo, he
passed it to an assistant and gave Detroit Zoo
director Steve Graham a stuffed toy.

But Hanna’s pleasant presentation gave no
hint of the sharp differences between him and
Graham.

Graham contends the extensive travel
required for Hanna’s promotional tours en-
dangers animals’ health.

Graham would not allow Hanna to appear
inside the zoo with Walter, the nine-month-
old wallaby.

“I would never question Jack’s motives,
but. I do question his methods for trying to
educate people on animal care,” Graham said.
“I have respect for him and he’s admitted that
he is on a promotional tour for Mattel. But
today is a rainy day, and it isn’t healthy for an
animal to have done five shows and be here in
the rain. It wouldn’t be safe for a cocker
spaniel to be outhere under those conditions,”
Graham said.

When asked about the disagreement, Han-
na said: “Steve is respected in the zoo world,
but I’ve never had an animal hurt since I’ve
been on the road educating people about
:animal care. I have a $26,000 van that is fully
equipped with heaters, coolers and first aid
equipment to ensure the safety of the animals I
bring on my tours.” .

Z” on Coe, a student at Harvard’s land-
; scape architecture school, stood in the
-ele hant house and clenched his fists.
He had) come to the Franklin Park Zoo in
Boston to draw elephants for an art class. What
he saw were three grown elephants trying to
kill each other, held apart by strong chains.
”Why are the elephants fighting?," he
asked an attendant. ‘ '
”Because they’re chained up.”
”But why are they chained up?"
”Because they’re fighting." .
Coe was enraged. He knew there was a bet-
ter way, and he resolved to find it. ’
Twenty years later, Coe has become one of
the country s best architects of natural habitats,
buildin zoos designed around the laws of ani-
mal be avior, with invisible barriers and native
vegetation. In a very real sense, he has broken
those chains and set the animals free. -
In the comin years Coe plans to do the
same for the AtFanta-Fulton County Zoo (or
Zoo Atlanta), transforming an arid, urban, con-
crete-girded facility into a lush necklace of bio-
climates, from the swamps of Okefenokee to
the jungles of Cameroon. ' '

But Coe, a stocky 45-year-

says other zoos that he has,
redesigned, including those in
Pittsburgh and Seattle, were
also rescued from similar
problems. ’

."The only zoos we've
been involved with are zoos

Coe says. ”They hit bottom
and bounced back up a ain.

Coe and his partner Gary
Lee have created a $25 million,
8-year master plan to trans-
form what was rated as one of
the country's 10 worst zoos
into a Showplace.

The first step in that proc-
ess will be the creation of the
$5.7-million Gorillas of Ca-
meroon exhibit. The Yerkes
Primate Center of Emory Uni-
versity has agreed to loan 17
gorillas and about 12 orangu-
tans for this habitat, which will
become by far the largest ex-
hibit of ages in this country.

For t is project the mani-
cured, slo ing lawn in front of
the lion ouse will be trans-
formed into a West African
jun le. Pursuing this task, Coe
an Lee travel to Atlanta fre-
quently, researching horticul-
ture, examining the zoo
grounds, noting what will be
saved and what will be ex-
pended.

On a recent visit, Coe
walked through the children’s
200 with zoo director Dr.
Terry Maple and Ken Gould of

“How about a creek right

to mask t e sounds of the chil-
dren?,” Coe sug ests.

The next ay he combs
through the Atlanta Botanical
Garden, searching for native
plants that resemble African
vegetation. Coe recently trav-
eled to Africa with Maple and
others to research the land—
scape and habitats he plans to
duplicate.

”There is some kind of
magic between people and an-
imals," Coe says. ”I don’t want
to get into a religious discus-
sion onthis, but people are,
animals too . . . . For a large
r'percentaﬁ'e‘fof‘ﬁ our exlStence
we have ad to be exceedingly
aware of animals. Either we ate
them, or they ate us.”

Since natural selection fa-
vored humans sensitive to the l

 

animals around them, alll

humans still have this sensrtiv- I
ity in their genetic heritage,

Coe sa 5. Contact with ani-
mals, t en, satsifies a deep,
atavistic urge. ”i use this to ex-
glain the fact that pet food is a

illion dollar industry," he says. .

An encounter with a tame
pussycat is nothing like an en-
counter in the wild, which is

., why people hunt, hike, andgo
to zoos. What-Coe tries to "-0.
with his exhibits is reenact, as

perfectly as ossible, the expe-
rience of wi derness.

He does this by removing
the cues of civilization, elimi-
nating concrete paths, hiding
buildings behind earthen

berms or vegetation, replacing .

clipped grass with under-
growth, concealing service
roads and vehicles.

in addition, he manipulates
the feelings of the visitor by
placing the animal in a physi-
cally higher position than the

human, and by making the ex-

hibit’s barriers invisible. The
observer, wandering through
the woods, hears a roar behind
a tree, turns a corner, comes
face to face with a lioness sun-
ning on a rock. The moat be-
tween the two cannot be seen.

“We can design exhibits

that literally make the hair

stand up on the back of our
neck," he'sa s. ”it gets rig t to
your survrva sense, heightens

. your sense, you become sud-

denly more aware of your en-
vrronment and suddenly
you re alive in a way that you

2 never have been before. Of

course, we can’t assume that
the lion is going to roar on
cue.”

This style is a drastic de-
parture from the Victorian
concept of the 200 as a display
of animal oddities. Atlanta’s
sterile cages embody this
’hard” approach, in which the
animal is treated as alien and
unconnected with its environ-
ment.

By trying to duplicate the
animal's natural setting with
the ”soft” apgroach, designers
help provr e for animals’
needs they might not have
anticipated.

Bucking the conventional
approach, he combines spe-

fancy suits and academic hair—

vard peers as obsessed with
counting the angels on the
head of a pin.

COLLARED PECCARY

Michael H. Robinson’s open, broad face was creased with worry. The director of the
Smithsonian Institution’s National Zoological Park was pacing outside the Washing-
ton zoo’s auditorium where shortly, on a late-February night, Daniel H. Janzen was
scheduled to give a lecture called “How to Grow a National Park.”

Robinson wasn’t worried about drawing an audience — the place was packed — or
the arrival of the speaker. Janzen, dapper in gray suit, red tie, and polished shoes, with
his gray beard neatly trimmed, was busy checking the slide projector. Robinson was
worried about Janzen’s speech. “I just hope he doesn’t offend anyone,” he said.

As it happened, Janzen did open the hour’s talk in an unorthodox way: with a slide of
cow dung, from which sprouted a seedling of a guanacaste tree. RobinsOn had reason to
expect the unexpected, and unexpurgated, from Dan Janzen, for the 47 -year-old Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania biology professor is a man known to punctuate his prize-winning
lectures by tossing chalk dust onto his thinning gray hair or leaping atop display tables.

 

But Janzen spent the hour speaking calmly, both directly and met—
aphorically, not of the dung but of the seed it harbored. Guanacaste is
the name of Costa Rica’s national tree, a long-lived and spreading
giant. Guanacaste is also the name of the province in which Janzen has
spent many of the past 14 years working. Last, and most important to
Janzen, Guanacaste is his name for a new Costa Rican national park
that he is almost single-handedly attempting to form.

With more than 10 percent of its land taken up by national parks,
Costa Rica already has protected more than its share (and many times
the United States’ share, for that matter) of productive land from
development. Janzen and his Costa Rican assistants regularly travel to
just about every one of the country’s 23 national parks, many of them
unexplored rain forest, in an attempt to collect specimens from every
one of the country’s moth Species —— one of Janzen’s principal re-
search interests. ~

But away from the rain forest is another park that Janzen calls

home. That is a largely deforested 39-squaremﬂe piece of Pacific,

coast and pastureland known as Santa Rosa National Park. Small and
degraded as it is, Santa Rosa represents the largest patch of dry
tropical forest in the Western Hemisphere. It is a biologically rich and
unique piece of real estate, as Janzen explains and illustrates in his
talk with slides of macaws, jaguars, boas, and peccaries — some of
the spectacular species among the 3,140 caterpillars, 115 mammals,
200 reptiles and amphibians, and 171 resident birds (insects aside,
more species of each than can be found in all of North America east of
the Mississippi). And, Janzen concludes, with $10 million and a few
centuries of management (observing his principles), Santa Rosa Na-
tional Park can be expanded into a 400—square-mi1e stretch of unbro-
ken forest, which Janzen would call Guanacaste National Park. In his

Washington talk, which Janzen willrepeat throughout 1986 to people
affiliated with zoos, foundations, government organizations, and fund-
raising groups across the country, Janzen draws clearly the hard-to-
make connections between the fate of the rapidly disappearing tropi—
cal forests and our own welfare. Without foods derived from the trop-
ics, he says, “You’d be living on berries, acorns, and migratory
ducks.”

In talking about his plans, Janzen makes the illogical seem logical
— a Wilderness that can be built. From a degraded forest, he is
convinced, proper human interference can help recreate a tropical
forest in all its complexity. Impossible? Hardly, for Janzen is not a guy
to mess with idle fantasies.

,ONE SIGN OF JUST HOW IMPORTANT JANZEN CONSIDERS

the Guanacaste National Park idea was his attire that February night
in Washington. For Robinson and others who know him, the sight of
Janzen in a suit, tie, and dress shoes may have been the night’s great-
est surprise. '

Until October of 1984 Dan Janzen did not own any of these items.
In the tropics and in the large University of Pennsylvania laboratory
(crammed with boxes, papers, and bags of tropical caterpillars and
cocoons) where Janzen works and sleeps half the year, he dresses
down. Way down. In Work shirt and pants, with a rag tucked in the
back of his pants and a key chain dangling‘from his waist, he looks ‘
more like a janitor than a professor. “To look at him you’d think he’s
spent the night sleeping out on an open grate,” says ecologist and
University of Pennsylvania adjunct professor Clyde Goulden. Janzen
bought a suit and shoes and borrowed a tie in 1984 for his appearance
at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to accept the Crafoord
Prize, biology’s Nobel, for what the academy called “imaginative and
stimulating studies on coevolution, Continued on page 61

which have inspired many re.-
searchers to continued work in
this field." ,

Although Janzen’s studies
have inspired many, his abra-
sive manner and restless ener—
gy have alienated and exhaust-
ed some. His unpaid assistants,
“slaves," as he calls them, rou-
tinely quit rather than adhere
to a schedule approximating
janzen’s -— 16 to 20 hours of
work a day, seven days a week.
“Biology isn’t his career, it’s his
life," says Goulden.

Biology and park-building
are in Janzen's blood. His father
(same name) was director of the
US Fish and Wildlife Service.
Young Dan began collecting
butterﬂies as an independent
and nearly friendless child in
Minnesota, where he grew up,

principal investigators held in
Boston this past February, Jan-

in responded to a question bv i

a US government grants admin-
istrator who wondered why so
many biology grants went to re-

search overseas. “Because,"-

Janzen bristled, “we live on a
boring and thoroughly trashed

' piece of dirt.” Janzen’s appar-

ent offense at the question was
just stage drama. "I could tell

 

 

with such dedication that he
won a collecting trip to Mexico
at the age of 14. He collects
and observes ﬂora and fauna
with equal intensity and inde-
pendence today.

University of Miami bat re-
searcher Theodore Fleming
spent 10 years working along-
side janzen in Costa Rica. He
recalls, “There’d be days Dan
would go without sleeping and
eating because it wasn't conve-
nient to his research. At times
we'd pass in the forest, and
he'd be so wrapped up in his
work he wouldn't notice me.”

Chances are,
wouldn’t stop to exchange small
talk with anyone on any day. He
'characterizes himself as “ob-

knows and to many he does not, .
janzen is generous and witty. ,

He is, however, a busy, blunt,
and powerfully opinionated
man. “He likes to grab biolo-
gists by the collar -— that is,

confront their ideas in a con-
frontational manner," says ge-
nial Harvard biologist E. O. Wil-
son. “and that’s not always the
best way." Says Goulden,
“He'll sit at a colleague's semi-
nar. pinning his moths onto
boards and not seeming to pay
attention. then asking provoca-

tive questions that show he not

the guy was just playing devil’s
advocate,” he said later. Dem-
onstrating that his own com-
ments conveyed no hard feel—
ings, only lack of diplomacy,
Janzen spent much of the post—
conference evening regaling the
same official with details of the
Guanacaste plan over dinner at
a restaurant in Cambridge.
Janzen’s method has made
him as many adversaries as has
his manner. “Brilliant as he is,
some of his early work was
slapdash,” says Wilson, “and
anyone who publishes so much
is bound to arouse professional
jealousy.” Janzen has written or
edited four books, including the
daunting Natural History of
Costa Rica, an 817 -page collec-
tion of essays that attracted
174 contributors. He has pub-
lished hundreds of scientific pa-
pers in a unique, breezy style
(and has had many others re—
jected for their unorthodoxy),
posing fundamental questions
such as Why many tropical trees
he saw had such large fruits —
and answering them with ingen-
ious responses, such as that the
fruits were meant to provide
now-extinct ice-age mammals
with food to digest, thereby
transporting and readying ex-
creted seeds for germination. In

a fashion typical of Janzen —
and of biologists in the last cen-
tury, as opposed to this one ——
he came upon question and an-
swer not by complex experi-
mentation, not by reference to
the research of others, but by
detailed observation and cata-
loging of the world around him.
In the case of seed dispersal by
extinct Pleistocene megafauna,
question and answer came from
observing —— what else? -—
f horse dung. In the excrement
of a large animal extinguished
10,000 years ago in the New
World and reintroduced 450
years ago, Janzen found germi-
nating seeds from trees that
were hundreds of miles distant.

 

he megafauna theory is

but one of the many fer-

tile seeds janzen has
cast as the Johnny Appleseed of
tropical biology. Harvard evolu-
tionary theorist Stephen jay
Gould has hailed janzen as “one
of the. leading selectionists of
our present generation,” and
Wilson calls him “a heroic con-
servationist and a brilliant sci-
entist.” In scientific circles he is
best known for a 1966 study of
mutualism —— how, for instance,
a species of ants protects a spe-
cies of thorny tropical tree, the

acacia, from other insects. In return, the ants get

a rich food source from the plant for their young.

The adaptation of plant and animal to their
mutual benefit that Janzen demonstrated with
ants and acacias proved a splendid example of
coevolution, a then-nascent theory developed by
Paul Ehrlich, a biologist‘at Stanford University,
and Peter Raven, director of the Missouri Botani-
cal Garden.

Indeed, as the Swedish Academy noted, Jan-
zen’s pioneering research into the complex rela«
tionships between plants and their predators and
protectors, conducted over two decades of study
in the forests of Central America, has profoundly
influenced the course of modern biology. “Janzen
is the dean of tropical biology," Ehrlich has writ-
ten. As the curriculum developer and first in-
structor of what has come to be known as the
course in modern field biology in 1965, for a
multicollege consortium called the Organization

Janzen is the biggest of ﬁshes at Santa Rosa.
Other researchers come and go, often staying in
the comfortable hotels in the prospering nearby
town of Liberia. More regular park researchers ::
include Cornell ornithology graduate student3
Frank Joyce, who studies birds that nest in the
ant acacias, and a team of primate researchers
from the University of Alberta, led by Linda and
Larry Fedigan, who are studying Santa Rosa’s
three monkey species: spider, whitefaced, and
howler. ‘

But only Janzen has his own cabin and his own

 

for ‘Tr0pical Studies, Janzen has directly or indi— ,
rectly influenced the education of most of the
world’s leading tropical biologists. That’s because
most of the world’s leading tropical biologists
have come to the Organization for Tropical Stud-
ies’ field station in the rain forest of La Selva, in
central Costa Rica, to take the unique introdqu
tion to field study that Janzen shaped more than
two decades ago. _ '

But for the last 14 years, when biologists
have gotten to La Selva, they haven't found Jan-
zen. He generally can'be found 120 miles to the
west of La Selva, between the Pacific and the
Pan—American Highway, within mortar range of
Nicaragua. This is Santa Rosa, a hot and, for
much of the year, bone-dry “piece of dirt,” as
Janzen calls it, this time using the term with af-
fection. “Dan would rather be a big fish in a small
pond at Santa Rosa than a medium-sized fish at
La Selva,” says Fleming of the University of Mi- l
arm.

new laboratory, both rented from the Costa Ri-
can Park Service. Both are far from palatial.
(“The hOuse is dry, so it has mice,” says Janzen’s
companion of seven years, Cornell biology gradu-
ate student Winnie Hallwachs, and “the lab is
wet, so it has roaches”) The house holds much
more than mice. A small, three-room, concrete-
and-wood structure, it resembles a Wild West sa-
loon from the outside, Fibber McGee’s closet
from the inside. Clothes and plastic bags of dor- '
mant caterpillars, powdered milk, and tea hang
from the rafters, while papers, wooden moth—dis-
play cases, and a Macintosh computer compete
for places on makeshift desks. Janzen, Hallwachs, ,
and their pet paca (a squirrel-sized native rodent)
share one ofﬁce-bedroom, and “slave” Randy Ev-
ans takes the other. -

, ild horses roam the road by day,
W coyotes by night. Scorpions and poison-
- ous coral snakes, fat iguanas, and foot-

long grasshoppers sit in the dust, monkeys and
toucans in the guanacaste‘ and guazuma trees,

just outside Janzen’s door.

All in all, Santa Rosa is a spectacular spot for .

viewing wildlife, especially in the dry winter. At a
watering hole, just a mile down the road, peccar-
ies, monkeys, and other'large mammals can be
seen far more plainly than in the dense, dark rain
forests they also inhabit. If one treads carefully
over crackling leaves in- the patches of pristine
forest such as the nine-acre Bosque Hurnido, two
miles from Janzen’s camp, one can see deer, tur-
key-sized. curassow, and'agouti (a shy rabbit-sized
rodent the habits of which Hallwachs is docu-
menting in the first thorough species accounting)

 

 

below trees as high as 100 feet. Nine miles along
a road so rocky Janzen won’t risk his jeep on it is
a spectacular strand of beach. There, in the fall,
marine turtles come ashore to breed in such
numbers that, as Janzen has found, one can walk
across the beach on their backs.

And just outside its discontinuous bounds,
across the Pan—American Highway and against
the 5,000-foot slopes of two volcanoes, Santa
Rosa abuts a more striking contrast to dry forest
than any of the park’s 15 distinct habitats —-- a

cloud forest of stunted trees, draped with mosses
and dripping with moisture.

For all these natural splendors, Santa Rosa’s
principal attraction to Costa Ricans is a historic
one. A mile from Janzen’s humble abode is a
19th-century casona, a ranch manor with a color-
ful history. Here, some 150 years ago, as national
legend has it, a small band of Costa Rican soldiers
defeated the mercenary pro—slavery troops of
American marauder William Walker. In a country ‘
with no standing army and little military history,

 

‘3

such victories assume epic proportions.

“Bunk,” says Janzen. Having read Walker’s
diaries and other historic accounts, he knows the
truth —- the Costa Ricans defeated a small de-
tachment of Walker’s army, then followed his
trail north, where they were roundly. defeated.

The legacy of the casona may have been
Costa Rica’s making as a modern nation, but it

, was also Santa Rosa’s near-undoing as a wilder-H

ness. For five centuries its lands have been
farmed and ranched. Much of the unique,wood-
land was cut down to plant jamgua, an African
grass that still grows, taller than a man, each
season. So, much of Santa Rosa looks like African
savannah, not Latin American forest. As the
grass is burned away each year (the land was in
heavy ranching use until seven years after the
park was formed in 1971 and is still burned by
natural fires and man-made fires on neighboring
ranches), the intense heat kills off tree seedlings
and the forest’s natural attempts at regeneration.

 

 

Janzen has an answer to the problem — cre-
ating firebreaks and back fires that limit the
range and damage of fires. By aggressive man-
agement of fires in just a few years, Janzen al—
ready has seen forest-building results. “In five
years of fire protection of one six-acre pasture
area we have a nearly closed stand of young
trees,” he says. Halting the effects of fire allows
Janzen’s assistants to reseed the forest. These
include not only his paid workers, who plant labo-
ratory-germinated saplings, but birds, deer, pec-
caries, Loatimundis, tapirs, coyotes, cows, and
horses, which defecate and regurgitate seeds

' from fruits they have ingested in Santa Rosa for-

ests.
Back-firing and replanting are the techniques
Janzen has used at Santa Rosa and would use in

, its expanded version — the proposed Guanacaste
5 National Park. But Janzen wants a bigger park,
1 not just to begin this many-hundred-year process

of recreating a dry forest’s diversity; he wants to
link it directly to the larger mountainside rain
forest, for, as he has discovered with moths, “the
moist forest of the volcanoes is a dry-season refu-
gium for many of the dry-forest species of Santa
Rosa.” What’s true for moths is true for birds,
and likely for far-ranging mammals like the ta-
pirs, jaguars, and peccaries: They need a wet
place to go in Santa Rosa’s dry season. “These
little patches of land on the volcano slopes substi-
tute for a migration to the Atlantic coast of Costa
Rica,” a route followed by many insects and
birds, says Janzen.

censused the habitats and interviewed the

landholders before drawing up a feasibility
study for Guanacaste National Park, which he,
presented last year to the Costa Rican govern-
ment and to his American sponsors, the Nature
Conservancy, a nonprofit organization devoted to
wilderness acquisition and preservation.

He identified six principal landholders, one
small—property owner, and one association of
small-parcel settlers. He plotted a purchase price
($81 an acre), $8.8 million in all. For $3 million
more Janzen would establish a maintenance fund,
to employ a start-up staff of 50 to manage the
parkland and to provide and staff tourist facilities
and guided naturalist tours for visitors. (Santa
Rosa’s only current amenities are a gift shop at
the casona, bathrooms, and picnic tables.)

Raising $11.8 million for conservation is no

In his typically methodical manner, Janzen

- easy matter. Janzen is inclined to play down the

sum as “no more than a college biology building

or a piece of a Navy fighter plane.” But Thomas
Lovejoy, the World Wilder F und-US vice presi-
dent for science, himself a veteran of many fund-
raising campaigns, says, “This is a huge under— ,
taking. Historically, grants like that haven’t been ‘
made for conservation. Still, if anyone can do it,
Dan would be the one.” '
Janzen already has a timetable: “If Guana-
caste isn’t. bought by 1990, it’s too late. There
won’t be any forest left in Costa Rica by then,
except what’s been protected.”
‘ There is a new urgency to Janzen’s fund-rais-
ing drive. “I found an extraordinary patch of for-
est," he says, “on the northern edge of Santa

 

 




Rosa — a block of standing virgin forest, 500
acres, the largest dry forest anywhere on the Pa
cific coast.” He stopped squatters‘from clearing
the forest this spring with a promise that he
would buy the land from them when he returns to
'Santa Rosa on May 20. “I need $500,000 or the
promise of hard money by then. It’s a real scram-
ble.”

So he now devdtes 10 hours of every day. to
activities unfamiliar to a man used to working in
the field and not the boardroom. These are the

necessary steps in building Guanacaste I’ark: .;
making brochures, giving speeches, entertaining ?

journalists, and dealing with foundations and the
American and Costa Rican governments.

In the latter two groups Janzen has many
friends, for he has given much already in Costa
Rica, even if he doesn’t view it as philanthropy.
.As for electrification, he says, “I’m just being
selfish, improving my home. I needed electricity
for my equipment. Having electricity to watch
TV at night or call their girlfriends did make the
guards’ life 1,000 percent better, but happier
guards are in the interest of preserving this
land.” Janzen has also donated part of his re-
sources (which include his professorial salary and
National Science Foundation grant money) to
supplement the meager wages paid guards by the
Costa Rican Park Service, an impoverished sec-
tor of Latin America’s most prosperous nation.

cans among them, in the University of Pennsyl-

Winnie Hallwachs: “The house is dry, so it has
mice,” and “the lab is wet, so it has roaches."

“If Guanacaste isn't bought by 1990, it's too
late,” says Janzen. “There won’t be any forest
left in Costa Rica, except what’s protected.“

vania field biology course he teaches every year
at Santa Rosa. Healso employs two full-time
Costa Rican assistants, provides gratis advice on
the park system to the Costa Rican government,
and works closely with Costa Rican scientists. “A
lot of tropical biologists treat scientists in their
host countries like they are Jose Jimenezes,” says
Goulden. “Not. Dan.” Says Costa Rican Park Ser-
vice director Alvaro Ugaldi, “Dan is one of the
best biological resources we have in Costa Rica.
Few scientists, American or Costa Rican, have
done as much for this country.”

Janzen has some powerful international
friends as well. Robert Goodland, chief tropical
environmentalist for the World Bank, is another
alumnus of the Janzen Organization for Tropical
Studies course. He has taken Janzen’s Guana-
caste proposai to the World Bank, and he report-
ed in April that “preliminary indications look
good.” According to Janzen, Goodland believes
the World Bank “will cover the $3 million endow—
ment once the Costa Rican government makes a
formal application to it.” ~ '

To Janzen. making Guanacaste National Park
a reality is a matter of when, not if. But to com-

. panion and coworker Hallwachs, Janzen's dream

and its possible realization are dangerous. “I’ve
always liked our hermitlike life,” she says, “and
I’m afraid Dan will be sucked up into this world of
egos and away from our life here together. But
he assures me that when Guanacaste gets fund-
ed, he’ll put all that behind him.”

On that score, as on every other, Janzen ac—
knowledges no worry. “I may be many bad
things, but I’m not an egotist,” he says. He has
invested his life in the future of Guanacaste Na-
tional Park because he believes it is his duty. As
he writes in a forthcoming scientific article, “ . . .
if biologists want tropics in which to biologize,
they are going to have to buy it with care, ener-
gy, effort, strategy, tactics, time and cash.” Imj

Volunteers fence up
sanctuary to shelter
reptiles from cattle

By Peter Anderson
Special to The Denver Post . i

CORTEZ — Volunteers and federal
workers recently gathered on a windswept
mesa 27 miles northwest of Cortez to build a
fence — a barrier that would protect lizards
and snakes -

Bureau of Land Management workers and
25 volunteers from Fort Lewis College and
the Durango Audubon Society unloaded rock
drills, fence posts and rolls of barbed wire
from several government pickup trucks.

The plan was to fence off 433 am of
prime reptile habitat. Known as the McElmo
Research Natural Area, this parcel of BLM
land out by the Utah border harbors a wide
variety of desert fauna, including red racers,
short-horned lizards, western shiptails, king
snakes and Utah salamanders.

“The Audubon Society is often thought of
as a bird club,” said Jim Erickson, a zoology
professor at Fort Lewis College in Durango.
“Out here, we’re dealing with snakes and
lizards.”

Some species are rare

Several species found in the McElmo
Creek area, such as the leopard lizard and
the desert spiny lizard, are considered rare in
Colorado. To protect reptile habitat from
grazing cattle, BLM land managers decided
to build a fence. They bought the materials;
local volunteers interested in preserving the
area provided the labor.

“Some of these species are at the edge of
their range,” said Clair Button, a wildlife
biologist with the BLM. “For that reason,
they’re very sensitive to any impacts. Setting
aside a portion of this area for research
enables us to measure the impacts our
management policies are having.”

Tighter grazing regulations as well as
restrictions on any surface disturbances will
preserve an ecological island in the midst of
oil and natural gas country, he said. Oil and
gas reserves would still be accessible as long
as energy developers slant-drill their wells to
avoid tearing up ground within the natural
area.

50 areas designated in state .

Fifty natural areas, totaling about 65,000 .
acres, have been designated in Colorado. The
McElmo area includes a transition zone .
between salt-desert shrub and pinch-juniper
ecosystems. Reptiles living on the edge of
their range in these transition zones may be

Parasite linked
to whales’ deaths

ORLANDO, Fla.
found in the stomachs and intestines of false kill-
er whales that beached themselves off Key West
contributed to the deaths of 18 of the animals,
marine experts said Saturday.

Two of the whales thought to have the best
chance for survival arrived at Sea World of Flor-
ida in Orlando on Saturday, two days after they
and 25 others in their pod swam onto two tiny,
uninhabited islands 1% miles offshore.

All but nine of the 27 whales have died since.

Thursday. Eleven died Thursday on the islands
and seven more died Friday, five after their ar-
rival at the Sea World Marine Science and Con-
servation Center on Long Key.

All nine of the surviving whales are in ex-
tremely guarded condition, said Kim DeVos, a
Sea World spokeswoman at the marine park’s
headquarters in Orlando. Seven of the whales are
at the Long Key research center.

Of the two taken to Sea World in Orlando,
one was a 13-foot, 1,300-pound male and the oth-
er an 8-foot, 300-pound female, Ms. DeVos said.
Experts have not yet determined the sex or
weight of the other seven survivors, she said.

The mammals resemble killer whales, or or-
cas, but are more slender and reach about 18
feet in length. Killer whales grow as long as 30
feet. .

All nine sunburned, dehydrated survivors Sat-
urday were receiving antibiotics and protection
from the sun in the form of lanolin lotion and
tarpaulin shields, Ms. DeVos said.

“We have people with them constantly to

make sure they stay moist and cool,” she said,

Necropsies performed on 13 of the dead

whales Friday uncovered evidence of parasites in -

the stomach and intestines of the whales, Ms. De-
Vos said.

She said she did not know what kind of para-
sites had invaded the animals, or the extent of
the infestations, but that the parasites were “a
contributing factor” in thedeath of the whales,
along with the stress of beaching.

Parasites have been found in the past in

whales that have beached themselves.

More than 100 volunteers helped keep the
whales alive when they were first brought ashore
in Key West and also helped load the survivors
on trucks for their journey to Long Key and Or-
lando on Friday night.

The 27 whales are believed to be the same
herd that tried to beach twice earlier this week
275 miles up the Gulf Coast near Fort Myers and
Sanibel Beach. They were shoved out to sea by
volunteers both times. '

George Huebner, chief animal cruelty investiga-

from stress and abrasions. The bears also had lost a

“It's not like they were dying. It’s more a case of

The bears will be held for the next 10 days at the

LLAMAS BECAME EXTINCT IN NORTH AMERICA 10,000

bought their first llamas for their ranch in Idaho.
Kathleen had fond memories of llamas: “My
grandparents lived down by the San Diego Zoo,” she
remembers. “My father liked the gibbon, Mom
liked the hummingbirds and I liked the llamas. I
spent hours watching them.”

The Mallons were training horses when they
acquired their first two llamas, but they found them

ornaments. We realized we could make some money
training them as pack animals, to drive carts or as
companions and pets.”

Fed up with the Idaho’s cold winters, the couple
packed up their seven llamas, two horses, two dogs
and cats and came 1,700 miles to a ranch in
Southern California’s Ballena Valley. Their ZO-acre

owners is that they laugh a lot.
When you meet your first llama you’ll

says John Mallon, “but one llama has more IQ than a
herd of horses.”

When the Mallons got into llama breeding, they
found that very little was known about the animals
in this country.

“People didn’t know what llamas were,” Mallon
says. “They were just being used as pasture

North America 10,000 years ago, and only returned
when private animal collectors and zoos
reintroduced them in the late 18005.

“The first thing people ask is ‘Do they spit?’ ”
says John Mallon. “Well, you practically have to spit
at them first. We’ve never had them try to bite us.
It’s just not in them. They’re not fearful of men, but
they’ll raise hell with coyotes.”

The Mallons sell their llamas locally, many to be
used as pets by people with enough pastureland to
hold them — with an average weight of 280 to 350
pounds, mature llamas need a lot of space. Says
John, “They get along with dogs, cats, goats. We
have two that love the horses.”

A personable llama can even visit the house
occasionally. “If people have one llama, he’s in the
house with the kids watching TV all the time,” John
Mallon says, adding that the males of the breed are
naturally housebroken: “They’re clean. They have
no odor. The males make very strict piles of
droppings to mark their territory. If they wanna go,
they’ll start humming in a big way to go outside to
their pile.”

In addition to their almost human-sounding
humming, llamas also communicate through an
elaborate system of body language. “If a llama’s up
there on tap of the hill,” says Kathleen Mallon, “you
can tell what he’s saying by his body movements, by
whether the head, neck or ears are up or down. It’s
like smoke signals.” .

The alert llama sees game far and away before
you do. Says Oregon llama breeder and researcher
Susan Torrey, “They’ll stop and ‘point’ at goats, elk,
anything out of ordinary. They’re very interested in
children, too. If there’s a big gaggle of llamas in a
field, you can always go to the center and find
something: a new baby, a rabbit, a female being
bred, a nest of baby weasels. You can go out in the
field, stand on your head and in a few minutes
you’ll be surrounded by llamas.” (But perhaps this
last observation reveals as much about llama
owners as llamas themselves.)

The durable llama is undaunted by bad weather
— “except hail,” John Mallon says. “They don’t
like hail bouncing on their noses. Tony Llama just
sticks his head inside his stall and has the rest of his
body out.”

Their hardiness comes in handy for their most
practical use — as pack animals. While trucking is
fast replacing llama packing in Latin America,
recreational llama packing outfitters are expanding
throughout the western United States.

It’s easy to see how llamas have endeared
themselves to hikers. They’re good trail companions
and they carry everything. Depending on such
factors as height, weight and maturity, llamas can
tote 50- to 120pound packs 10 to 15 miles a day. Over
the steepest paths they go, leaving hikers free to
enjoy the view. Vaster, more rugged country has, in
consequence, been made more accessible.

And the llama is environmentally sound, as John
Mallon points out: “There are fifty-four commercial
outfitters where llamas are being leased to carry
surveying equipment because they don’t tear the
trail up. Their feet are padded. They don’t graze like
a horse, they browse. They’ll eat moss, twigs, bark,
whatever they can find. They’re efficient — you’ll
never know they’ve been through there. That’s why
they’re allowed in all the national and state parks.”

The llamas’ unique, specially upholstered foot
also makes them remarkably surefooted on a

variety of terrains, including sandy soils and snow.
(And if a llama steps on your foot, you won’t mind
so much as if it were a horse.)

John Lawson, a Washington surveyer, replaced
his pack horses with llamas when he discovered
how easy they were to handle. He writes in Llamas
magazine, published in Herald, California: “Several
times in the woods I’ve noticed that they’ll pick the
best trail. Whenever they see a route better than
the one you’re taking, they’ll let you know. That
shows a lot of intelligence.” '

Another major advantage is that nothing will
spook a llama, not even a chainsaw. A grouse
flushed from its hiding place can send a horse

 

 

into a five-minute frenzy; a llama will just stand
there and stare.

Since the llama has been domesticated in South
America for 6,000 years, the animals are easy to
train. “With llamas you get your strokes now,” says
John Mallon. “Horses take 90 days to learn anything.
The longest it’s taken me (with a llama who’s never
been handled) to have him follow on a loose line is
20 minutes. Their willingness to learn is incredible,
and they never forget.”

The Mallons also insist that their llamas like
to work.

“They get bored if they’re not used,” says
Kathleen. “Once when we didn’t have time to play
with Tony Llama, we just put his halter on and tied
him to a fence. It gave him something to do — just
stand there in the halter. He had a special place in
the fence. He’d go stick his neck between the rails
as if to say, ‘Come on, let’s go. I’m ready to work.’ ”

Mallon slips a halter on Tony Llama. It alerts him
that he’s on duty. They walk briskly, and the slack
in the lead never tautens. Tony Llama concentrates
on shadowing his boss, left, right, about-face. Tony
snaps his head around, shuffles his legs behind him,
and glances around to make sure you saw him. To
see a llama about-face is to love a llama.

WALL STREET TAKES NOTE

be real drama of the llama is as a business
investment. Protective treaties and quarantines
restrict llama importation from South America, so
female breeding animals in this country are almost
as valuable as gold bars. Because they have only one
baby after an almost one-year-long gestation period,
their offspring bring premium prices: A female can
be sold at six months for $6,000 to $10,000; males
start at $1,000.

The llama also makes a good investment in tax
terms, since breeding llamas car be depreciated for
five years, as opposed to only two years for horses.
Investment tax credits may also be available.

David Mohelis, a llama broker at the Pet Center
in Los Angeles, says that “everyone who’s into it
wants to breed them. A businessman may see llamas
in the Wall Street Journal: They’re nice looking. He
wants to try something different. A baby female is
worth $6,000 at birth. A calf’s worth nothing. The
horse market’s depressed or at best takes a long
time to show a profit.”

Susan Torrey agrees: “It’s so difficult to make
money with cattle, horses and sheep. We turned to
llamas because they’re a dependable, long-lived,
healthy investment. You can justify having them
because they support themselves financially.”

Maintenance costs are low. A llama eats only a
sixth of what a horse eats. They have a relatively
low protein requirement due to their efficient
digestive systems. They can be kept on a variety of

, pastures or hay. Without pasture, one bale of hay

will last an adult llama 7 to 10 days.

Llamas reach full body size by the fourth year
and, while there are no behavioral differences
between the sexes, males tend to be slightly larger.
They are long-lived, with normal lifespans of 14 to
20 years.

months, cavort with Charlotte the dog, who likes to
play hide-and-aeek with the llamas.

 

When livestock breedérs such as Torrey began
working with llamas, they found themselves
unprepared for the llama ’s differences from more
traditional farm animals. Because llamas separated
from the true ruminants (cattle, sheep, deer) early
in their evolutionary history, they have several
physiological peculiarities.

Torrey and her partner, Andy Tillman, lost a
prize female because they didn’t understand the
birthing process. “We didn’t know what type of
placenta they had and whether it should be
expelled or not.” After their experience, Torrey
started up a newsletter to bridge the information
gap. She says sadly, “We knew we needed to share
experience and promote communication among
llama breeders to prevent it happening to some-
body else.” -

Torrey keeps her five llamas on Tillman’s ranch,
now one of the largest llama ranches in Oregon. She
speaks glowingly of working with them. “They’re
not just another wild animal fad. You’re investing
in the quality of your life at the same time. They
have a somewhat catlike independence and dignity.
Llamas respond to your affection, interest and
curiosity.”

Breeder Kathleen Mallon says, “Most of our
babies range from about 20 to 25 pounds —- all legs.
When they’re newborn and wet, they look
prehistoric. They don’t look like they should be

' living. But they get out and start bouncing around

immediately. They’re always born in the daytime.
In the Andes it freezes every night, and the baby
needs time to dry out in the sun before night comes.
It makes it really nice for us.”

Female llamas conveniently ovulate after they’re
bred. They get pregnant 9“ mecca-zit of the time.

little ones. “They‘ll chase tire fees away When the

 

babies are slee ing. They show them where the
holes they mig t trip in are,” John says. “With
horses, the other mares will try and kill that baby.”

He adds, “Female llamas are most likely to spit at
a youngster to let him know he’s old enough to be
on his own.” Up until then, they’re devoted aunts.

The Mallons now have 23 llamas, with Aunt
Margaret’s baby due in July. If it’s a girl, as they
hope, they plan to name her Llama Turner or Lola
Fa-Llama.

Kathleen says, “The Spanish word for the babies
is cria. I watch them and wonder what they’re going
to be like. They all have completely different
personalities. Firecracker is so happy to be out here
she kicks up her legs in joy. Louise is very calm and

LLAMAS IN THE SHOW RING

lama breeders realized that if they could
establish standards and organize performance
classes at livestock shows and fairs they could
arouse further interest in llamas. The Mallons have
joined other breeders, like Susan Torrey and Andy
Tillman, in forming the American Llama Show
Association. Their goal is to establish uniform
standards by which all recognized shows must
abide.

At the shows, the animals compete in such
categories as packing and endurance. Handlers lead
the llamas over, around and through an obstacle
course of tunnels, bridges and trees. The llamas are
judged by their “easy way of going” as weli as their
ahiiit: ”:“7~ We» give iiazrgas the chance to become
my Ls.

1 Them-st internationally recognized llama show

 

will be held this month in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The
next local llama show will take place in Del Mar in
June and J uly, and the public is welcome.

An important goal of such activities is the health
and well-being of the llama. The Mallons feel they
have to set standards of breeding and training
before somebody does it wrong.

John Mallon, recently elected president of the
Llama Association of Southern California, speaks
passionately about the pitfalls of indiscriminate
breeding: “The Doberman for years was regarded as
the best all-around family dog you could have. It
was a 75-pound dog then. You can’t have one today.
Now they’re 115 pounds and they’re aggressive. The
brains have been bred out of them.

“Most people don’t have livestock backgrounds.
They’re not aware of the potential misuse of the
animai in the show ring. We don’t want llamas
pulling weighted sleds like draft horses. They don’t
have that kind of musculature. If they’re bred up to
700 pounds they’ll wind up with muscular and
skeletal problems.”

He concludes, “ We’re trying to protect the llama
from losing his intelligence and disposition — his
graceful way of going. We want to see form for
function, rapport between handler and llama.
They’ve been domesticated longer than anything
but the dog and have an innate willingness to
please. It would be tragic to see that go away.”

In the stressed-out ’80s, maybe we could all use
the company of a llama, Kathleen Mallon suggests.
‘They seem above it all. They’ve been around for so
many hundreds of thousands of years they’ve seen

Elephant kills another
with shove into zoo moat

LOS ANGELES (AP) — An elephant
with a reputation for orneriness shoved
a more docile elephant to its death at
the Los Angeles Zoo, officials say.

Tara shoved McClain, another fe-
male, into an empty concrete moat.
The 10-foot fall broke the animal’s
neck.

“What the keepers told me is that
McClain was standing near the edge,
and Tara just butted her,” said Lora
LaMarca, a zoo spokeswoman.

LaMarca rejected Speculation that
the incident was the result of a “love
triangle” involving the two females
and Hannibal, their consort.

derness of Glendale .

past the jungle thickets of
Long Beach . . . the safari
is making its way. A zoo-to-
you program by the Great-
er Los Angeles Zoo Assn.
(GLAZA) will take the
less-than-fleet-of-foot resi-
dents of Southland senior
citizen centers and retire-
ment homes on a free wild-
life tour, with an armchair
visit to the Los Angeles
Zoo. Naturally, one show-
stopper in the 45-minute
slide show and discussion
is the 200’s huge Galapa-
gos tortoise, which can live

up to 180 years. “Wouldn’t
you love to know what kind
of vitamins he takes?” que—
ries the tour guide, to
inevitable oohs and aahs.
Another crowd-pleaser is
the rare Ukari ape, since
everyone has a relative
just like him—he’s com-
pletely bald and perma-
nently red-faced. There are
a lot of baby animals in the
show, too, and the stupefy-

stays pregnant for 22
months before delivery.

Nocturnal keeper is a star at zoo’s late late ShOW

By LISA POPE
Staff writer

Tom Swift’s work is comforting the ill,
warming milk for infants and feeding
the hungry. Yet he rarely sees another
human being on the job.

“The assumption is that when the peo-
ple go home, the animals do too. But it’s
really a 24-hour operation,” said Swift,
who works at the Dallas Zoo.

In a city where most nighttime work-
ers can be found at convenience stores,

 

24-hour restaurants or behind the wheel
of a police cruiser, Swift has one of the
more unusual after-de jobs in Dallas.
Swift works the night shift, swinging
into gear long after the last Visitor has
gone. From midnight to morning, he
cares for the 200’s 2,000 assorted crea-
tures — antelopes to lizards, monkeys to
giraffes. -

It’s a beloved mission. “I was so in-
credibly fortunate, considering my fasci-
nation with the study‘of animals, to be
able to do this,” said Swift, 34. “I’m kind

of a nocturnal animal anyway.”

The job also allows the native Texan
to pursue his second love —- the stage.
After earning a theater degree at South-
ern Methodist University, Swift joined
the national actors’ union and performs
regularly in area plays and makes
commercials.

It’s rumored that Swift practices his
lines in front of the monkey cage — but
Swift said his acting can’t upstage the
animals.

LNIMAL — From Page 11A

Among the best actors at the zoo
ire baby orangutans Doc and Dix-
e, who perform at midnight. Their
sleepy eyes light tip with anticipa-
tion when Swift pulls their bottles
of Simulac from the refrigerator.

Dixie feeds herself, but Swift has
to hand feed her younger brother.
After they’ve sucked the bottles
dry, Swift burps them and mo-
ments later they’re fast asleep in
each others’ arms.

But Swift said the most exciting
scene at the zoo is a birth. “They’re
a real kick. It’s almost a competi-
tion among us to see who can ﬁnd
(newborns) ﬁrst,” Swift said.

Last month, when a giraffe
plopped into the world, Swift said,
“We just watched. You don’t help a
6-foot, 150-pound baby get born.

They drop 5 feet all by_

themselves.”

Theater at the 200 is always im-
promptu. “When it’s real cold -or
stormy out, we really have to be on
the ball. Lots of animals, for some
odd reason, like to have their ba-
bies in storms,” he said.

Swift’s nightly rounds of the 554
acre zoo begin at the commissary,
where night supervisor C.J. Cato, a
longtime zoo veteran, alerts him to
animals in need of close attention
—— overdue mothers, newborns or
hospitalized animals.

His meeting with Cato often is
the last time Swift talks to another

human all night. But from the li-,

on’s cage to the monkey house,
there’s no shortage of company.
“We’ve had many a conversa-
tion,” he said of his favorite felines,
the Siberian tigers, who often stroll
to the edge of the cage to visit.
Swift, who teaches a summer
class on nocturnal animals, said

. nights offer other rare insights into

the zoo. Inside an atrium at the
reptile and birdhouse, for instance,
Swift’s flashlight often catches the
reclusive nocturnal echidna, or ant—
eater, doing ﬁgure-eights in search
of insects.

“He’s the only one in captivity in
the Western hemisphere, but it

seems like (the six night-keepers) ,

are the only ones that ever get to
see him,” he said.

Swift, who joined the 200 staff
four years ago, said it didn’t take
long to befriend his charges. Al—

though he tries not to play favor-

ites, Swift has one -— Kanda, a 3—
year-old lowland gorilla.

Swift recalls his birth, 10 min-
utes after he left wOrk one morn-
ing. “I heard it on the (two-way)
radio and ran back in. I was the
third person to see him. His moth-

. Tom Swift watches over the lemur cages at night: “I’m kind of a nocturnal animal anyway.”

er died the day he was born,” said
Swift, one of Kanda’s many proud

, foster parents.

Kanda will be missed soon when
he moves to another zoo to learn
what his human parents can’t
teach him — the ropes of gorilla
life. He’ll return in about six years.

J

  

when he’s sexually active, Swift ‘
said, “hopefully to be the alpha
male of the Dallas Zoo —— the lead-.
er 0f the troop.

“Kanda’s definitely my favorite
creature —- he’s so much beyond
animal, it’s hard for me to think of 9
him as (one).”

DETROIT FREE PRESS - April 21, 1986

New look in store for *letroit

By DOLLY KATZ

Free Press Staff Writer
Picture this:
0 A new Detroit Zoo main entrance on Woodward

Avenue, its brick entryway framing the 200’s quaint
1926 birdhouse.

0 A new grassy picnic area with a panoramic view of
the zoo.

0 Lion and tiger houses that give visitors nose-to-nose
views of the big cats.

That is what the 200 will look like when some $15
million worth of construction and renovation projects
under way are completed in May 1987.

“All of this activity represents our commitment to
return the Detroit Zoo to its former glory,” zoo director
Steve Graham said Sunday, describing details of the
plans. Last year, the zoo received its first accreditation in
its 60-year history from the American Association of
Zoological Parks and Aquariums.

The $12 million main entrance, about 200 yards from
the present entrance on 10 Mile Road, is being built with

federal and state highway money as part of the construc-
tion of the last leg of Interstate-696. An exit from 1-696
will lead to the zoo.

The entrance area will include a three-story, 660-car
parking garage, rest rooms, souvenir and refreshment
stands and a 30-foot-high landscaped mound to block
freeway noise. An eight-foot-high brick wall with a
rounded top will extend around half the zoo.

The new picnic area, which will be completed in
about three weeks, is on the site of the old great ape
house and amphitheater. In two or three years, depend-
ing how fast the zoo can raise the money, a $6 million
chimpanzee exhibit will be built on the spot, Graham
said.

The renovations include new roofs for the elephant,
lion, and tiger houses. ‘

The lion and tiger houses had deteriorated so badly
that they were closed to the public about four years ago.
Old-fashioned cages are to be replaced with large,
natural-looking glass-fronted areas. Heating pads placed
strategically under the sandy floors will encourage the
lions and tigers to lie right next to the glass.

“You’ll have nose-to-nose exposure,” said Graham.

When Sue Strong
became paralyzed from

her independence and
many of life’s everyday
freedoms seemed lost to
her forever. Who would
have guessed that a furry
six-pound bundle of
energy could help her
win them back?

t should have been the start
of a wonderful adventure,
perhaps the start of a whole
new life. Sue Strong, twenty-
two years old, was headed
to California with her boy-

friend of ﬁve years and a mutual

friend. The three had rented a van
for their cross-country drive and
had gotten an early start out of

New York one morning in Sep-

tember 1971. Sue, who had recent-

ly received her master’s degree in

library science, was enjoying a

ﬁve-week vacation from her job at

the New York Public Library. Her
boyfriend was moving to Califor-
nia; she was going along to help
him settle in and to investigate
job opportunities for herself with
the idea that she would join him
later. An art lover (continued)

(continued) with a sharp mind,
quick wit and lots of ambition,
Sue was excited about seeing the
West Coast and about all the pos-
sibilities awaiting her.

The three friends had gotten
only as far as Pennsylvania, how-
ever, when suddenly the van’s
steering mechanism snapped. Sue,
who was asleep, never knew that
the van veered off the turnpike
and ﬂipped over. All she knew was
that when she came to, she was
groggily agreeing to a tracheot-
omy in a hospital emergency room
and telling doctors to be gentle in
breaking the news of the accident
to her parents.

Her boyfriend and the other
young man walked away from the
wreck with only superﬁcial cuts,
but Sue was not so lucky. Her
fourth and ﬁfth vertebrae had
been twisted, squeezing her spi-
nal cord in such a way that she
was permanently paralyzed from
the shoulders down. Not only did
her dreams of a career, marriage
and children have to be aban-
doned but Sue soon discovered
she had become a prisoner in her
own body. From that moment on,
even a task as simple as pouring
a glass of water was beyond her
capabilities. (continued)

1‘

It’s lunchtime in Sue Strong’s apart-
ment, and Henrietta is busy fussing
over her employer’s sandwich and juice.
She serves it to Sue in her favorite spot,
in front of a window overlooking busy
Manhattan streets twelve stories be-
low. When lunch is over, Henrietta pops
a music cassette into the tape recorder,
brings Sue a maga-
zine and turns up
the lights so she can
read more comforta-
bly. Before leaving
Sue to relax, she care-
fully combs her boss’s
short brown hair, be-
cause Sue is expect-
ing company later.

Henrietta—or
Henry, as Sue affec-
tionately calls her—

is not a live-in nurse.
Henry, in fact, has a
hankering for ba-
nanas, a tendency to
hang upside down by
her long, furry tail,
and a very expres-
sive, tennis—ball-
sized face. That’s be-
cause Henry is a lithe
and lively six—pound
capuchin monkey
(the kind organ
grinders work with),
and she has been spe-
cially trained to be
Sue’s helpmate for
life, much the same

way a Seeing Eye dog

is trained to be an

aide to the blind.

“I suppose you

could - say we have

a love relationship,”

says thirty-seven-

year-old Sue. “Henry

is one third working

animal, one third

friend, one third child.

She is responsible for

making this apart-

ment my home, not

just a place to live.”

As a graduate of a

unique experimental

program—the Capuchin Monkey Proj-

ect, headed by Mary Joan Willard,

Ed.D., at Albert Einstein College of

Medicine, in the Bronx, New York-—

Henry has been able to give Sue back

some of the independence she enjoyed

before her accident. Sue, like more than

a hundred thousand other quadriple-

gics across the country, is unable to

turn on a light by herself or do most

things that able-bodied people take for
granted. Before Henry came to live with
her, Sue’s afternoons had to be mapped
out in the early morning before one of
her part-time aides left for the day—
lights turned on or off, stereo playing or
left silent, an unwrapped sandwich
propped up on her special food dispen-

 

 

ser, poised for biting. It was a life bereft
of options or spontaneity.

“But now, with Henry here,” says
Sue, watching the monkey carefully
groom herself, “I can eat what I want
when I want to, I can drink what I want
as often as I want, I can switch books, I
can turn lights on or off.”

Small achievements for most of us,
perhaps, but not for a quadriplegic; re-

gaining some autonomy can buy an
invaluable amount of dignity. What’s
more, having Henry along on outings
(an aide accompanies Sue, and Henry,
leashed, perches on the aide’s shoul-
ders) has ended some of the isolation
Sue used to endure. “When I was ﬁrst
in a wheelchair,” Sue says, “people were
always staring or
looking away. With
Henry, I have amus-
ing and pleasant en-
counters instead. Peo-
ple tend to forget
about my situationbe—
cause they’re so over-
whelmed with curi-
osity about Henry.”
The lack of this sim-
ple human commu-
nication so tortured
two wheelchair-
bound friends of Sue’s
-—neither of whom
had helper monkeys
like Henry—that they
were drivento suicide.
, (One starved himself;
the other enlisted the
help of an able-bod-
ied sympathizer.)
One would think
that itwas an animal
lover and someone
long attuned to the
needs of the handi-
capped who envi-
sioned the monkey
project. But Willard
was neither when the
idea for her pioneer-
ing project ﬁrst came
to her, back in 1977.
Now a psychologist
and assistant profes-
sor of rehabilitative
medicine at Albert
Einstein, she had
been working part-
time for the noted be-
havioral psychologist
B. F. Skinner in Bos-
ton when she be-
friended a young
quadriplegic. Moved

by his situation and _

aware of his boredom, Viﬁllard worked out
a plan to train monkeys to be the hands
and feet of the severely disabled.

The project was slow in getting

- off the ground. Willard, who had never

done any animal training, not only had
difﬁculty ﬁnding appropriate monkeys
but also had trouble getting funding for
her research. 'IVvo years and thirty-
eight rejections later, she ﬁnally re-

 

ceived a grant and placed her ﬁrst mon-
key, Hellion, with Robert Foster, a twen-
ty-ﬁve-year-old quadriplegic in Water-
town, Massachusetts, in 1979. (The
monkey project is currently funded by
the Veterans Administration and Na-
tional Medical Enterprises.)
deay Willard gets so many hun-
dreds of requests
from quadriplegics
who would like a
monkey that she
can barely keep up
with the paperwork.
But since there are
still so few mon-
keys ready to be
placed, Willard usu-
ally has to reply with
a form letter saying
she can’t help at this
point. She hopes that
within two years,
she can begin to
place more mon- 1
keys throughout the !
country. l
Sue was one of the
lucky ones who was
recommended to Wil-
lard shortly after the
Capuchin Monkey
Project moved to Al-
bert Einstein. In late
1982, after several
years of living on her
own in her apart-
ment, Sue was con-
tacted by one of Wil-
lard’s trainers. “Aside
from turtles I’d had
as a child, which I
don’t think count, I
had never owned an
animal,” Sue says.
“But I wouldn’t call
Henry owned. Shehas
quite a strong per-
sonality. We cohabit.”
Winning the trust
of Henry and her
trainers was no sim-
ple matter, however.
“Willard sent one of
her people down to
interview me,” Sue
recalls. “It was like being accepted as an ;
adoptive parent. They wanted to be sure
it was a decent home, that there weren’t
any priceless furnishings, because you’d
never keep your antique vases all in one 5
piece with a monkey around.” '
Sue ﬁt all of Willard’s requirements,
perhaps the most important being that
aside from trips to the supermarket
and occasional excursions to art mu-

seums or Broadway shows, Sue spends
a good deal of her time in her four-room
apartment. She is conﬁned to a motor-
ized wheelchair, and her legs, wasted
and slight under slacks, are stretched
out in front of her on the Chair’s leg
rest. Sue can move only her head and
her right forearm just enough to con-

 




trol the lever that drives the chair
across the polished wood ﬂoors. She has
a shoulder-high worktable on wheels,
on which she keeps a typewriter (she
types by punching the keys with a stick
she holds in her mouth), a rack of cas-
sette tapes, magazines, and special trays
that enable Henry to prop up sandwiches
and juice for Sue to eat and drink.

Sue has been trapped inside her body

this way for nearly ﬁfteen years. During
the ﬁrst few weeks after her accident,
“doctors kept telling my family I would
die,” Sue recalls. She battled near-fatal
pneumonia and bedsores so severe her
bones protruded through her skin. She
was eating so little that her weight
dropped below one hundred pounds. The
cause was more psy-
chological than phys-
ical, however. “At the
time,” Sue says, “I
felt it would have
been better not to
have survived.”

For six years, Sue
lived at Goldwater
Memorial Hospital,
in New York City, a
facility for those re-
quiring long-term
care. Her days were
mainly spent ﬁght-
ing depression. “By
the time I was well
enough to be bored,”
Sue says, “I started to
realize how much I
couldn’t do. I told my
boyfriend he should
go on ahead to Cali-
fornia and ﬁnd an-
other girlfriend.”

In 1977, after
money from a suit
against the van com-
pany came through,
Sue left Goldwater
on a weekend pass
and never went back.
Her older sister had
secured her an apart-
ment in a wheelchair-
accessible building
and helped her move
in. The money en-
abled Sue to employ
parttime aides, who
are responsible for
lifting her out of bed
and into her wheel-
chair in the morn-
ing, bathing her,
dressing her, cook-
ing for her and exer-
cising the mus-

cles in her nonfunctional limbs, “so that I
don’t curl up into a little ball,” Sue says
good-naturedly. One of the aides must
also stay with Sue overnight to keep
watch on the respirator that she
needs to help her breathe at night.

Still, even with aides around to
tackle the big chores, Sue used to face
the daytime hours alone, unable to do
anything for herself. Before (continued)

Henry came, this was a very lonely ’

stretch of time. But for the three and a
half years that Henry has been livmg
with Sue, all that has changed. When
not helping Sue with some task, Henry
will amuse them both by trying to peek
into neighbors’ windows, throwmg
kisses at herself in the mirror, trying to
steal Sue’s mail or
drawing pictures on
a pad. (“They’re not
good enough to put
up on the refrigera-
tor,” Sue says, smil-

 

 

“‘

to live with Sue, the monkey would
race around ﬂipping lights on and off
and retrieving small objects—without
instructions from Sue. Much to Wil-
lard’s distress, Sue continued to reward
Henry “because,” says Willard, “Sue
just couldn’t hurt Henry’s feelings. It
took a while to break Henry of this.”

But she still hasn’t been completely
broken: When Henry sees Sue reading,
she dims the lights, knowing that Sue

“A lot of comedy would go out of the
house without Henry,” Sue says. Among
Henry’s favorite pastimes are car rides
with Sue (an aide does the driving and

ing.) And at the end
of the day, when Sue
goes to sleep in her
bedroom, she needs
only to say, “Cage,

attendants). She also enjoys rough-
housing with aides or visitors—playing
tag, tickling vulnerable ankles, unlac-
ing sneakers, indulging in pillow ﬁghts
and raiding pocketbooks in search of
sweet-smelling items.

The relationship is clearly happy and
lively. but at its core, it’s a practical one.

by the window, slam—

that locks her in for

Henry’s breed—
the capuchin—was

chosen by Willard

for its intelligence,

small size and rela-

tively low-key tem-

perament. Like most

capuchins, Henry is

loving and ﬁercely

loyal to members of

her troupe, which

includes Sue, Sue’s

family and the part-

time aides. But mon-

keys are often sus-

picious of and some-

times even hostile to-

ward strangers. In

fact, until Henry knew

Sue well enough, Sue

was advised not to

smile at her, be-

cause to monkeys,

bared teeth are a

sign of aggression.

Trained capuchins,

however, are proba-

bly less destructiVe

thanthe averagechild,

although Henry has

broken a bowl and drawn on Sue’s walls
with pencils. “And like mothers with
eyes in the back of their head,” Sue
says, “if it gets too quiet, I say, ‘Henry,

stop whatever you’re doing.’ ” In fact, '

the price Willard had to pay for work-
ing with such intelligent animals is
that they are clever enough to be truly
mischievous.

For example, when Henry ﬁrst came

 

To turn a capuchin
monkey into an indis-
pensable helper, Wil-
lard’s project brought
together behavioral
science and advanced
technology. The re-
sult is that Sue’s
wheelchair has been
rigged with a device
that enables Sue—
by using her chin—
to point a red laser
dot at any object in
the room. Henry
learned, after six
months of patient
training by Willard
and her staﬂ’, to re-
spond by performing
the appropriate task,
such as opening or
closing a door, or tak-

_ ing a plastic contain-

er of soda from the
refrigerator and plac-
ing a straw in it. (Hel-
lion, Robert Foster’s
monkey, even oper-
ates a Dustbuster and
a toaster oven.) Each
time a task is per-
formed successfully,
Henry is rewarded
with a sip of straw-
berry juice that Sue
releases by blowing
intoatubeleadingto
a container at her
side. And if Sue is
slow in giving Hen-
ry her reward, the
monkey impatiently
pushes the straw in
front of Sue’s lips.

let go of the memory of yourself the way
you used to be, because you’re never
going to be that way again. You begin
to focus on positive things you still
have—the fact that I can talk, see,
think. And I’m not unique. There are
thousands who have been through what I
have and worse.” .
While we’re talk-
ing, Sue is constantly
aware of Henry’s
whereabouts. If she
wanders too far out of
sight, Sue calls her
back. And when the
conversation returns
to the subject of the
monkey, Sue is decid-
edly more relaxed and
animated. “Animals
in general raise mor-
ale,” Sue says. “Peo—
ple relate more open-
ly to animals, be—
cause it’s not a judg-
mental relationship.
They feel freer to ex-
press themselves.”
Using Sue as a ba-
rometer, the program
appears to be a huge
success—so much so
that Sue says she
would not replace
Henry, even with a '
robot that would out-
strip her usefulness.
“I’d think about in-
cluding it,” she says,
“but I wouldn’t get
rid of Henry. I don’t
like machines,” she
adds ﬁrmly. “When
you suffer an injury
like mine, you end
up being saddled
with machines for-
ever, and they all
break down.” Henry,
on the other hand, is
“usually thoroughly
reliable,” Sue says.
What is perhaps
more important is
that Henry has be-

 

come an integral part of Sue’s household,
if not a major unifying force. Sue jokingly
complains that these days, when her fa-
ther comes to visit, it’s really Henry he
comes to see. And later, when Sue’s older
sister comes by to pick Sue up for dinner,
she breezes past Sue and goes directly to
Henry, who is happily cooing and click-

 

ing at her arrival. “It’s just like when
relatives come to visit,” Sue’s sister says,
laughing. “They go right past the mother
to say hello to the kids ﬁrst.”

Sue doesn’t like to think about life with-
out Henry. But should she outlive Henry,
who, at seventeen, is now middle-aged for
a capuchin, Sue says she would replace

her. And while Sue
doesn’t have to worry
about parting from
Henry yet, she does
vividly recall their
ﬁrst short separa-
tion, when Sue took a
two-week summer va-
cation. Henry stayed
at the lab with VVil-
1ard, who says that
Henry paced, lost
weight and tore at
her fur. “When I got
back,” Sue says, “we
had a reunion to rival
anything in the mov-
ies. Henry just went
out of her mind with
joy. She was hugging
my head and chatter-
ing away for about
three hours. Every-
one said she was
; talking about how
E horrible it was when
I was away.”
’; Normally, though,
‘ Henry shows her af-
fection in a quiet-
er fashion. “She’ll
sit on my lap,” Sue
says, “and groom my
arms and my toes in
a very friendly way.”
When Henry is this
near, Sue can move
her right arm over
just enough to rest it
on the monkey’s little
. body. “Henry views
affection the way
a psychologically
healthy person
would,” Sue explains.
“That is, when you
give it, you usually
get it back.” End

Drastic cuts expected in islands’

traditional pilot- whale slaughter . A .

The Guardian

LONDON -— The government of
the Faeroe Islands is expected to
respond to widespread internation-
al protests at the barbarity of the
islands‘ traditional pilot-whale kills
by ordering drastic cuts in the
scale of the ritual.

An internal report prepared for
the government by its director of
fishing, K jartan Hoydal, and due to
be published this week, will recom-
mend the closure of seven of the
islands’ whaling bays, where the
whales are driven to be
slaughtered with lances, clubs and
knives. ,

If the islands’ parliament, the

Lagting, accepts the report... envi- _

ronmental groups expect the num-
ber of killings, which numbered
2,580 last year, to drop by .up to a
. half.

Growing embarrassment

The killings, which are concen-
trated in the summer months, have
been a source of growing embar-
rassment to Denmark, which con-
trols the islands’ defense and for-
eign policy, as well as the self-
governing local administration of
the Faeroes, which lie about 200
miles off the north coast of Scot-
land. .
International outrage was
stirred by television pictures of the
ritual shown in the United States
and Britain last year. The
Faeroese government’s fear of
other nations imposing a boycott
on the islands’ fish exports, which
account for 98 percent of their total
foreign trade, appears to have

overriden the islanders’ fear that a
reduction in the killings will de-
stroy a cultural tradition dating
back 400 years. '

Using fishing trawlers and small
boats, the islanders drive the
whales, up to 400 at a time, into
shallow bays where they are
beached and slaughtered. A report
last summer by the Environmental
Investigation Agency described the
hunt as a “cruel indulgence” that
could no longer be justified on eco-
nomic grounds when the islanders
enjoyed one of the highest stand-
ards of living in Europe.

Many left injured

The EIA report said, “No matter
how wellbrganized and efficient
the kill, it is impossible not to in-
flict considerable pain on the
whales. Large kills can take over
four hours to complete, and the
whales have to swim in the blood
of others before being killed them-
selves. The whales can be seen to
thrash and struggle in pain. Many

whales are left injured for as long -

as a few hours before being
killed.“

The report went on to describe
how children were given the day
off from school to join in the kills,
playing in the bloodied water,
among the dead whales, and help-
ing to cut fetuses out of pregnant
whales.

The Faeroese government’s own

' report, if its recommendations are

implemented, will come some way
to meeting the ElA’s demand for a
restriction of 880 whale killings
each year. It will also serve to

head-off criticism at the Interna-
tioonal Whaling Commission when
it meets to consider its own report

By The Associated Press ,

MISSOU LA, Mont. — With 50 tro-
phy bull elk in the Boone and
Crockett record book, Montana is
still the nation’s premier elk-hunt-
ing state -- but not for long, says
. Arizona Indian biologist Joe J ojola.

Within five years, he expects
fourth-place Arizona to take over
the lead, propelled by the phe-
nomenal success of a trophy elk
management program that has
produced a herd of from 5,000 to
6,000 elk on the 1.6-million-acre
White River Apache Reservation.

Jojola, an Apache, told the Na-
tive American Fish and Wildlife
Society meeting in Missoula last
week that the trophy bulls are
bringing a quarter million dollars a
year to his reservation from a se-
lect handful of hunters.

A tribal trophy hunting program
offers 32 to 37 permits a year for
seven—day autumn hunts that in-
clude lodging, guide service and
game handling, all for $7,000.

The price will jump to $8,000 this

year, he said, and there’s a waiting
list of 200 people.

“There’s some people out there
with big bucks. They’re willing to
dish out some money for a quality
hunt,” he said, touting the potential
economic advantages of quality
recreation programs in Indian
country. ' ‘

. “These programs have the po-
tential for bringing a lot of money
in,” he said

Though some criticize such pro-
grams because they cater to the
elite, he said it’s tough to ignore
them when government support
fer wildlife programs is on the bud-
getary chopping block.

The Apache - reservation also
provides free late-season elk per-
mits to tribal members, whose in-
terest in elk-hunting is on 'the in-
crease, he said. About 1,800 tribal
members took out permits last
year, compared to 700 in 1980.

“Most states are into quantity”
in elk production, he said, “but the
quality just isn’t there.”

 

[__,

SOme states, including Montana,
are starting to re-emphasize quali-
ty elk-hunting, he said, but “most
states consider quality anything
with a branched antler.”

Biologists and technicians from
the Flathead Indian Reservation
told a similar recreational success
story at the conference, reporting
that the seven-year-old tribal rec-
reation program. took in nearly
$100,000 in permit sales last year
and finished $27,000 in the black.

THE HOUSTON POST - April 21, 1986

Education programs for kids can

help stop anima
abus<

Children should be taught
to have respect for all
of nature's living Creatures

Dear Dr. Shannon: It seems we hear and read
more and more about animal cruelty and abuse. I
cannot understand how people can do these things to
animals. These are animals that only want to give
nothing but love.

Everytime I read about animal cruelty, it makes
my blood boil. Don’t people realize that an animal ex-
periences pain, stress, anxiety and disease similar to
the way a person does? We need to help the abused
animals — they cannot help themselves.

What’s being done in the Houston area to deal with
this problem? What do you think should be done to
control animal abuse?

Dear Reader: Yes, you are currently hearing and
reading more about animal abuse because more ac-
tion is being taken to address this disease of society
than in the past.

Animal abuse and suffering has been a major con-
cern of animal welfare agencies for decades but, un-
fortunately, public apathy often kept the subject out
of mind and out of sight. Thanks to the news media,
more people are aware of animal problems and more
concern is being expressed.

In my opinion, there are two primary methods to
combat animal abuse problems. First, the law must
be enforced. This is easier said than done as most law
enforcement officials are overworked dealing with
crimes involving people.

 

Consequently, the crimes people inflict on animals
are often relegated to a low priority status. The pub-
lic should realize that the investigation of animal cru-
elties is not a responsibility of the local city and coun-
ty animal control agencies. Their concern is
primarily animal control.

Animal cruelty programs in the greater Houston
area are the responsibility of animal welfare organi-
zations, which are dependent upon public contribu-
tions for existence.

Considerable progress has been made in recent
years because of the dedicated efforts of four Houston
area animal welfare organizations: Animal Rescue
League, Citizens for Animal Protection (CAP), Hous-
ton Humane Society and the Houston Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (HSPCA). The Ani-
mal Rescue League, CAP, and the Houston Humane
Society are separate agencies; however, for cruelty
investigations they function as one unit identified as
the Associated Humane Societies (497-5656).

Under George Huebner’s leadership, this organiza-
tion investigates hundreds of cruelty complaints each

year. The Houston SPCA’s Humane Education / Inves-
tigation Division (869-8229), under the leadership of
Patricia Mercer, also provides an animal cruelty in-
vestigation and education program. Therefore, you
easily understand why there’s more conversation
about animal abuse today than in the past -— simply
more is being done to control the problem.

The other method to combat animal abuse is
through education programs primarily for children.
Humane education programs should be taught by in-
dividuals qualified as educators and dedicated to ani-
mal welfare. The program should be concerned more
with humane ethics than with a “cookbook” concept
of pet care.

Communication is vital to the success of humane
education — children need to feel free to discuss what
IS going on with a non-critical adult who can listen
and empathize. Showing strong feelings for an animal
can be cause for teasing by other children. On the oth-
er hand, kindness to animals can be the “in” thing. It

 

 

 

 

all depends on communication and dedication of the
teacher.

Children are not perfect; but if we set proper ex-
amples with our own actions, we’re likely to see a de-
gree of compassion and understanding toward ani-
mals. Children need to know that mankind doesn’t
live in this world alone -— there are other living crea-
tures. As man reshapes the environment for his own
comforts, animals become more and more dependent
on us for survival.

According to staff members of the Houston SPCA’s
education / investigation division, more than 90 per-
cent of all animal cruelty cases are a direct result of
ignorance or lack of respect for other life forms.

Teachers in the SPCA’s humane education out-
_reach program report that among their young stu-
dents:

Regrettably, there are many comments such as.
these that further enhance humane educators and in-

deficiency of emotional sensitivity.

I consider the bigger challenge is to get humane
education into an everyday learning experience.
More and more of the education and nurturing of chil-

Since November, 85 martens have

Forty-nine martens were released
in the Pigeon River ,Country State

 

Forest in November, according to
Doug Whitcomb, the forest’s habitat
biologist. Another 36 were released

Irvine, biologist for the Huron-

Martens were native to Michigan
but were forced out early this
century by trappers, who captured
them for their valuable fur, and
lumberjacks, who cut down the
animal’s natural habitat of mature
hardwood trees, Whitcomb said. A
native marten was last seen in

Service contracted with Ecological
Research Services of Boyne City to
trap the martens about 200 miles
north of Sault St. Marie, near
Chapleau, Ontario. Irvine said.

The state paid $26,000 of the
$31,000 project, Irvine said. About
half the martens brought to Michigan

About 20 are expected to bear

Veterinarians use lasers
to slash costs on surgery

Laser beams, already revolutionizing surgery on hu-

mans, are a hot new tool for veterinarians. Removing a

human’s bladder tumor with lasers costs $671, vs. $3,838 for
conventional surgery. And vets can realize the same cost-
cutting rewards, says Dr. Stephen Crane, a veterinary
specialist at North Carolina State University.

Plus, laser surgery often can be performed without
putting the animal to sleep and with less cutting, therefore
less recuperation time. A horse with an infected larynx, for
example, can be locally anesthetized and stand up while
doctors use a laser to zap away the infected tissue. The
horse goes home the next day. Otherwise, recuperation
would take weeks. ‘

order on branding cows

is ruled inhumane by judge

The Associated Press

ROCHESTER, N.Y. - The gov-.

ernment cannot force farmers to
brand cows on the face as part of
its $1.8 billion dairy herd reduction
program "because it has long been
public, policy to avoid unnecessary
cruelty, a judge says;

US. "District Judge Michael
Telesca' (in Wednesday changed his
April _4_ temporary restraining order
against the branding requirement to
a preliminary injunction, pending an
as-yet-unscheduled trial.

" ' The ruling does not prevent the
[1.8. Department of Agriculture
from continuing the program, but
puts it on hold because farmers
have been reluctant to brand their
cattle, 'said government attorney
Shalom Brilliant. _

j He said farmers could still vol-
untarily follow the buyout pro-
gram's hot-iron branding require-
ment, in which a 3-inch “X" is
burned on the cow’s cheek.

The Humane Society of Roches- ’

ter and Monroe County, which filed
alawsuit to challenge the face-
branding requirement. claims the
practice is inhumane and violates
state animal cruelty laws.

“It has long been the public pol~
icy of this country to avoid unneces-
sary cruelty to animals,” Telesca
Wrote. . . .. .

The dairy buyout program is de-
signed to reduce annual surplus
milk production by 12 billion pounds
by killing or exporting - about
950,000 dairy cows and 600,000 heif-
ers or calves-Nationwide, 39,534
farmers had submitted bids to the
USDA to liquidate their dairy herds,
and 13,988 of those bids had been
accepted.

'Federal officials say the face
branding is necessary so the cows
cannot be resold and slipped back
into production. A cow’s face is the
best place for the permanent brand
because it is easily spotted and gen-
erally considered to be reserved for
the government, they argue.

The program also has been chal-
lenged by the National Cattlemen's
Association, which has complained
that the additionalbeef going on the
market from the slaughter of dairy
cows has depressed prices. ‘

"The association has filed a law-

suit ”in federal court in Lubbock,

Texas. ‘

don’t know if the female turtle who 'made the

to come. The beachgoer who spotted the fe-
male turtle make the nest and lay her eggs did

before she returned to the sea, Caillouet said.

' For eight years, Ridley eggs —— the size of
ping-pong balls -— have been brought to Texas
from Mexico to “imprin ” them on Padre Is-
land sand. Biologist are in the process of try-
ing to prove the theory that turtle hatchlings
instinctively will return to the beach where
they hatch. . .

Caillouet estimates that it takes six to 13
years for a Ridley to sexually mature in the
wild. Since the program has been in effect for
eight years, he believes it is a reasonable time

,to see turtles crawling ashore to lay eggs.
; “The longer our turtles remain in the wild,
and the older they get the greater the chances

More research, breeding
, and land are necessary for
the cats’ survival, but
those needs are costly.

   

By ED DEITZ
Tribune Staff Writer

  

Without additional research and a lot
more money, the Florida panther will be
extinct in fewer than 14 years, a wildlife
expert predicted Wednesday.

If nothing happens to help the species
survive, “we will lose the panther by the
year 2000,” warned biologist William
Branan, director of Florida Defenders of
the Environment, which will host a two-
day conference on the panther todayand
Friday in Tallahassee.

The purpose of the conference, Branan
said, is “very basic: There are only about
two dozen panthers left. And there are at
least four or five (state and federal) agen-
cies involved in some way with the pan-
ther.

“They all have to respond to public
opinion, and we want everybody to know
that this is an urgent issue. It won’t wait.”

A lobbying effort?

Not really, Branan said.

 
  
 

That is being handled, he ex-
plained, by an umbrella organization
called the Everglades Coalition,

. which lists as some of its 17 mem-

: bers such groups as the National
Wildlife Federation, the Audubon
Society, the Sierra Club, the Wilder-

_ ness Society and Florida Defenders
of the Environment.

The conference is for the ex-
change of information and ideas “so
that we can draw up a matrix of op-
tions," Branan said.

“We don’t want to change all of
South Florida (the only remaining
habitat of the panther is the Ever-
glades), move all the people out, be-
cause we know that’s not realistic,”

conceded Branan, whose doctorate
Its in wildlife management.

“What we want is more research,
breeding and the purchase of land
that will allow the panther to multi.

‘ ply.”
In other words, he simplified, a
i lot of money.

And that’s asking a lot from a
state pressed to meet the needs of
the thousands of people who move
here each month, “but we think
we’ve got to try,” Branan said.

Facility could intrude on panther

ORLANDO (AP) -— A laser testing facility planned
by Martin Marietta Orlando Aerospace in south Orange

- County could intrude on the habitat of several rare ani-

mals, including the endangered Florida panther, state
game officials say.

The defense contractor has leased 5,120 acres from
the Britt Ranch to build an electro-optics testing facility
similar to one it operates on the neighboring Deseret
Ranch, Martin Marietta spokesman Bud Reid said.

“It’s not for any particular contract,” Reid said, add?
ing that “it could be SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative), it
could be various types of programs.”

SDI is President Reagan’s “Star Wars” defense pro-
gram. ‘

Reid said the company plans to develop 1 percent of
the property and employ 20 to 25 people “for the fore-
seeable future." - -

,But Martin Marietta has requested permission to
bring up to 800 employees to the facility and may ex-
pand the facility within 10 years.

“If business is good and we continue to make a profit
it is possible that we may want to develop more of that
land,” Reid said, adding, “I Just can't see that the small
amount of development we're planning there could pos-
sibly hurt anything."

But Chuck Tucker, a wildlife officer for the Florida
Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, said the pro]-
ect could damage the habitat of the red-cockaded wood-
pecker, the black bear and at least one Florida panther
that game officials have been tracking through Orange
and Osceola counties since early March.

“It’s got to have some kind of effect and I can’t see it
as a helping kind of thing,” he said. “There are some
real rare animals in that area.”

Tucker said the red-cockaded woodpecker and the
black bear are threatened species and the panther is en-
dangered. ,

An endangered species is one that is close to becom-

--——————.___...

ing extinct. A threatened species is one whose habitat is
being destroyed so quickly that it is close to becoming
endangered.

“There are only a handful of bears anywhere in this
county,” Tucker said. "There are larger populations in
other counties, but I've only seen one bear in this area
during the entire seven years We worked here."

Commission officers have been tracking a male pan-
ther through the Britt and Deseret ranches since March.
Earlier this month Deseret officials refused permission
for commission biologists to enter the sprawling ranch
owned by the Mormon Church.

Tucker, however, has photographed and made plas-
ter casts of tracks on Deseret. He was allowed on the
ranch because state law gives wildlife officers the power -
to enter private property in the line of duty.

Tucker said plaster casts of the panther’s tracks indi-
cate it could be the same cat identified in January in the ‘
Tosohatchee State Preserve in east Orange County.

“If it is the same cat, it could be the only panther liv-
ing outside of South Florida swamps," he said.

Commission biologists believe there are fewer than
50 panthers in the state.

Brad Hartman, director of environmental services
for the commission, discussed the project last week with
Martin Marietta officials. He said the company plans to
develop 1,250 acres to accommodate a row of buildings
and a clearing large enough to test lasers. Hartman said
Martin also wants to build a road to the facility.

“The conversations with Martin are in the early
stages,” Hartman said. "We have not begun to study the
area to judge what kind of impact we can expect here."

Hartman said commission biologists will study the
area's animal population once Martin Marietta files a
written request. The game commission's tests could pre-
vent the development lf they decide it would irrevers-
ibly damage the habitat, he said.

SILVER SPRINGS — The Silver

wide open ranges of a Western cattle

ranch, but there’s a roundup, of

sorts, under way here.

A monkey roundup.

Park officials have set traps on
one bank of the crystal-clear river
that winds through this famous Flor-

accused of vandalism and attacks on
pets and people.

The monkeys have taken to
roaming off park grounds, where the
incidents reportedly have occurred,
Hill said.

But a University of Florida an-
thropology professor, Linda Wolfe,
said she has studied the monkeys for
years and sees no reason to move
them. ~

Park officials said they never
have received any reports of the
monkeys attacking people on park
grounds. However, they will find a
new home for the monkeys to avoid
problems with the commission, mar-
keting director Dave Warren said
Wednesday. '

“We have to work with the com-
mission on a number of issues,”
Warren said, adding that park offi-

 

Park officials tried last year to
move the northern bank monkeys to
the southern bank, but they swam
back across the river to their origi-
nal home once they were set free,
Brown said.

“They are territorial,” she said.
adding that the southern bank mon-

keys dldn’t get along with those from ,

the other bank. .

The latest monkey roundup
began Tuesday, Warren said, but it
will take at least several weeks to
trap the northern bank monkeys be-
cause they are intelligent and wary.

He said the park is looking for a
zoo or some other facility that can
take all 80 of the monkeys, because
the park doesn’t want to split up the
group.

Wolfe has studied the primates
at Silver Springs since 1980. She said

there's no need to move the mon-
keys. and by doing so, the state is
“depriving the people of a part of
Central Florida heritage.”

The monkeys will attack, she
said, but only if provoked.

“There is no evidence that the
monkeys are particularly danger-
ous,” she said, adding that all ani-
mals will attack if provoked. She ac-
cused the game commission of
spreading “horror stories” about the
rhesus monkeys to put pressure on
the park to remove them.

But Hill said the animals are
easily provoked and even one attack
“is too many. We're looking at the
safety factors involved.”

Local legend holds that the mon-
keys were left behind after the film-
ing of some “Tarzan” movies on the
Silver River in the 19305.

But Wolfe said the monkeys were
brought to the river in 1938 by a
Capt. Tooey, who operated a river
cruise.

cials want to maintain a good work-
ing relationship with the agency.

He said the national Humane
Society is helping the park find a
new home for the monkeys. He said
the park will not sell or give the pri-
mates to any research labs, a prob-
lem two years ago when the monkey
population was too high and the
commission first ordered the evacu-
ation of northern bank monkeys.

Hill said at that point the com-
mission had received 17 complaints
about the monkeys attacking people
or pets, and vandalism complaints
also had been lodged against the pri-
mates.

The park agreed to move them
then, and trapped 217 monkeys,
which were sold to a “reputable

dealer,” said Georgia Brown, park
public relations manager. That firm,
in turn, sold the monkeys to a re-
search lab, resulting in protests from
animal rights groups.

This time the 80 northern bank
monkeys will not be relocated until
the new home is approved by the
Humane Society, Warren said.

“I don’t think we can do much
better than that for a recommenda-
tion,” he said.

The park will be left with about
100 rhesus monkeys on its southern
bank. Those monkeys, officials said,
have not been a problem because
they haven’t roamed off park prop-
erty.




  

 
    
     
       
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
        
  

THE BOSTON GLOBE - April 21, 1986

Zoo takeover eyed

Tufts could replace
MDC’S management

 

By Bonnie V. Winston
Globe Staff

Negotiations are in progress with
Tufts University to take over the man-
agement of Franklin Park Zoo in Dor--
Chester and the Walter D. Stone Memori-
al Zoo in Stoneham.

While many details need to be worked
out, William J. Geary, commissioner of
the Metropolitan District Commission,
which runs the zoos, said he expected
Gov. Dukakis and several key legislators
to make an announcement next month
on the management change.

“They will announce a fundamental
improvement” on how the zoo is run,
Geary said. “It is the first time in 13
years that we have all the key players —
the governor, the Legislature, the MDC,
Tufts and the Boston Zoological Society -
focusing on working together to improve
the circumstances at the zoos,” he said. 4, .. , ,,

He said several discussions have tak-
en place between him, Geary. Dukakis
and several other officials, including Dr.
Franklin Loew, a board member of the
zoological society and dean of Tufts’
School of Veterinary Medicine. 2008, Page 20

    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 
   
       
    
    
   
        
   
    
 
  
      
       

Loew said last week that he and other
university officials are putting together a
plan to present to the university’s board
of trustees, which, he said, would deter-
mine the school’s involvement.

“The request wouldn’t be summarily
dismissed,” Loew said. But, he said, the
board would have to be assured that ade—
quate money would be available to run
the zoos properly,

If Tufts runs the zoos, it would
be the first university in the coun-
try involved in zoo management.

The question of adequate fi-
nancing has been a major one for
the MDC and the zoological soci-
ety. Officials of both groups recog-
nize that the zoos have fallen into
disrepair because of lack of fi-
nancing from the state. Atten—
dance has fallen to about 50,000
annually at Franklin Park and
about 500,000 annually at Stone

said.

tal of about 1,000 specimens,
many of which are on loan to oth-
er zoos because the local facilities
are inadequate to house them
properly.

The zoos operate on an annual
budget of about $3 million, of
which $1 million comes from the‘
zoological society, Bland said.
About $6 million is needed to run
them adequately, he and Geary
said.

“We want to break the vicious
cycle" of little money and result-
ing poor management, Geary said.

In an attempt to turn things
around, the MDC sought bids in
the fall for new management for
Franklin Park and Stone. But. of-
ficials said, only the zoological so-
ciety submitted a proposal. No
outside professional wanted to
come in because of the poor fi-
nancing, an official said.

Bland said the MDC did not ac—
cept the zoological society propos-
al to run the 200 because “they
said the Legislature needed a more

Bland said the zoos have a to- .

well-established organization to
run it.” That was when Tufts was
brought in.

Bland said Dukakis felt the
Legislature would commit more

money to the zoos if an organiza~

tion like Tufts would take over.

Geary said yesterday that the
MDC will ask legislators for a
small increase in operating funds
for the zoos in the 1986-1987 bud—
get, with a request for a more sub-
stantial increase toward the end
of the next fiscal year.

Loew said that if the university
gets involved, it might be phased
in over six months. ”I’m not sure
we could function by July 1," the
beginning of the state's fiscal
year, he said.

Several officials said this is a
critical time for the two zoos.
“We're at a point in Boston where
we either get the magic formula to
get the funding to make the zoos
what a major city's zoos should
be. or we should make the deci-
sion to get out of the zoo business
altogether," Loew said.

He said as dean of the eight-
year-old veterinary school, New
England’s only one, he was flat-.
tered that the university was
asked to help.

“My vet students will get an
enriched education by being able
to work on management problems
and diseases of animals in captiv-
ity,” he said. The zoos could also
be worked into the undergraduate
biology curriculum, he said.

“I see so many pluses." Loew
said. “But I also can see it as a
management nightmare. I'm will-
ing to say: Let's make a CODU’lbUr
tion as a university to get it run-

ning right."

The scarcity of chimps

By Judy Foreman
Globe Staff

cientists racing to develop a vaccine

against the deadly AIDS virus are run—

ning up against a problem that has

vexed a number of other researchers —

the scarcity of chimpanzees for vital
medical research.

Because chimps are among the closest ani-'
mals to man - many scientists believe they are-
man‘s closest relative —- they are invaluable as
the final pre—human stage of testing. Each new
batch of live Hepatitis B vaccine, for instance,
must be tested in chimps before being given to
humans.

And in the case of AIDS, no other animal —
not even other apes — can be as reliably infected
. with the AIDS virus.

But chimps can be used only as test animals
of last resort - and then only after considerable
care and planning and at high cost -— because
they are an endangered species. '

For more than a decade, many countries, the
United States included, have been trying to pro-
tect the world’s remaining chimps by banning
all exports and imports of the animals under a'
treaty called the Convention on International:
Trade in Endangered Species.

Although there are an estimated 50,000 to?
100,000 wild chimpanzees left in Africa, the ex-,
port/import ban and the difficulty of getting;
chimps to breed in captivity has meant thatI
there are only about 1200 chimps in research fa—
cilities in this country, plus a handful in zoos i

Those chimps are used not only for testing
vaccines but for investigating rare viral dis-:
eases, research in gene therapy and for a variety
of experiments in learning. behavior and repro-
duction. They are housed mainly in five univer--
sity or government research colonies. in New;
Mexico, Texas, Louisiana and New York, at a
cost of about $6000 a year for each animal, notes
Nate Flesness, head of the Minnesota based In—I
ternational Species Inventory Systems.

It can cost up to $20, 000 to use a chimp for a
year or two of research, says Flesness. After—
ward. each experimental animal must be main—
tained for the rest of its natural life, often as long
as 40 years.

Thomas Wolfle, executive director of the Na-
tional Institutes of Health inter—agency research
animal committee, says NIH is seeking congres~
sional approval of a $4 million a year program to
ensure a stable supply of breeder chimps for
long-term research projects. About half the mon-

ey would go toward maintaining 200 to 300
breeder chimps in the existing centers and the
other half for research into chimpanzee repro-
duction problems and neonatal mortality. So far.
Flesness says, even artificial insemination has
proved difficult with chimps.

- At best, adds veterinarian Jorg Eichberg at
the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Re-
search in San Antonio, a major chimp facility
can hope to raise 5 to 10 chimps a year —- for all
purposes. not merely AIDS research.

Even if the federal program is approved, adds
Flesness, it will not case the immediate chimp
shortage. At a conference this month in San
Francisco, Boston AIDS researcher Jerome
Groopman of New England Deaconess Hospital
said the chimpanzee shortage could delay hu-
man testing of an AIDS vaccine or mean that
chimpanzee tests would have to be conducted!
loverseas.

In addition to wrestling with availability and
cost problems, researchers are also confronting
increasingly vocal criticism from animal rights
activists who challenge the use and care of
chimps and other animals in research. So far,
however, the activists have not focused specifi-
.cally on AIDS research.

Despite the problems, scientists expect to in-
ject the first prototype AIDS vaccines into the
first of an estimated 200 chimps within the next
few weeks.

The prototype vaccines to be tried in chimps
have already been tested in other animals —.
mice, rabbits, goats, even the plentiful rhesus
monkeys— and found to elicit so- -called neutraliz-
ing antibodies, which researchers hope will pro—
tect the animals from infection by the AIDS
virus.

But the chimp trials are critical. because ofu
all the animals, only chimps (like people) "shed"'
the AIDS virus over long periods of time and
show actual symptoms of disease, such as swol-
len lymph glands. Because of this. only chimps
provide the “acid test” of a vaccine.

The vaccine to be tried in chimps is actually
only a piece of the outer core or envelope from.
the AIDS virus. Theoretically, this should stimu-J
late a protective immune response but be fairly
safe, because the whole virus is not involved.

The vaccinated chimps will be “challenged”
with live, whole virus. If the vaccine has worked,
the virus will be unable to get a foothold, the ex-
perimental chimps should remain totally
healthy. The next step would be to test the vac-
cine in human volunteers

 

Cell test may replace lab ranous

Researchers have found a new method with
which to measure the toxicity of chemicals in
cosmetics and household products that may re-
place the controversial Draize test, which uses
live rabbits. The new test, developed by research-
ers at the Eye Research Institute (ERI), uses liv-

ing cells grown in the laboratory rather than-
rabbits, which have been used by industry for 40 ,

years.

In the Draize test, chemical substances are.
applied to the eyes of live albino rabbits to deter-'

mine eye irritancy potential. The test has recent-

ly been the focus of criticism by many animal,

rights groups.
The new test uses cell cultures of rabbit cor-
neal tissue, grown in a culture dish, which are

“wounded” by mechanical means, and then
stained. Time-lapse photography tracks the rate
of cells closing the wound.

According to Arthur H.- Neufeld, head of the
Opthalmic Pharmacology Unit and director of re-
search at Boston—based ERI. the new method
alone is not as effective as the Draize test.

“Because it uses live animals, the Draize test
measures toxic effect upon the entire organ, the
eye. A battery of alternative [chemical] tests will

be needed to cover the full range of irritant re—7
sponses for many compounds and thus ultimate—

ly improve on the Draize test,” Neufeld said.

TAMPA TRIBUNE - April 25, 1986

Options offered,
but hope slender
for Florida panther

\ symposium is under way to develop “a
natrix of Options” in an effort to save the last
nembers of the subspecies in the world.

2y ED DEITZ
7ribune Staff Writer

TALLAHASSEE — Scientists and
aureaucrats met on common ground
:ere Thursday to paint for each
‘ther their picture of the Florida
ranther.

It wasn’t pretty.

The two dozen remaining ani-
nals — confined now to the Ever-
glades — are sick, their reproduc-
ave abilities are weakened by gener-
..tions of debilitating in-breeding and
here isn’t enough food to go around.

They’re shot by hunters and
hey’re crushed by cars, and if the
state of Florida ever comes up with
anough money to make things right
or the big cat it might be too late.

Those are only a few of the
trokes applied Thursday by a group
.f people who are meeting here to
levelop, as one biologist calls it, “a
natrix of options” to prevent the
zanther from becoming extinct.

Extinction is close, those at the
.neeting agreed, “but we musn’t give
1p hope,” said Marjorie Carr, presi-
ient of Florida Defenders of the En-
vironment, the organization that’s
sponsoring the two-day symposium.

“The majority of people in Flor-
ida want to live with these animals,”
she said in her remarks that opened
the meeting "They add a color to
our lives and make life in Florida
exciting.”

People, however, may be the
cat’s worst enemy.

Melody Roekle, a University of
Florida veterinarian who has con-
ducted extensive studies of the pan-
ther, said that of the 21 dead ani-
mals she has examined, 15 were
killed by cars and five more were
shot by hunters.

0f the live panthers she has ex-
amined, 85 percent carried a deadly
virus called panleukopenia along
with bloodsucking hookworms.

And as if that weren’t discourag-
ing enough, she said, recent tests on
male panthers show that 94 percent
of each animal’s sperm is incapable
of fertilizing a female.

Such a low percentage is the re-
sult of generations of in-breeding, a
condition that she said also results in
“high mortality rates for young pan-

thers and an astonishing sUSCEptibilT‘

ity to disease.”

But proper nutrition may be a
partial cure, she said.

Animals that live north of Alliga-

tor Alley are bigger and stronger
than those that live south of the high-
way, she said. A major reason for
that is because those to the north
“are obtaining 75 percent of their
food from large prey items, such as
deer, while those to the south obtain
90 percent of their food from small
prey items, such as raccoons and ar-
madillos,” Roekle said.

Deer is the panther’s favorite
food, and a steady diet of deer,
which need to be chased and killed
far less frequently than smaller
prey, strengthen the cat’s chances
for a long and healthy life, said John
Eisenberg, a professor of ecosys-
tems conservation at Florida State
University’s School of Forest Re-
sources. Hunters and housing devel-
opments have lowered deer popula-
tions, said Eisenberg and biologist
William Branan, but not so low that
those numbers can’t be increased.

Branan, who is director of Flor-
ida Defenders of the Environment,
said he thinks a different wildlife
management technique for Ever-
glades deer — one that would allow
the animals to reproduce "to their
maximum carrying capacity per
acre,” would be “beneficial to the
panther and the hunter alike.”

He said, however, that he doesn’t
know what that number is, “maybe
five to 10 deer per acre,’ and thinks
it warrants more research.

Another area for research, two
other speakers said Thursday, is the
idea of introducing a healthier rela-
tive of the panther — cougars from
the Western United States or South
America, for example —- to the
Everglades so that they could begin
breeding a hardier brand of pan-
ther.

Speakers Tommy Hines, a super-
visor of the state Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission’s Gaines-
ville research laboratory, and Tom
Logan, chief of wildlife research for
the commission, agreed that such a
concept should be approached with
“great care,” as Logan put it, “be-
cause what we have here is distinct
and unique from other mountain
lions and it’s important for us to
maintain it as a 3:-~tinct subspecies
for as long as we ran.”

“”"The‘ conference resumes this

morning with a <peech by Gov. Bob
Graham and the display of a captive-
born panther by Bert Wahl of Tam-
pa’s Wildlife Rescue.

 

 




 

 

lMarchers mourn lab tests on animals

Demonstrations were
held nationwide as part of
the third World Day for
Laboratory Animals.

Downtown office workers on their
way to lunch Thursday watched about 75
demonstrators march by carrying plac-
ards bedecked with bloodcurdling pic-
tures of laboratory animals.

“Butchers," one read, with that word
in red capital letters, “experiment on

Animal rights activist Raini Sequoya
of Tampa led the march. Behind him a
drummer beat a slow cadence for the
marchers, who included six black-hooded
pallbearers carrying a coffin.

Thursday was the third annual World
Day for Laboratory Animals, Sequoya
told his followers at a rally before the
march. “Brothers and sisters,” he called
the animals, while others referred to
them as “non-human animals.”

In observance of the day, hundreds of
people marched peacefully on campuses
and at laboratories across the nation to
protest using animals for “gruesome" ex-
periments.

At least 79 people, most of them in
California, were arrested for blocking ac-

Animal research credited

for lifesaving advances

Research on animals is
necessary before research can
be done on humans, a USF
professor said.

Tribune Staff Writer

Insulin treatment, chemotherapy, organ trans-
plants, inoculations, microsurgery techniques,
bone marrow transplants 7

All are lifesaving medical advances that would
have been impossible without the use of animals as
research tools, according to a wide array of medi-
cal researchers and practitioners.

“People are always asking ‘What’s the justifica-
tion for using animals in research?’ ” said Univer-
sity of South Florida researcher Joseph Krzanow-
ski, who is professor and vice chairman of pharma-
cology and therapeutics.

“The justification is that we have to have a firm

basis before we proceed to do research on humans.
There really is no other way we can get this in-
formation.”
_ While animal rights activists suggest that tissue
cultures and computer models can be used in
place of laboratory animals, Knanowski responds
that “tissue culture doesn’t have hearts that beat
and computers can’t see.

 

“There comes a time when one has to test (the
research) in a living system.”

About 90 percent of laboratory animals used in
the United States are rats, mice and other rodents
supplied by licensed breeders for research pur-
poses, according to the Foundation for Biomedical
Research, a non-profit educational organization
based in Washington, DC.

Among the other species used in research are
dogs and cats, some of which are bred for the pur-
pose while others are supplied by community
pounds.

In 1983, the latest year for which national
statistics are available, between 17 million and 22
million animals were used for research and testing
in this country, according to the Office of Tech-
nology Assessment, a research arm of Congress.

The USF College of Medicine uses about 20,000
animals in research each year.

In Hillsborough County, the pound sold 572
dogs and 277 cats to USF for research purposes in
fiscal 1984-85, a spokeswoman said. Those animals,
sold for a nominal charge, were abandoned or un-
claimed and represented 3.4 percent of the almost
25,000 animals impounded last year.

In contrast, 76 percent of pound animals in the
county (more than 19,000) were destroyed in the
same period because they were not retrieved by
owners or were not adopted.

The Hillsborough County Commission has no

immediate plans to revisit its policy
of making pound animals available
to USF, Commissioner Jan Platt
said.

“As long as there is a need for
animals in research at the Univer-
sity of South Florida, they will be
available from the pound. Humans
come first,” she said.

Hillsborough and Clay are the
only counties in Florida that cur-
rently sell pound animals for re-
search purposes.

Duval County formerly supplied
pound animals to the University of
Florida, but recently halted the
practice in the face of vocal protests
from animal rights activists.

Dogs were to have been used in a
research project at the University of
Florida to test the effectiveness of
the Heimlich maneuver on drowning
victims. Researchers proposed anes-
thetizing the dogs and filling their
lungs with water to simulate drown-
ing. The project subsequently was
rejected as unnecessary.

Although Clay County joined
Duval in suspending use of its pound
animals for university research, it
resumed supplying the animals last
month. .

In research, as in any other area
of life, there are bound to be Some
mistakes and abuses, Krzanowski
said. But USF has ”a clean shop” in
which animals are humanely shel-
tered and fed and are anesthetized
throughout research procedures, he
said.

USF’s animal laboratory is in-

spected periodically by the US. De- V

partment of Agriculture and is ac-
credited by the American Associa-
tion for Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care. All animal labs in the
country are governed by the federal
Animal Welfare Act, passed in 1966
and updated last year to assure ap-
propriate research uses and ade-
quate care of animals.

Krzanowski, a dog owner, said it
would be ideal if researchers could
produce the same results without the
use of animals.

“But I think there are just some
questions that can’t be answered
without a living subject,” he said.
f‘The animal has something to con-
tribute to humankind as well (to) the
animals.”

Authorities who defend the use
of animals in research point out that
the resulting medical advances
benefit animals as well as humans.
Bone disorders, renal disease and
other maladies in household pets
can be treated successfully as a re-
sult of medical techniques de-

 

veloped for humans, they say.

Gail Morales, president of the 76-
member Hillsborough County Vet-
erinary Society, agreed that animals
are beneficiaries of research and
said she supports USF’s use of labo-
ratory animals.

“Biomedical research is neces-
sary. We conduct it with the knowl-
edge that we’re going to help man-
kind and animals,” she said.

Organizations that support USF’s
research efforts are numerous and
include the Hillsborough County
Health Department, the Hillsbor-
ough County Medical Association
and the Hillsborough County Pediat—

> ric Society.

The Florida affiliates of the
March of Dimes, American Cancer
Society, American Diabetes Associa-
tion and the American Heart Associ-
ation also support USF’s use of re-
search animals.

Ed Geasa, president of the 100-
member Tampa chapter of the A12-
heimer’s Disease and Related Disor-
ders Association Inc., said his chap-
ter supports research using animals
because so much work is still
needed to unlock the causes and pos-
sible cures for Alzheimer’s.

“If someone wants to do some-
thing humane for animals,” he said,
“they can do something to reduce
the number that are abandbned and
turned loose.” '

Protesters targeted facilities in
California, Arizona, New York,
Nevada, Pennsylvania, Florida,
Washington state, Michigan and
Minnesota.

In Gainesville, University of
Florida medical center spokes—
woman Arline Dishong said extra se-
curity was added around the animal
labs and animal research farm, but
there were no demonstrations.

In February, researchers at the
, UF medical center drew protests for
proposed experiments on 22 dogs to
test whether the Heimlich maneuver
would help near-drowning victims.
The proposal was never carried out.

In Tampa Thursday, the march- ‘

, ers likened experimentation on live

animals to Nazi atrocities. Pulling a
computer printout from the coffin,
Sequoya stood on the steps of the
Hillsborough County Courthouse and
‘read off a “roll call of death.”

“Rhesus monkey, tattoo number

he rode an escalator up to where the
County Commission meets and left
the wreath in the empty room.

Courthouse employees, hearing
the sound of reporters stampeding
down the hall behind Sequoya,
poked their heads out of offices to
watch.

Sequoya’s followers in the march
included Charles Santora, 617, who
said he belonged to every- animal
welfare group he knew of, from
Greenpeace to the Humane Society.

“If people don’t have empathy
for all creatures, we’ll never stop
wars,” he said. ~

Sherry McKenzie carried her
chihuahua, Gator -— all two pounds
of him. This was her first appear-
ance in a demonstration.

“I know this isn’t going to stop it,
but it might help,” she said-

Sequoya and other speakers at
the rally contend that research using
live animals is inefficient, wasteful
of taxpayers’ money and cruel. They
talked of a spiritual kinship between
species, and said animal physiolo-
gies are not similar enough to that of
humans to justify using them for re-
search. 3

“If it really did work, we”Amer-
icans would have eternal life by
now," one of the speakers said.

That brought applause from the
audience accompanied by loud bark-
ing from two of the marchers, black
Labrador retriever mixes named
Boswell and Maxwell. ..

Nobody tried to interfere with
the marchers.

After the half-hour march, Se-
quoya held aloft a bunch of black
plastic roses and shouted, “May they
soon cease to be victims.” Then he
and the others knelt around the cof-
fin in front of the courthouse and
prayed. I

MDC, Tufts engage in talks

on takeover of two zoos

I 2005
Continuedfrom Page 19

If Tufts runs the Zoos, it would
be the first university in the coun-
try involved in zoo management.

The question of adequate fi-
nancing has been a major one for
the MDC and the zoological soci—
ety. Officials of both groups recog-
nize that the zoos have fallen into
disrepair because of lack of fi-
nancing from the state. Atten—
dance has fallen to about 50,000
annually at Franklin Park and
about 500,000 annually at Stone
Zoo “during a good year,” Bland
said. .

Bland said the zoos have a to- .

tal of about 1,000 specimens,
many of which are on loan to oth-
er zoos because the local facilities
are inadequate to house them
properly.

The zoos operate on an annual
budget of about $3 million, of
which $1 million comes from the
zoological society, Bland said.
About $6 million is needed to run
them adequately, he and Geary
said.

“We want to break the vicious
cycle” of little money and result-
ing poor management, Geary said.

In an attempt to turn things
around, the MDC sought bids in
the fall for new management for
Franklin Park and Stone. But. of-
ficials said, only the zoological so—
ciety submitted a proposal. No
outside professional wanted to
come in because of the poor fi-
nancing, an official said.

Bland said the MDC did not ac—
cept the zoological society propos-
al to run the zoo because “they
said the Legislature needed a more

well-established organization to
run it." That was when Tufts was
brought in.

Bland said Dukakis felt the
Legislature would commit more
money to the zoos if an organiza-
tion like Tufts would take over.

Geary said yesterday that the
MDC will ask legislators for a
small increase in operating funds
for the zoos in the 1986-1987 bud—
get, with a request for a more sub-
stantial increase toward the end
of the next fiscal year.

Loew said that if the university
gets involved. it might be phased
in over six months. "I’m not sure
we could function by July 1," the
beginning of the state’s fiscal
year, he said.

Several officials said this is a
critical time for the two zoos.
“We're at a point in Boston where
we either get the magic formula to
get the funding to make the zoos
what a major city's zoos should
be, or we should make the deci-
sion to get out of the zoo business
altogether," Loew said.

He said as dean of the eight-
year-old veterinary school, New

England's only one, he was ﬂat—.

tered that the university was
asked to help.

“My vet students will get an
enriched education by being able
to work on management problems
and diseases of animals in captiv-
ity," he said. The zoos could also
be worked into the undergraduate
biology curriculum. he said.

“I see so many pluses." Loew
said. "But I also can see it as a
management nightmare. I'm will-
ing to say: Let's make a contribu:
tion as a university to get it run-

ning right."

Exp carts a is a

By ANN L. HUNTINGTON, D.V.M.

 

I’m frequently asked by parents (and parents-to-be)
what a pet might do for their child. Although I am a
mother, I certainly don’t consider myself a child expert
— just a pet expert. Whether or not you get a pet for a
child deserves careful, professional study and discus-
sion. So, I sought the aid of the Pets Are Wonderful coun-
cil (PAW) and their roster of highly qualified experts in
the fields of child and family psychology.

The first thing I
learned was that I was ASk Your Vet
“Qt exploring Virgin "*,.}Ls_f¢,
territory. The maga- ' ‘ ’ ' ' '
zine Psychology Today had done a’survey of 13,000
readers, and 97 percent believed that kids should grow
up with pets. However, PAW research also found that
there are many myths about pets and children. T o cite
just a few:

A family should not acquire a pet until the children
are old enough to take full responsibility for it. The fact
is that very young kids can help take care of the family
pet; they should not be expected to take on full responsi-
bility at too young an age, but having them perform sim-
ple tasks is an excellent, fun way to teach them some re-
sponsibility. Thus, it’s smart for a parent to acquire a pet
when a child is very young, so that the child will start
learning early on about the joys of caring and the con-
comitant responsibilities. My personal experience cer-
tainly Confirms this: My 2-year—old son has been feeding
our cat, Wendel, for a full year now and enjoys the
“chore.”

Another “mythtaken” notion: One should never
leave a child alone with a dog. With a ferret this would
be true, but a well-trained dog can be a kid’s friend, pro—
tector and alarm signal if there’s trouble. However, the
child should not be allowed to roughhouse with the dog,
. should respec its nap and eating times, and very young
children shou d be taught how to gently pet and touch
the dog.

A half myth: Pets become jealous when a new baby
joins the family. It’s a half myth because there is the
possibility of jealousy on a dog’s or cat’s part unless
proper preventive steps are taken. Prior to bringing a
newborn home, introduce the baby to your pet indirectly
by letting it sniff one of the baby’s blankets. Then, when
baby does come home, hold the child in your arms and
let the pet sniff the real thing. But be sure to lavishly pet
your pet at the same time, so he knows that the new
baby is not going to diminish your affection for him.
Proper introduction avoids possible “sibling” rivalry.

Aline Kline, professor of psychology at Mills College

in California, conducted a study of 300 children ranging
in age from 3 to 13. They were asked how they felt about
their relationship with their dog or cat. Thirty percent of
the children cited the psychological benefits with re-
marks like: “My cat makes me happy,” or, “comforts me
when I’m sad,” or, “keeps me from feeling lonely.” A 9-
year-old said: “My dog’s a real friend; he knows when
I’ve had a bad day at school and Mom’s mad at me.”

On a sad note, in tune with our times, a 7-year-old
child of a divorced couple said, “When I’m at Dad’s, the

Ninety-four percent of the children said, with no

hesitancy, that they love their pet. Some of ’them main-
tained that their dogs reply, “1 ‘love you, too, when they
told the animal they loved him.

Two older boys said somewhat poignantly, “I tell my
ld talk back.”

One conclusion that can be drawn from this study: A

pet certainly can do a lot of good for a kid —— and in
more ways than one.

By Ellen Futterman
Of the Postsoiepatch Staff

HEN Mike, the precocious canine in the movie “Down
and Out in Beverly Hills” repeatedly refuses to eat, a
pet psychiatrist is summoned to analyze the pup’s problem.

The audience snickers at the suggestion. Come on, a dog
psychiatrist? But the concept isn’t a figment of Hollywood’s
active imagination. Folks such as Warren Eckstein earn
quite a comfortable living traveling throughout the country
curing pets of their depression, assorted phobias and, yes,
even anorexia.

“People say to me all the time, ‘Warren, an anorexic pet,
are you kidding?’ ” said Eckstein, an animal therapist who
says he has treated more than 30,000 panicky pets. "They’re
not going to throw up after a meal on purpose or take
medication to help them lose weight. But if pet owners are
overly conscious about their food intake, it’s quite possible
that they’ll transfer that behavior onto their animal.

“Pets suffer many of the same problems as humans do.
And, like humans, the best way to resolve an animal’s
problem is to bring it to the surface and confront it.” With
an anorexic dog, for example, Eckstein suggests several
small feedings a day “that are presented with great
fanfare.”

“The meals should contain regular, well-balanced pet -
food mixed with something tempting, such as' a bouillon
cube dissolved in water or a little Parmesan cheese or
cottage cheese on top,” Eckstein said. “Show the bowl of
food to the pet, keeping it a little out of his reach, with a
blatant invitation such as, ‘Oh, this is for you? What a
wonderful surprise! I’ll bet you can’t wait!’ Then place it in
front of him.”

Eckstein also instructs pet owners to allow their animals
to examine and eat the food as they desire —— without any
pressure. If an animal doesn’t eat well for the first several
days of therapy. maybe he will later on in the week.

“A picnic in the open air or a trip to the beach might -
help," he said, “but be sure not to make the dog or cat run
five laps around the picnic area before you feed him. Too
much exercise is definitely ill advised for an anorexic pet.”

Eckstein has treated many an anorexic pet and even
devotes a chapter of his book, “Understanding Your Pet”
(Henry Holt and Co., $16.95), to animal appetite disorders.
Other chapters explain how to deal with pet neuroses,
housebreaking mistakes and sexual problems.

“Yes. dogs do have sexual problems although they’re not
the same as humans’,” he said matter-of-factly. “For
example, when a dog mounts your leg, he is displaying
dominant behavior. There is another way of resolving that
besides cold showers for the dog. Increased exercise is one
way to deal with it; not paying a whole lot of attention to it is
another.”

 

 

 

 

Mike, the antagonistic, anorexic canine star of
“Down and Out in Beverly Hills,” is a patient of a
pet therapist in the movie.

Eckstein came to St. Louis recently to promote a program
sponsored by Ralston-Purina Co. and area humane societies.
“The Pets for People” program is designed to encourage
children to become responsible pet parents.

Young participants receive a colorful cartoon-like
handbook that explains the proper care and feeding of pets.
Successful pet parents can send away for rewards such as
Frisbees, leashes and dog or cat collars.

“I decided to get involved with this project because it is an
all-win situation,” Eckstein said. “The children learn
responsibility and at the same time receive incentives, and
the homeless pets come out of the shelters. It also
encourages intelligent conversations between children and
their parents about pets.” ‘

Eckstein lives in Oceanside on Long Island, N.Y., but
travels frequently to Los Angeles where he is a regular
guest on TV’s “Hour Magazine.” His clients include pets
owned by celebrities such as Lily Tomlin, Cheryl Tiegs,
David Letterman, Rodney Dangerfield and Al Pacino. A
typical visit with the pet shrink runs between $200 and $500.

In this dog-eat-dog world, life can get to be too much, says
Eckstein, even for animals. “The anxieties and changing

lifestyles people face in the ’803 transfer to their pets, so
that dogs and cats feel many of the same stresses as their
owners,” he said. “Animals are highly attuned to the career
demands their owners face. Those tensions often travel
down the leash and affect the animal.”

Take for example the case of Tess, a Norwich terrier
belonging to comedian Lily Tomlin. Eckstein was called for
a consultation by Tomlin because Tess seemed overly timid
and shy.

“I said, ‘OK, Lily, it’s time to put Tess on the couch and
analyze the situation,’ ” Eckstein related. “Lily, as you

. probably can imagine, practices 20 different personalities a

day. One minutes she’s Ernestine, the telephone operator,
the next she’s a little girl licking a giant sucker.

“I said, ‘Lily, the dog has no problem. She just doesn’t
know who she lives with.’ I told Lily to put Ernestine and the
others into the closet for 15 minutes each day and just be
herself. I suggested she take Tess for a walk or a jog. She .
took the advice, and the problem worked itself out.”

Eckstein says that many of his clients are
upwardly mobile working people, often executives in two-
income families, who leave their animals alone during the
day. They feel guilty about not spending enough time with
their “latchkey” dogs and cats.

“I tell them that it’s not the amount or quantity of time
you spend with your dog or cat that’s important-i,- it’s the
quality of that time,” Eckstein said. “I tell them to spend 15
minutes of positive time with their pet every day.

“They should go for a jog or a walk or have a party for
their dog or cat. People say to me, ‘Come on Warren, a party

for my dog? Isn’t that eccentric?’ Well, there "are times
when women have to talk to other women and men have to
talk to other men and dogs have to talk to other dogs.

“Pet owners who are really busy can invite some of their

, friends over with their animals and while the owners play

bridge, the animals have an opportunity to mesh with their
peers and let out certain behaviors that they might not be
apt to do with a person.”

Eckstein also suggests leaving the television or radio
playing during the day so the animal is consistently hearing
voices and isn’t so lonely. He says this can be particularly
helpful if a pet suffers from “separation anxiety,” fear of
being away from his or her owner.

Speaking of separation, Eckstein noted that divorce is a
big contributor to dog and cat neurosis. He related the story
of a recently divorced woman who called because her dog
wouldn’t allow her to date.

After an interview - Eckstein likes to sit down with both
the owner and pet to assess the situation —- he discovered
the ex-husband had always been rough on the dog, and the

dog transferred that hostility to all
men.

“We had to desensitize the dog to .
his dislike of men,” Eckstein ex- '
plained. “We had the owner play tape
recordings of men’s voices while she
stroked her dog, we suggested that
she introduce the dog to men on more
neutral territory than the home and
that she take the dog for walks down- '
town during lunchtime when plenty
of men were in the streets.”

In true Dr. Dolittle tradition, Eck-
stein actually talks to the animals he
treats. During his visit to St. Louis, he
went nose to nose with a black Labra-
ldor puppy who seemed to be a bit
camera shy. To relieve the dog of his
nervousness, Eckstein planted a juicy
kiss on the pooch’s cold nose. (Hugs
and kisses were part of the advice the .
dog psychiatrist offered the family in 6
:‘Down and Out in Beverly Hills.” 3'

Richard Dreyfuss, who played the ‘
‘husband in the movie, was appalled
at the suggestion.) - é

“I am a firm. believer in hugs and
kisses for dog's and cats,” Eckstein ‘
said. “Contrary to what everyone tells
you, I don’t think rewarding a dog
with a biscuit is the way to go. I have
yet to see one dog give another a ,
biscuit when something is done right. i
It’s a hug and a kiss.

“In fact, there are times when I’m
walking down the street and I’ll no-
tice someone walking a cute dog, and,
instinctively, I’ll bend down to kiss m
the dog. Only 10 minutes later do I
wonder what the heck people think of f ~ ;
me.” ‘ ~ "

species recently became extinct, and another is
@1986, National Geographic News Service

E WAS HANGING upside-down in a tree beside a
street lamp at night in a town on East Africa’s Lake
Victoria. .

Fluffing his white shoulder fur, he puffed out his
cheek pouches, fanned his wings and made repeated
gonglike calls to attract a mate.

He had a face like a dachshund’s, but he was actually
an epaulet bat.

Not far away stood Merlin D. Tuttle, one of the
world’s experts on bats and a specialist in wildlife
photography. For weeks he had been trying to
photograph an epaulet bat vocalizing in full courtship
display. Finally he had stumbled onto such a
demonstration.

Female epaulet bats apparently need light to see the
males’ courtship “dance.” The street lamps on the main
street of Kisumu, Kenya, allowed the males to court all
night, even on moonless nights.

Epaulet bats draw their name from long tufts of
white fur that sprout from their shoulders. During
courtship, the males use these long hairs and beating

wings to help waft glandular odors attractive to cruising '

females. Distinctive, too, are pouches in the males’
cheeks, inflatable sacs that act as resonance chambers
to enhance their calls.

Suitors in Kenya often continue their performance
past 3 am. In an eight-hour courting period, Tuttle
calculated, each male made more than 26,000 calls and
100,000 wing-beats. The actual mating took place late at
night in nearby trees. '

Epaulet bats are just one kind of flying fox, a group
representing about 200 of the nearly 1,000 bat species
on earth. Recent neurological and morphological
studies indicate that flying foxes actually may be
primates.

With wingspans ranging up to 6 feet, flying foxes play
a crucial part in plant reproduction in Africa, Asia, and
the Pacific islands, pollinating countless species as they
fly from flower to flower, sipping nectar.

They spread seeds, too, by their feeding habits,
ingesting fruit juice and expelling solid matter in ﬂight.
Wild fruit trees that rely on these bats for propagation
include bananas, plantains, dates, breadtruit, mangoes
and figs. Studies in West Africa show that flying foxes
also are crucial to reforestation of clear-cut areas,
leading to regrowth of valuable hardwoods.

But flying foxes are being eradicated at alarming
rates in many places. Population reductions of more
than 90 percent have been recorded in Australia,
Southeast Asia and some Pacific islands. Information is
so sketchy that some flying foxes are believed to be
facing extinction even before their endangered status
can be documented.

Fruit growers mistakenly believe that the bats are

stealing marketable fruit, but studies show the animals
take only fruit too ripe for harvest. In the process, they
deprive harmful fruit-fly larvae of food, said Tuttle,
who is working for protection (if flying foxes. .
In response to unverified fruit-grower complaints.
recent legislation in Queensland, Australia, places

flying foxes on the same pest list as the introduced rats.
mice and pigs, even though the bats are prime agents of

pollination of Australian hardwood forests.

endangered. Destruction of bats there
may be a cause of the demise of com-
mercial fruit-growing. '

In West African forests, ﬂying fox-
es are the only known seed-dispers-
ers for the iroko tree, whose timber is
worth millions of dollars annually.
The most important bat in the tree’s
regeneration is the straw-colored fly-
ing fox, which in many areas is also
considered a delicacy.

A shotgun blast can kill 20 to 60
roosting bats, and many more die of
wounds. Wiping out a single straw-

colored bat colony, Tuttle said, could
.affect forest regeneration over tens
of thousands of square miles.

The flying foxes known as epaulet
bats - vegetarians that navigate with
keen eyesight -- exhibit some of the
bat world’s most fascinating behav-
ior. If a disagreement arises among
males wooing females, they use their
wrists to box each other in harmless
tests of strength. _ -

Mother epaulet bats give birth to a
single baby once or twicea year. At
dusk, mothers carry their young with
them when they fly out to feed, even

though some are two-thirds the
weight of their mother and capable of
flying on their own.

The animals are gentle and can be

trained. But epaulet-bat behavior is
not easy to capture on film. At one
point in Kenya, Tuttle found himself
running through the night shaking
trees and yelling, trying toposition an-
epaulet bat for the cameras.

After hundreds of tries, he came
away with only a handful of quality
photographs and a strange reputation
among townspeople.

The other three cows followed,
one by one, quickly disappearing
into the black spruce surrounding
the lake.

The four caribou were part of g
the first load in a weeklong trans- 5
plant operation aimed at restoring
caribou to their traditional habitat
on the Kenai Peninsula southwest of
Anchorage. "‘

Caribou were plentiful there 100
years ago, but wildfires altered their .7
habitat and market hunters deci— Q
mated the herds at the turn of the %
century.

A transplant 20 years ago estab- ,
lished one small herd near Kenai -
and another of about 400 in the
mountains near Hope. Last year, 28
animals were released near Lake
Emma, and this year’s transplant is
designed to bolster that fledglirg
herd.

 

 

Using a net trap instead of tran-
quilizer darts and avoiding last
year’s transportation snarls, this
year’s transplant by state and fed-
eral biologists went more smoothly.

“This will revolutionize big-game
transplants in Alaska,” said Ted
Spraker, an Alaska Department of
Fish & Game biologist, after watch-
ing the nets fall on small groups of
caribou. _

Traditionally, Alaska biologists
have fired tranquilizer darts from
helicopters to capture big-game ani-
mals for study or transplant. This
year, they decided to experiment
with a net technique successful in
capturing deer and bighorn sheep in
Colorado.

fa. Then he pressed 3 red button on
his control unit, triggering blasting
caps wired to the rope supporting
the net. Before the caribou had time
to react, the eight-inch mesh net had
blanketed them. '

Schmidt said deer and sheep are
much more reluctant to walk under
the net. Many of the caribou never
even looked up.

A platoon of snowmobilers raced
to the netted caribou from their
waiting place on Lake Louise. Biolo
gists and local volunteers swarmed
over the bewildered animals, hold-
ing them down to keep them from
injuring themselves as they fought to
escape the net.

The caribou were hobbled, blind-
folded, sedated, loaded on sleds and
hauled to a staging area. The whole
process took about 30 minutes. Last
year, it often took that long to get a
single animal from the field to a cor-
ral.

At the staging area, blood sam-
ples were taken to test for disease,
and the caribou were given antibiot-
ics and a shot to rid them of para-
sites. Then they were put into indi-
vidual crates and loaded onto a
truck.

After a 300-mile trip to the Kenai
National Wildlife Refuge headquar-
ters in Soldotna, nine crates at a
time were lashed into a helicopter.

Mike Hedrick of the U.S. Fish &
Wildlife Service said a total of 52
caribou were moved during the
week. “We have 49 caribou that we
can count as living,” he said.

The total was almost twice the
number transplanted last year, with
far fewer fatalities. This year, six
caribou died during the transplant.

Plastic trash also dangerous
to sea animals, 501311 tists Warn

The Associated Press

PACIFIC GROVE — Plastic
trash in the oceans may endan-
ger sea animals as much as oil
spills, scientists warned yester-
day as they told how seals die
tangled in packing straps and
turtles choke to death on plastic
bags.

Non-degradable, floating plas-
tic debris —— cups, containers,
bags, straps, sheeting, aban-
doned nets and other fishing
gear —— “has a potential to be as
serious as any (ocean) pollution
problem today,” said David W.
Laist, an ecologist-analyst for

the U.S. Marine Mammal Com-
mission.

“On a global scale, it’s possi-
ble that the loss of animals to
plastics and (discarded) synthet-
ic netting is as great as the loss-
es due to oil and perhaps even
other toxic chemicals,” Laist
said during the Sixth Annual
Ocean Disposal Symposium.

The meeting, which ends Fri-
day, was sponsored by the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, the World Bank,
the University of California and
the U.S. Environmental Protec—
tion Agency.

Bear watchers protect
Alaskan oil drilling rigs

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) —
Figuring that polar bears can make
life a little too tense on drilling rigs,
at least one oil company has turned
to professional spotters to keep eyes
peeled for them and scare them off.

With a hair dryer to keep the
windows clear and a small stove to
ward off the Arctic cold, Mel Kee-
ney, 42, and Bob Jensen, 35, keep
watch for bears from a 4-by-4 shack
near a man-made drilling island at
Cape Halkett, about 100 miles north-
west of Prudhoe Bay.

' The two work for Polar Bear
Monitoring Services, a small busi-
ness started several years ago by
Fairbanks hunting guide Gary Wal-
lace, Keeney said. He said the firm
now employs about six monitors.
“We’re just hunters and fisher-
men and outdoorsmen,” said Kee-
ney, 42. “We’ve had close encoun-
ters with bears and learned differ-
ent ways to deal with them.”

There are few specific skills
needed for the job, but paramount is
the patience and attention span of a
stone. A polar bear monitor cannot
read or listen to the radio while on
his 12-hour shift. Instead, he scans
the horizon continually.

Amoco Production Co. pays the
monitoring firm $31 an hour to keep
the bears away from its rigs.

It decided the precaution was

necessary, especially in spring when

the bears’ main food supply — the
ringed seal —- starts popping up near
the drilling sites, said Wayne Smith,
Amoco’s Alaska manager.

Steven Amstrup of the US. Fish
and Wildlife Service has studied
polar bears in the Alaska arctic
since 1980.

He estimates there are about
2,000 polar bears on the ice pack be-
tween Point Barrow and Cape Ba-
thurst, Canada, an area as large as
about half of the continental United
States. That works out to about one
bear every 60 miles of sea ice, “so
the chances of bumping into a bear
are not all that great,” he said.

But the animals are curious and
totally unafraid, Amstrup said.
“They are clearly the toughest indi-
viduals in the valley and don’t have
to be concerned about, anything
else.”

The bears have not learned to
fear man, mainly because any bout
with a humans usually ends with a
dead bear, Amstrup said. He said the
animals must be respected because
of their strength and size, but that
they are not marauding killers.

If the bears and humans to co-
exist, they are going to have to learn
to share the ice, he said. Already, six
artificial islands have been con-
structed in polar bear territory in
the search for oil.

OAKLAND, CA TRIBUNE - March 28, 1986

} $60,000 zoo loan
prompts talk of 1 7
regional aid plan ‘

By John D’Anna
The Tribune

Oakland‘s financially
strapped Knowland Park Zoo
has secured a $60,000 short term
loan from Crocker Bank —- guar-
anteed by the city —— to help cov-
er general operating expenses
until June.

And 200 General Manager
Joel Parrott said yesterday it
may be "time to seriously consi-
der the possibility of turning the
200‘s focus to more of a regional
facility.” possibly under the aus-
pices 'of the East Bay Regional
Parks District. .

Such a move would ease the
- financial burden on the city
while giving the 200 the benefit
-of a two-county tax base, Par-
rott said. The zoo has an annual
capital and operating budget of
about $1.35 million, he said.

Turning the zoo into a regional

facility also would make sense
because roughly 60 percent of
the 200‘s 330,000 annual visitors
are not from Oakland, Parrott
said.

He said the issue will be stu-
died by a special panel that was
appointed by the Mayor Lionel
Wilson last week to explore fi-
nancial alternatives for the zoo.

The panel‘s first meeting is
expected sometime in the next
two weeks. Parrott said.

Wilson was out of town yester-
day and could not be reached for
comment on Parrott’s sugges-
tion, but Council member Carter
Gilmore, a critic of zoo manage-
ment, said such a proposal
“might be better for the city and
all concerned."

example, translated into a
$38,000 revenue loss, Parrott
said, adding that the zoo could
have been forced to close down
if a loan had not been approved.

He said revenues typically in-

crease in the spring and summer

months, and he expects the zoo
will be able to pay back the en-
tire loan by June 30.

Under the terms of the loan,

the 200 is expected to pay off ‘

half the loan in June and the oth-
er half by September.

Parrott said the interest rate
on the loan is one point above
Crocker’s prime rate, which cur-
rently is 9 percent. .

Debby McCormick of Crocker

Bank in Oakland confirmed the .

loan has been approved, but
would not discuss the terms of

Will gives estate to monkeys

PAIGNTON, England - An ani-

keys at a 200 here for 20 years has
left them nearly $600,000, the 200‘s
curator said Friday.

Marie Lefevre, a childless wid-
ow who died in July at age 84, left
almost her entire estate to the up-
keep and welfare of 120 primates at
Paignton Zoological and Botanical
Gardens in Devon, southwest Eng-
land. -

“She would bring them all sorts
of biscuits and tidbits and exotic
fruits, the likes of which these mon-
keys had never had before,” curator
Colin Bath said. “All hell would
break loose in the cages whenever

she arrived.”

Swan Song
for Whales
in Hawaii?

By RICHARD C. PADDOCK.
Times Staff Writer

LAHAINA, Hawaii—A baby
humpback whale, no more than 3
months old, rested with its mother
in the brilliant blue waters off the
coast of Maui. The calf, about 15
feet long, noticed an unusual crea-
ture floating near the surface:
researcher Deborah Glockner-
Ferrari in her snorkel, mask and
fins. _
Full of curiosity, the little hump-
back swam up for a closer look and
came within 10 feet of the diminu-
tive scientist, staring at her intent-
lv with its huge right eye. Quickly,

LOS ANGELES TIMES - April 25, 1986

Glockner-Ferrari snapped more
than a dozen photographs before
the calf’s 40-ton mother gently led
it away. .

“I think this little calf would
almost have let me touch him,” said
Glockner-Ferrari, whose photos
may later help identify the calf.
“There’s a specialness when you
look into their eyes. The calf didn’t
have any fear at all.”

Pioneer in Study

Glockner-Ferrari is a pioneer in
the underwater study of the hump-
back whale, a critically endangered
species. She and her husband, pho-
tographer Mark Ferrari, devote
their lives to this playful giant with
the wing-like flippers and the eerie
songs that can carry 15 miles
underwater.

If not for a humpback named
Humphrey, their work would be
known to only a handful of people.

Last October, the Ferraris in-
spired the dramatic rescue of the
errant whale that wandered .into
San Francisco Bay, swam up the
Sacramento River and got stuck in
a dead—end slough 70 miles inland.

iv Humhrey became an internation -

al celebrity and thrust the Ferrari
into the public Spotlight for nearly

, a. month.

Significant Discoveries

Since the 19705, the two 359
year-old researchers have spent
each winter in Hawaii swimming
with humpbacks and gathering da-
ta that could help save the species.
They pursue the whales using a
15-foot inflatable boat that would
fit inside the mouth of one of their
research subjects.

The Ferraris have no formal
scientific credentials. At times,
they have supported themselves
and their research by serving
cocktails or packing salami. Yet
they have made significant discov-
eries that have earned them a solid
reputation in the small community
of scientists who study whales.
Glockner-Ferrari, for example,
was the first to develop a reliable
method for determining the sex of
humpbacks and the first to prove

WHALES: HumpbacksMa y QuitHawaii

Continued from Page 1
that the species can reproduce
annually, not every two years.

“As a scientist, she is outstand-
ing,” said Roger Payne, a whale
biologist with the World Wildlife
Fund and a leading expert on
whales. “She is a very exceptional
individual and certainly one of the
better people at work on whales
today. She has done it in a com-
pletely unusual, offbeat way."

Now, the Ferraris are concerned
that the humpbacks are being
pushed out of their prime breeding
area off the coast of Maui by
growing tourist activity,
high~speed boating and the pollu-
tion spawned by a building boom
along the island's western shore.

They are worried that this could
further diminish the chances of
survival for the humpback whales
that inhabit the North Pacific
Ocean, estimated to number only
1,200. Altogether, scientists esti-
mate, there are 10,000 humpbacks
in the world, including populations
in the Atlantic Ocean and the
southern hemisphere.

Unlike the gray whale, seen
along the California coast in grow-

ing numbers, the humpback has
shown no measurable increase in
population in the 20 years since
whaling nations agreed to stop
hunting the species, federal biolo-
gists say. \

Since the slaughter ended, little
has been done to help the hump-
back recover.

In 1984, Hawaii Gov. George R.
Ariyoshi killed a federal plan to
create a sanctuary for the hump-
back whale—Hawaii’s official state
marine mammal. Opponents feared
that such a designation would in-
terfere with fishing, commercial
boating and the state’s all-impor-
tant tourist industry.

The National Marine Fisheries
Service, the federal agency re-
sponsible for protecting the hump-
back, has yet to begin work on a
recovery plan for the species or-
dered by Congress in 1978. Such a
plan could lead to the designation
of a critical habitat area for the
humpback as well as promote re-
search and public education.

In the Pacific, humpback whales
can spend eight months of the year
in US. territorial waters. Primarily
a coastal animal, the humpback's

annual migration from the Bering
Sea to the tropics covers 8,000
miles.

During the summer months,
members of the North Pacific pop—
ulation congregate off Alaska to
feed on herring, krill and other
small prey. In winter, Hawaii is the
giant mammal’s primary breeding
area, although groups have also
been observed off Baja California
and Japan.

Glockner-Ferrari, who once
rode dolphins as a trainer at a
marine park in Mississippi, was one
of the first to study the humpbacks
in their natural habitat when she
began swimming with them in
1975.

With a degree in biochemistry,
she came to Hawaii after she grew
sick of killing rats for laboratory
experiments at the University of
California, San Diego. Working as a
cocktail waitress at night and
swimming with the whales during
the day, she learned to recognize
individual whales by the unique
pigment patterns on their tails.

She met Mark Ferrari in 1979
when he came to Hawaii to photo-
graph whales. Ferrari, who has a

nearly a decade raising mountain
lions, and set three of them free in
the wilds of California.

The Ferraris were married that
year and began their cycle of
working in the off -season in Cali-
fornia to support their research in
Hawaii.

Glockner-Ferrari, quiet and shy,
handles most of the underwater
work and the theoretical side of the
research. Ferrari, more articulate
and outspoken, does a larger share

tailliink very highly of them person-

y.”

It was only by a quirk of fate last
October that Humphrey swam
within a dozen miles of the Ferrar-
is’ off -season home in Walnut
Creek. east of San Francisco.

The Ferraris were the first ex-

perts called in when the whale,
apparently lost and disoriented,
was sighted in the San Francisco
Bay. ‘
For nearly a month, they were
obsessed with saving Humphrey.
They organized the first attempts
at rescuing the wayward whale and
batticci the National Marine Fish-
eries SETVlce, which three times
halted efforts to herd the animal
downstream, preferring instead to
let nature take its course.

outpouring of Support

An outpouring of public support
for Humphrey persuaded the Fish.
eries Service to let the rescue
proceed. Dozens of boats and hun—
dreds of volunteers joined the ef—
fort to drive the whale to the ocean.
From their position in the rescue
fleet, the Ferraris watched in exul»
tation as Humphr y swam under
the Golden Gate Bridge to freedom.

In Hawaii, the Ferraris are. keepm
ing a close watch for Humphrey,

. who escaped from. California with-
out any of the tags or satellite
transmitters that National Marine
Fisheries Service biologists at-
tempted to attach. The researchers
should be able to recognize Hum-
phrey from the markings on its tail
and pectoral fins.

“There still is the. possibility he
may show up here—if not this year,
maybe next year.” Ferrari said.

The Ferraris, one of eight teams
operating under humpback re-

‘ search permits from the Fisheries
Service, are getting more support
this Lyear than ever—in part be-
cause of their role in the Humphrey
rescue. They expect to receive
$33000 in grants from federal and
private sources, and much of their
equipment has been donated or
loaned to them by corporate spon-
sors.

But the Ferraris have yet to
receive sufficient backing to be-
come year-round researchers and
follow the whales to their feeding
grounds in Alaska. Last fall, Fer-
rari worked at a factory in San
Francisco packing salami into
cardboard boxes—at times even
during the Humphrey rescue.

Each year, their fascination with
the humpbacks grows. They still
get excited each time they swim
with a whale or see one breach in
the distance.

“I think if you didn’t love the
whales, and you weren’t as sensi-
tive in your approach to the

whales, you wouldn’t be successful
in getting close to the whales,
which you need to be to take the
photographs,” Glockner-Ferrari
said.

Reaching 50 feet in length and
weighing as much as 40 tons, the
humpbacks are seemingly effort- _
less swimmers with the power to
move in bursts of speed up to 15
knots. The species was named
“humpback” by Whalers because
the animal’s dorsal fin often rises
high out of the water when it dives.

Many times, the Ferraris have

heard the singing of the humpback,
a sound so loud it is audible above
water and so intense underwater it
sends vibrations through the hu-
man body—even when the animal
is too distant to be seen.

The humpbacks’ song spans al-
most the entire range of human
hearing in gradually changing
themes of high and low-pitched
grunts and moans. Scientists have
found whales in different locations
singing the same song.

Over and over, the Ferraris have
seen the leviathans breaching—
leaping into the air and landing
with a tremendous crash of spray.
They have watched when school is
in sessicnnwhen calves only a few
months old breach awkwardly or
slap their pectoral fine on the
water’s surface in imitation of their
elders. .

Frequently, they have seen male
humpbacks fight for dominance,
ramming into each other at high
speed in struggles to determine
which will win the right to escort a
female. Male whales, battered and
bloody, have swarmed around the
Ferraris’ boat, battling in the
swirling waters—yet the Ferraris
have never been harmed.

In the water, the researchers
have been caught in a curtain of
bubbles created by an angry whale
in combat with a challenger. This
“bubble streaming" is a sign of
aggression and an effective method
of disorienting a foe or prey. It is
also one reason the Ferraris do not
use scuba gear, which sends out its
own stream of bubbles.-

One of their favorite whales is a
female they call Daisy. She recent-
ly returned to Maui with a new
calf—the sixth the Ferraris have
seen by her side in the last eight
years.

When they spotted her distinc-
tive white tail, the Ferraris shouted
with joy and slipped quickly into
the water—even though three
males were fighting over her near-
by. Daisy, seeming to show off her
new baby, swam in their direction

and allowed them to come within
five feet of the half.

It was Daisy and her offspring
who first showed the Ferraris that
humpbacks can breed every year.

 

  

  

Through their method of passive
observation, the Ferraris have
made other important contribu—
tions to the knowledge of the
species. »

Glockner-Ferrari was the first to
discover how to determine the sex
of a humpback by looking at its
profile. This in turn, helped the
Ferraris and other researchers un-
derstand far more about the behav-
ior of the animals. For example, the
Ferraris learned that whales fre-
quently seen escorting mothers
with calves‘are males, not female
“aunts” as had been believed.

The researchers also have found
a high correlation between white
’scar tissue and the fighting behav-
ior of males, which is what led "
them to believe there was an 80%
chance that Humphrey was a male.

' In studying calves, the Glock-
her-Ferrari discovered that pig-
ment patterns on the flukes, which
are used to identify adult whales,
change as the young whales grow,
making that method useless in
recognizing them in later years. So
she developed a new method of
identifying these whales by the
pattern of grooves that line the
outside of their mouths.

But what causes the Ferraris to ?
worry is their finding that the
whales seem to be abandoning the
waters close to the Maui shore.

Between 1977 and 1979, 80.3% of
the females and calves they photo-
graphed were within a quarter-
mile of shore. By 1985, that number
had dropped to 5.8%. Last year,
83.7% of the mothers and calves
were sighted more than a. mile from
land.

May Disappear

“Now they seem to move more
often and they are not resting for as
long intervals,” Glockner-Ferrari
said. “We are really concerned that
the calves are not getting enough
rest. If this much movement con-
tinues to occur, perhaps one day
there won’t be any whales in
Maui.”

The Ferraris’ concern that the
whales are being forced out of their
breeding area is shared by Gates,
the National Marine Fisheries Ser-
vice program chief in Hawaii, who
termed the discovery“disturbing.”

The decline in the number of
whales close to shore is tied to the
beginning of parasail operations—
high-speed boats that tow tourists
dangling from parachutes—and
jet-ski rentals after 1980, the Fer-
raris said. A recent University of
Hawaii study suggests that hump-
backs are affected by the noise of
boats as far as 1,000 yards away.

“The high-speed, constant noise '.
is like having a chain saw in your
bedroom," Ferrari said.

The Ferraris also are concerned

by the scores of whale-watching
boats and private vessels that sail
out each day to view the popular
mammals and the dozens of vessels

bor in what was once prime hump-
back habitat. They also point to the

dying the waters near Maui. At the

Occasionally, their shells fall short

The National Marine Fisheries
Service has responsibility for pro-

tecting the humpback in American
waters. While it has secured the
cooperation of other federal agen-
cies in protecting the humpback, it
has not. yet drafted a recovery plan
for the whales. ‘

conceded Jim Lecky, a spokesman
for the Fisheries Service’s head-
quarters in Los Angeles. “We are
doing everything we can do to
protect the humpback whale in
Hawaii,” he said.

For now, the agency’s main role

is attempting to prevent harass-
ment of the whales by enforcing a
rule requiring boats to stay at least
100 yards from the animals. How-
ever, only one agent is assigned to
enforce the rule, and he often has
other duties. ‘

Gates acknowledged that the
government could be doing more
for the humpback, particularly by
sponsoringmore research. But he
said the Fisheries Service is con-
scious of a growing public concern
for the plight of the humpbacks.

“Humphrey taughtus a lesson:
don’t take whales lightly,” he said.

D IT Still Packs Punch 25 Years Later

Pesticide Dumped at Sea Blamed in Island Birds’ Disappearance

By LARRY B. STAMMER, Times Staff Writer

PACIFIC GROVE—Twenty-
five years after 350 to 700 tons of
DDT were dumped into the ocean
about 15 miles off Los Angeles, the
pesticide’s devastating impact is
still being felt and may persist for
decades.

Results of a new study of sedi-
ments found in two abandoned
ocean dumps 10 miles from Santa
Catalina Island show that DDT is
not only still present in high con-
centrations, but that its presence is
probably responsible for the disap-
pearance of the bald eagle and
peregrine falcon in the area.

“We can only conclude now that
it was this dumping that wiped out
these species throughout the Chan-
nel Islands," said ecologist Robert
W. Risebrough of the Center for
Marine Studies at the University of
California at Santa Cruz.

' These first findings of the study,
commissioned by the Los Angeles
Regional Water Quality Control
Board, were disclosed . here
Wednesday at the sixth annual
International Ocean Disposal Sym-
posium.

Risebrough also said an analysis
of chemical “fingerprints” has led
him to conclude that the DDT in
question was dumped by the Mon-
trose Chemical Co., which manu-
factured DDT in Torrance.

State records indicated that the
firm” dumped DDT in the ocean

from 1947 to the early 19603.
Attempts Wednesday to reach the
company for comment were unsuc-
cessful.

“For a number of years, we
thought this problem was over. But
over the past several years, some
unexpectedly high levels of DDT

compounds began to show up in
Los Angeles area [fish] and we
began to wonder if perhaps the
environmental levels of these com-
pounds were not declining as fast
as we might have expected,” Rise-
brough said.

After it became widely known a
year ago that bottom fish, including
the white croaker, had high levels
of DDT, the state Department of
Health Services posted warnings

against eating the fish. The warn~ ,

ings are still in effect.
“The whole system has been

contaminated. There are still some '

high levels in dolphins’ blubber and
some of the seals,” Risebrough
said. ‘

DDT concentrations just a year
ago in dolphins found in Santa
Monica Bay have been as high as
2,500 parts per million (ppm),

 

olves on the comeback trail in the Rockies

compared to the federal Food and
Drug Administration’s maximum
recommended level for eating fish
of 5 ppm.

Last year, the water quality
board commissioned a series .. of
studies of ocean contamination off
Southern California, including the
two former dump sites. -

“We didn’t know whether we
would be able to see any continuing
effect from the dumping. Now I
think we have," Risebrough said.

The study is still continuing.
However, the early results indicate
that significant levels of DDT are
persisting on the 2,900-foot deep
ocean floor 25 years after the
dumping was halted. From there,
the chemical, originally in barrels,
was gradually cycled through the
food chain.

DENVER [UPl]—-A native
opulation of wolves is making a
omeback in the Rocky Moun-
ains, with at least one pack firmly
stablished in Glacier National
ark on the Montana—Canada bor-
er, a wolf researcher said.

The pack, most of them the des-
endants of a lone wolf that
rossed the border in 1979, now
umbers 15 to 20 and could possi—
ly double this year, said Dr. Rob-
rt Ream, a University of Mon-
ana researcher who’s been

working on a wolf recovery pro-
gram for 12 years.

There hasn’t been a population
of wolves in the. western United
States in at least 50 years, Ream
said, although an estimated 1,200
to 1,500 exist in northern Minne-
sota. There have been scattered re-
ports of one or two wolves being
seen sporadically in the Rocky
Mountains as far south as‘ Yellow-
stone National Park.

Ream said. in an interview heis
quite optimistic that the Glacrer

wolves, which might have split
into two packs, have firmly estab—
lished a viable population in that
park. -

“1 think they’re over the hump
now,” he said. “The pack of 12
we’ve been following has been
down in the park all winter. 1 pre-
dict this spring we’ll have two or
three litters and they’ll be in-
creasing fairly rapidly now.”

The Glacier wolves are primarily
descendants of a female wolf given

the Indian name Kishnena, which

 

 

 

 

.a litter of seven pups in the spring

wandered down into the park in1
1979. She was joined by a male '
wolf two years later, and they had

of 1982.

 

The pack had a second litter of
six or seven pups in 1984 and an- ’
other of seven pups in 1985. 7;:
Ream said there is evidence the
pack might have split this winter
into two or three packs, a signiﬁ—
cant occurrence because only the -~
dominant male and female in .a
single pack breed.

 

The wolf population is on the. in-
crease in the Rocky Mountains.

Dairy branding program
stirs up red-hot protests

[want to say loud and clear: I do
not approve of branding an “X”
three inches wide and a half-inch
deep on the faces of dairy cows.

I think US Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng and livestock specialist
Susan Schneider are inhuman and
should be branded on their faces so
we can tell from a distance that
they’re working for the US Agricul-
ture Department. The branding is
necessary to ensure that these two
people do not land in some other US
department.

This may sound facetious, but I am
dead serious. Lyng’s branding deci-
sion is irresponsible and inhumane.
Both these individuals are totally
unfeeling.

Well, now I’ve heard everything!
Donald Schuessler, whose dairy cows
are part of the dairy herd buy-out
program, claims “branding is not
that bad.” His cows had crosses
burned into their faces and “didn’t
mind”!

The cow I saw being branded on
television certainly did! A huge cloud
of smoke went up as the iron seared
her skin, her mouth opened, her
tongue hung out and she could be
heard bellowing in pain.

It seems to me that if you take a
red-hot piece of iron and press it into

flesh (cow or otherwise) it will cause
pain.

The Department of Agriculture.

can claim all it wants that branding
is “necessary” and “painless,” but I
will not be swayed by government
rhetoric. I will use something much
more reliable -—— common sense --
and continue to insist that facial
branding is cruel and unnecessary.
The farmers I have talked with have
said the same thing and have told me
there are less traumatic alternatives.

Those of us who protest this regu-
lation know something Secretary of
Agriculture Richard Lyng obviously
doesn’t: A burn is a very painful inju-
ry -— both to people, who can say
“Ouch!" and to cows, who cannot.

This is in regard to the branding of

and women —— no matter what their
field of work -- can induce pain
without any feeling, then go back to
their homes and face their children

pain in about a month or longer.”
Perhaps these people should visit a

Vital to Ecosystem

Many Still
in the Dark
About Bats +

By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY,
Times Staff Writer

BRACKEN, Tex—As dusk set-
tled, the first of the bats made their
move.

They darted at the entrance of
the darkened cave, whipping back
and forth, translucent membrane
wings flapping furiously in the
stiffening Texas breeze.

Then, as if answering a signal, an
ocean of bats, millions of bats, the
biggest single bat colony in the
world, began to burst through the
yawning crack in the earth. They
swirled in the natural bowl at the
entrance of the cave, gathering
themselves into tight groups before
moving off for their night’s
work—the gobbling up of 250,000
pounds of insects. ’

As they swept away, others
replaced them, repeating the ritual.
It would take hours for the bats—
about 20 million of them—to leave

to Vordenbaum s chagrin, a goon
portion of the guano finds its way to
Northern California, where it is the
fertilizer of choice for marijuana
growers.

Not Aggressive

Darkness was almost complete
when Tuttle climbed up the side of
the bowl and emerged from the bat
swirl holding his catch. By the
beam of a flashlight, he put his
finger to the bat’s mouth to show
that it is not aggressive by nature.
Then he talked about how bats are
much maligned, mostly because
they can transmit rabies. But, he
said in their defense, only 10 people
have contracted rabies from bat
bites in the last 40 years; lawn
mower accidents kill more people
than that each year.

“They really are one of the
gentlest animals around,” said
Tuttle, without batting an eye.
Vordenbaum agreed, saying that
none of the men who work for him
had ever been hurt in the decades
of mining guano in the cave, in
rocky cattle country just outside

their roost and dart off into the
night.

One-Handed Catch

So what did Merlin Tuttle do,
when faced with this bat swarm?
He walked right in among them,
into the bowl of bats. He flailed his
arms around and snagged himself a
bat with a one-handed catch.

And what did Paul Vordenbaum
do? He pulled out a hip ﬂask and
poured himself a nip of bourbon.

“Watch out for snakes,” he
warned Tuttle.

Perhaps this scene calls for an
explanation. Tuttle is the ultimate
batman, the leading defender of the
bat cause, a scientist who has spent
25 years studying bats throughout
the world. He even has two pet

bats, Zuri and Rafiki (Swahili for
“beautiful” and “friend” ).

Vordenbaum, who watches over ’
the bat cave owned by his cousin,
Elgin Marbach, has spent enough
time around the nocturnal crea-
tures to realize that a rattlesnake is
more menacing. The bats are also a
source of income, for Vordenbaum
and the Marbachs mine the bat
guano in the winter, when their
cave dwellers have moved south,

and they sell it as fertilizer. Much

by vampire bats. And, Tuttle said,
more than 8,000 caves had been
destroyed in Brazil for the same
reason, further endangering a
number of other species.

Distant Relations

“The people who don’t know that
much about bats think they’re all
vampires,” Tuttle said. “I can show
you bats that are more distantly
related than a sea otter is to a
tiger."

Despite such bad news on the bat
front, Tuttle also points to success-
es since his organization was
founded in 1982. He said six of the
largest bat populations in North
America are now protected by
federal agencies and conservation
groups because of his efforts, and
that governments in other parts of
the world are now examining bats
in a more favorable light. Tuttle
said, however, that the bat cause is
still in its infancy.

“The bats have just been neg-
lected, unless they have caused a
problem,” he said.

Tuttle thinks, by the way, that
every backyard should have a bat
house, and will even send out plans
on how to make one. What’s good
enough for birds, he believes, ought
to be good enough for bats.

 




San Antonio.

That, however, is not the com-
mon image of bats, which make up
about a quarter ‘ of the world’s
mammal species. '

They are seen as vile, ugly, rabid
and downright scary. They are
associated with Dracula, Hallow-
een, moonless nights, haunted
houses and evil in general, and they
have been for a long time. Consider
the ingredients in the brew con-
cocted by the witches in Shake-
speare’s “Macbeth”: “Eye of newt
and toe of frog, wool of bat and
tongue of dog.” ,

One of the few places in the
world where bats are held in high
esteem is China, where they are

rather than scientific, and has been
stalked by curious jaguars and
tigers.

“The biggest risk of studying
bats is not the bats, but being out at
night," he said.

Tuttle thinks bats are beautiful.
He also thinks that people fear bats

because they don’t know anything
about them.

Bat fear, he believes, can be
overcome with bat facts, and these
are a few of his offerings:

—The bats from the cave in
Bracken alone eat a quarter of a
million pounds of insects each
night, most of them mosquitoes.
“The bats will leave you alone; the
mosquitoes won’t,” he says.

 

In Southeast Asia, the bats are endangered for
another reason—they are a gourmet delicacy.

 

 

considered a good luck charm. The
Chinese word for bat is fu, which
also means happiness.

“Bats do need better press," said
Gary McCracken, a University of
Tennessee bat expert, one of the
few in the United States. McCrack-
en estimates that if the nation’s bat
experts all came together for a
meeting, it would amoa5.? to a
good-sized cocktail party.

The point man for educating the
public about bats is Tuttle, the
founder and president of a group
known as Bat Conservation Inter—
national. A friendly, studious-look-
ing man, Tuttle, 44, founded his
organization because the bat popu-
lation of the world is rapidly being
destroyed. And that, he said, would
be catastrophic to the earth’s eco-
system, which depends on bats for

everything from reforestation to

insect control.

In this part of the world, they are
being dynamited and their caves
are being sealed. up. They are being
poisoned by fruit farmers and by
people who simply do not want
them in their attics. In Southeast
Asia, the bats are endangered for
another reason—they are a gour—
met delicacy. -

Ignorance Cited

In one case, an Arizona cave
housed 30 million bats in the 19605.
Now, there are only 30,000. Such
numbers alarm Tuttle, who began
his conservation group in
Wisconsin, but moved to Texas this
year because it is a better place to
study bats—“bat nirvana,” he calls
it. He has walked through cobra-
infested jungles of Thailand at
night to bat-watch, had his camp
strafed by Peruvians who thought
his night activity was larcenous

—There are almost 1,000 variet-
ies of bats and they live in every
part of the world except uninhabit-
able deserts and the polar regions.
In the tropical areas of the world,
they are needed for seeding and
pollinating rain forests. They also
pollinate and disperse-seeds in the
wild for bananas, plantains, avoca-

“*

dos, mangoes, dates, figs, cashews
and the agave plant, from which
tequila is made.

—As for the bat guano, it is used
for other things besides growing
marijuana. In the Malaysian state of
Sarawak, for example, it is used to
fertilize crops that produce almost
a third of the world’s supply of
black and white pepper.

Shy Creatures

All this, Tuttle says, and bats still
get a bad rap.

“It’s only natural that people fear
most what they understand least,”
Tuttle said. “Bats have the misfor-
tune of being shy and only active at
night, so people come to fear
them.”

Tuttle said he tried for years to
enlist the aid of major conservation
groups to help protect bats, but
never received any help. So he
founded Bat Conservation Interna-
tional, which now has an unimpos-
ing 900 members in 25 countries.
One of the organization’s biggest
supporters is Bacardi rum, which
has a bat as a trademark, a throw—
back to the days when the compa-
ny wanted a distinctive symbol
that illiterate imbibers would rec—
ognize even if they could not read
the label.

The president of Bacardi, Bill
Walker, said he read a newspaper
article two years ago about Tuttle’s
group during a time when he was

searching for a meaningful conser-
vation effort. Bats were a natural
because of the Bacardi trademark.

“It suddenly clicked,” he said.
“The interest in conservation be-
came more specific.”

Since then, Bacardi has printed 1
million pro-bat brochures, which
the company gives away.

“We get a surprising amount of
mail,” Walker said. “I didn’t realize
so many peOple were interested in

, bats.”

Madison Avenue, though, would
have trouble selling bats. They do,
after all, carry rabies. And certain

species of bats are vampires that

live by extracting blood from ani-
mals and humans.
Tuttle takes on the first problem

. by explaining that only sick bats,

incapacitated by their own disease,
are the ones who bite when they
come into direct contact with pets
or people. Healthy bats, he said,
have about as much interest in
being around people as people do

., about being around bats. So if you
do not touch them, and pets are
vaccinated, the chance of contract-
ing rabies is almost nonexistent.

“If you want to find a rabid bat,
you can find one almost any day of
the summer,” Tuttle said. But if
you leave them alone, “the odds of
being harmed are about the same
as being run over by a Mack truck
carrying a load of cement while you
are at home sleeping at 3 in the
morning.”

Others More Dangerous

Dr. Denny Constantine, a Cali—
fornia public health veterinarian
and one of the world’s leading
experts on rabies, said there was
more danger of the disease from
other animals.

“In surveys, we’ve found that
one out of 200 bats was incubating
rabies,” he said. “If you go out and
collect skunks and foxes, you may
find a much higher proportion.”

And, “if you have a colony of
bats in your house and one bat has
rabies, it’s not likely the other ones
are going to get it.”

As for the question of vampire
bats, Tuttle dismisses that by say-
ing that there are only three
known species and they all live in
Central and South America. But
human fear of them has decimated
the bat population in Mexico.

McCracken, the University of
Tennessee expert, said he traveled
to Mexico early this year to study
the wintering habits of the Mexican
free—tail bat, the same species that
inhabits the Bracken cave in the
warmer months. He had with him a
long list of roosting sites, but
almost half the caves had been
dynamited or burned out by people
who feared they might be inhabited

By Jean Caldwell
Special to the Globe

PLAINFIELD - “They are just gorgeous animals.
much more interesting and attractive than cattle,"
says Sylvane Stockwell.

Armed with that opinion, a dream to change
their lifestyle, a savings they won’t divulge and a
computer printout on the pros and cons of buffalos,
Sylvane and Bruce Stockwell became members of
an elite breed of ranchers: On their 105-acre spread
here in the Berkshire hills, they are raising 34 buf—
falo.

And they expect to turn a profit.

Lazing in the early spring sunshine, the buffalo
on the Triple A ranch look as gentle as cows. But
Bruce Stockwell insists a buffalo is a wild animal.

“Many raisers of buffalo have been buried by
them. gored to death.” he warned. “They are self-
protective if they perceive danger. They form a half—
circle with the young inside. A bear came over once
and they ran the bear out.”

Ever since two bulls charged him. Stockwell has
carried a gun when he‘s with the animals. “Occa—
sionally they have a day when they don't want to be
bothered. I don't go into the field then.” .

Size is the animal’s biggest asset. A full grown
bull stands six feet tall and weighs two tons. When
they are upset, Stockwell explained. “T hey raise
their tail, paw the ground. snort and give a throaty
grunt.” .

The Stockwells turned to buffalo ranching to es-
cape the corporate merry—go~round in California.
They had no experience in ranching and would be

raising black angus beef cattle today if Sylvane had
not visited Canada and fallen in love with buffalo.
“They are more efficient in turning feed into

a lower quality diet feed. they have relatively little
calving problems. They are impervious to most cat-
tle disease. They have a much healthier meat, lower
in fat and cholesterol. higher in protein.”

The Stockwells say buffalo meat rivals beef in
flavor. Local residents, tourists and the nearby Buf-
falo Village Restaurant snapped up the meat from
the four buffalo the Stockwells have butchered.

Although as many as 120 million buffalo once
roamed the western plains, the beasts came close to
extinction by 1900. Today the American Buffalo As-
sociation in Denver estimates there are between
80,000 and 100,000 buffalo in the United States and
Canada. with 10,000 slaughtered for meat annual-
ly.

The Stockwells purchased their stock as babies
from a Canadian producer at $700 a head; they
think it may take seven years before they turn a
profit.

Dr. Thomas Cranston, Ashfield veterinarian
who cares for the herd, is skeptical that raising buf-
falo can ever make money in western Massachu-
setts because of high land costs. He fears that, with-
out more room to roam. the buffalo ”will run into
social problems . . . mutilating each other."

Anthony Borton, an animal science expert at the
University of Massachusetts-Amherst. doubts
there’s a profitable market until there is a demand
for buffalo meat.

Massachusetts Department of Agriculture spe-
cialists were hard pressed to predict whether buffalo
ranching will be profitable in the Berkshire Hills,
although the department is all for diversification.

But Sylvane Stockwell is undeterred by such
skepticism. She dreams of a herd of 3,000.

  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

  

     

 




LOS ANGELES TIMES - April 25, 1986

71 Seized in Southland
Animal Rights Protests

By JERRY BELCHER, Times Staff Writer

Concentrating their efforts in
Southern California, nearly 800
animal rights advocates established
peaceful blockades of university
research centers and laboratories
across the nation Thursday, de-
manding an end to experiments on
animals that they claim are “cruel,
ridiculous and unnecessary.”

At least 162 people—few if any of
them students—were arrested, in-
cluding 48 at UCLA, 8 at USC, 10 at
UC Irvine and 5 at UC San Diego.

There were no reports of vio-
lence or resistance, although dem-

onstrators chained themselves to
laboratory doors at UC Irvine and
the University of Minnesota in
Minneapolis.

The arrests came just one day
after 25 anti-apartheid protesters
were arrested and scuffling broke
out at UCLA when they occupied
an administration building.

Thursday’s demonstrations were
organized by the April 24th Coali-
tion, which spokeswoman Margo
Tannenbaum said represents 33
animal rights groups with com-

bined memberships of 1 million.
Tannenbaum, a long-time animal
rights advocate from San Bernar-
dino, took part in, but was not
arrested at, the UCLA demonstra-
tion.

“I would consider today very
successful for the first national
attempt. . . . This was the first
time almost all animal rights
groups have joined form'- a de—
mand access to the labora was and
evaluate whether their treatment
is humane,” she said.

“All of it [animal experimenta-
tion] is unnecessary . . . bad sci-
ence,” she said. “There are many
viable alternatives that will bring
better results at less expense . . .
cell cultures, computer models,
work on human cells.”

But Albert Barber, vice chancel-
lor for research at UCLA, said the
turnout of demonstrators was not
large considering the effort the
animal rights groups had put into it.
And, he said, “We ,do not do
research on animals that result in a
lot of pain.”

“Although I have some sympa-
thy for their concerns,” Barber
said, the demand that all animal
research be halted “is non-
sense. . . . We cannot deliver our
mission of medical research unless
animals are used for certain kinds
of work. There just is no other
way.”

‘Rather Die From My Cancer’

At UC Irvine, Joy Yonkman, 32, a
nurse from Long Beach, said: “If I
got cancer, I would not want my
cure to come this way [through
experiments on animals]. I’d rather
die from my cancer.”

Robert C. Benedict, USC’s assist-
ant vice president for health af-
fairs, called the laboratories on his
campus models of humane treat-
ment of animals, but he noted that
there are some kinds of research
that cannot be done except by

H

 

using animals. The use of animals
has dropped substantially in the
last five years, he said, but “for the
rest of the century, animal models
will have to be used. . . . Ninety
per cent are from the rodent fami-
y.”
He said the demonstration at
USC “was very peaceful except
that it also was thoughtless. . . .It
was right near the Kenneth Norris
Jr. Cancer Hospital, where there
are some very sick patients. I told
them that. That’s Why they were
arrested for disturbing the peace in
a hospital zone.”

Charles Kuell, a clinical psychol-
ogist, said at USC that if the
universities will permit “our people
[to go] in, our medical personnel,
credentialed people who will act
properly, that will eliminate the
need for the Animal Liberation
Front.” The underground Animal
Liberation Front has raided and
vandalized a number of research
facilities across the nation.

Since the universities will not
permit open inspection of facilities,
Kuell said, he condones the Animal
Liberation Front’s tactics. “I can
understand the terrible frustration
year after year of trying to deal
With these people [researchers]
and meeting a blank wall.”

“It was all passive, nonviolent
civil disobedience,” Tannenbaum
said. “There was total cooperation
With the police.”

Whale washes up on Wfollaston Beach;
biologists checking for cause of death

By Diane E. Lewis
Globe Staff

No one knows exactly what caused the death of
a slate-gray, 2.000-pound minke whale discovered
on Wollaston Beach early yesterday.

Greg Early, a biologist for the New England
Aquarium. surmised that a fisherman‘s net filled
with a fresh catch could have lured the 15-foot
mammal into Boston Harbor. where it probably
became tangled in the net and sank days before
its inflated carcass floated back up and was
Washed to shore.

”This is a solitary whale." Early said yesterday
as he cut up pieces of the dead animal on the
beach. “You usually don’t see herds of these guys.
But many times they come in close to feed and
sometimes they feed out of fishing nets."

He said he and his colleagues plan to study por-
tions of the whale to determine the cause of death.

About 100 curious adults and children. some of
them area residents who had heard about the
whale on a local radio station. watched Early and
aquarium biologist Jeffrey Boggs measure and dis-
sect the whale.

A professor from a nearby college took pictures
of the animal and then collected samples of whale
blubber to show his students.

“In the 10 years I've been here, this is the first
time we've actually had a whale on our doorstep."
said Dr. Philip McLaren. chairman of the biology
department of Eastern Nazarene College. McLaren
is interested in a protein found in the whale's
blubber. He said the protein. called myoglobin, al—
lows whales to store large amounts of oxygen.

Marine biologists spotted the dead whale ﬂoat-
ing in the harbor earlier this week and a team of

specialists and seamen searched the Nut Island
shore but were unable to find the mammal. ac-
cording to Boggs.

Yesterday, the whale lay in a pocket of dirty
sand. It had been dead for about two weeks. the
biologists said. Spectators gasped when Early
picked up two large carving knives. sharpened
one and then pierced. the carcass.

A child standing in the front of the crowd
pointed to the whales missing tail. Early said that
someone had sliced off the tail, presumably for use
as a trophy. '

“I'm not sure why people like to do that in this
day and age." he said. “I guess somebody got here
first and decided they wanted to put the tail up on
their wall."

Early described the minke whale as a “com-
mon. local resident" of Massachusetts waters and
said it is not threatened with extinction like the
humpback, bowhead. finback and right whales.
which are larger and are considered prime fishing
targets.

“Minke whales being very small haven’t at—
tracted a lot of attention.” said Early. ”Theyjust
haven't been as exploited as other whales."

An adult minke whale is not much larger than
a baby blue whale. which can reach 100 feet in
adulthood. The minke is a baleen. and can grow to
about 25 feet in adulthood. Such whales have no
teeth. They use plates that allow them to trap
small fish.

Massachusetts District Commission workers
used a front-end loader yesterday to remove the
dead whale from the beach shortly after 11 am. —
about four hours after it was reported to authori-
ties. Workers said the whale would be taken to a
landﬁn.

Ellie is opinionated
about dog behavior; she’s a
mother and has had to raise
some unruly sons. That’s
why she ended up refusing
to allow Bobbe Morris, her
owner, to let Morris’ house
guest, 2-year-old Fallon,
play with a new toy dog.
Fallon had just been given
one of those toy dogs that
bark and run around when
you clap your hands, and
then stop barking and
stand still when you clap
again. To the Morris family
members and their friends,
the dog was a delightful
toy, but to Ellie it was just
more nuisance barking.
Since Bobbe Morris is a vol-
unteer animal control offi-
cer, Ellie goes “Oops!”
when she hears nuisance
barking, because she
knows that dogs who are
ignorant enough to do nui-
sance barking can end up
in the pound. She learned
to turn the toy dog off by
barking at it.

LAIGE COUNTRY LIVING — Pewaukee, Wisconsin — Anril 3. 1986

Ducks regain control of life in

by Jim Stevens
Staff writer

rafalger Square has its pigeons,
Capistrano has its swallows, and
Pewaukee has its ducks. While the

ducks of Pewaukee are not as

famous as their feathered friends of
California and Capistrano, they are
famous, or at least thetalk of the town, in
Pewaukee, especially at this time of year.
Spring is the time for young love, and

Cupid’s arrow annually pierces the hearts .

of Pewaukee’s fowl residents. As anyone
who lives near the Pewaukee River will
attest, these ducks quack out their love
songs extremely early in the morning.

Spring is also the time the ducks leave
the river and lake and, taking their lives
into their wings, waddle across the busiest
streets in Pewaukee in search of food and
nesting sites.

“The problem areas are East
Wisconsin, Clark Street, Oakton Avenue,
Sentry and the village hall,” said Louis
’l‘hibault, superintendent of the village’s
department of public works.

During this time, drivers in these areas
have to be wary as the hens, which are now
in heat, are being chased by love-starved
males. Flying careless“: 3; into traffic, many
ducks have met their maker by meeting
head-on with the grille of a Buick.

”It is a problem out there,” Thibault
said. “We pick up quite a few of them. They
are basically a traffic hazard."

Thibault said the ducks “are a nuisance
by the village hall,“ leaving their
droppings throughout the parking lot.

Although the little quackers can be
bothersome, the village will help its
feathered residents in time of need.

“Last year we had a call about
ducklings in an inlet (for a storm sewer)
Thibault said. “We sent out a couple of guys
and they took them out one at a time.”

The ducks of Pewaukee have a streak of
obstinacy and daring as they walk at will
across streets. At times, they stubbornly
will not move, staring down backed-up
traffic.

Some ducks decide to warm themselves
in the early morning sun on the roads,
sitting on the blacktop paying no mind to
oncoming traffic.

’During spring and through part of
summer, the ducks wander through yards,
and tormenting tied-up dogs, the ducks just
waddle on by.

But perhaps the Sentry store parking
lot, 121 Oakton Ave., is the best place to
view duck antics. Walking and sitting
where they please, they display an air of
independence or just plain foolishness.
Some ducks have been known to follow
patrons out of the store, quacking for bread
crumbs.

In some ways, the ducks are their own
traffic cops.

Pewaukee Police Chief Edward
Baumann said the ducks “do run the traffic
pattern in Pewaukee. They’re not too bad,”
he said. “We have yet to receive one
complaint. I think people do enjoy seeing

 

their feathered friends."

One East Wisconsin resident has
enjoyed having the ducks visit her for
several years.

Lila Conrad, 330 E. Wisconsin Ave., had
been coming to Pewaukee for several years
and finally moved into the village in 1959.
Conrad has fed the ducks that come into her
yard and nervously watches them cross the
busy street. - 7

“I almost have a nervous breakdown
when they’re crossing the road,” she said.
“Last year, I had one that faced the road all
day looking for an opening to take her brood
of ducklings. She waited until it was safe."

Conrad, who used to raised white ducks
on a farm, said she gets involved with her
web-footed visitors. “To me they‘re people.
I enjoy having them around," she said.

And the ducks are around. From the

lakefront to Pfeffer Park. The number of
ducks in the village has increased
dramatically over the past few years.

“We got ducks. Boy, do we have ducks,”
said Leo Heinzelman, 117 Oakton Ave.

Heinzelman said he started feeding the
ducks four years ago and takes some of the
responsibility for the duck population
growth.

Heinzelman said he leaves about a half
bushel of corn out for the ducks during the
winter. And the ducks have become
accustomed to this daily handout. What
Heinzelman sees when he goes outside on a
winter morning would fulfill the wildest
fantasy of any duck hunter - 350 to 400
ducks in the river that lies between Sentry
and Pewaukee Lawn and Garden. About 99
pergent of those ducks are mallards, he
sat .

Heinzelman credits Jack Straehler,

another loveriof ducks,who keeps the back
area behind Pewaukee Lawn and Garden
plowed so Heinzelman and other duck
lovers can feed them.

“There are a lot of people doing this,”
Heinzelman said. “And there are too many
ducks now. We only need 10. Right now
they're running around town getting
killed.” '

Despite some of the problems the ducks
present, Heinzelman said he does have a
soft spot for them, especially the young
ones. “There‘s nothing cuter, along with a
puppy or kitten, than a baby duck, " he said,
smiling. “People get a big kick out of them.
I do, too, up to a point."

While Heinzelman feeds the ducks in the
morning during the winter, Lucille Hunt of

N40 W2770 Highway J feeds them in the
afternoon.

“I’bought over a ton of corn shell last
year, ’ she said. For the past two years
Hunt also has been feeding the ducks in the
area behind Savoy Court.

. “I just love them,” she said. During the
winter the ducks got to know her car and at
times the ducks would surround her car
before she could even get out, she said.

Hunt says she has seen people feeding
the ducks near Sentry every Saturday.

Pewaukee

However, one time she saw one of the few
instances of cruelty to the ducks.

“Last year I was coming to Sentry,
when I saw a handsome young man, about
15, throwing rocks at them,” she said.
Other children on the other side of the river
told him to stop. But he killed one, and as it

was floating down the river he had a

satisfied look on his face. The police were
contacted, but I don’t know whatever
happened. The little kids were so upset.

“Some (people) are a little sadistic, but
most are very kind to them. That’s the only
time I ever saw any cruelty."

Though the duck population is growing,
there is not any movement to get the ducks
out.

“That's one of the duck flocks I haven’t
heard much about," said Mark Anderson,
wildlife agent for the Department of
Natural Resources. “I haven‘t received
many calls about them.”

Anderson said during the spring the
flock in the village is at its peak, which be
estimated at about 400. Anderson said if the
ducks do become a problem, peOple should

' just stop feeding them.

“There is a town down in Racine County
that passed an ordinance that says if you
feed ducks you have a pay a small fine, " he
said. _

Anderson said the Pewaukee River
cannot itself support the number of ducks

; on it. Besides the handouts, the ducks feed
. on the, lake, fly out to open fields or find

spilled or waste grain along the railroad

1 tracks.

Such talk about a ”don‘t feed the ducks“

' ordinance might be considered heresy in

Pewaukee.

“The ducks don’t bother me," said
Lester Teuteberg, 404 Oakton Ave.
Teuteberg and his wife, Ethel, provide
water and feed for the ducks.

“1 look forward to the ducks,” she said.

The annual takeover of Pewaukee
streets has begun and new arrivals will
soon be on the way. And as far as
Pewaukeeans are concerned, well,
everything is just ducky with them and
their feathered friends.

the center of the park. Water vapor pouring from its
nostrils like steam, the 2,000-pound animal struggled
in vain to climb out of the river.

About mid-morning, Barbara Seaquist, a park
service employee, discovered the drowning bison and
contacted park headquarters. She was told that the
episode was a natural occurrence and that the
animal should be allowed to sink or swim on its own.
In the meantime, several people had heard about the
struggling animal and appeared on the scene to
photograph it. Around 5 p.m., as dusk was setting on
the buffalo's life-or-death struggle, a party of nine
snowmobilers approached the bridge. After learning
that rescuing the bison was against park policy, one
of the snowmobilers, Glenn Nielson, president of
Nielson Enterprises Inc., an oil and gas exploration
and real estate company in Cody, Wyo., became
outraged. He was struck, he says, by the callous
attitude of those photographing the scene. “If you‘re
not going to help it,” Nielson recalls saying, “then
why don’t you put it out of its misery?"

The snowmobilers left the scene, and after a brief
caucus, four of them returned, Nielson carrying a 60-
foot orange nylon rope. Seaquist was gone when they
returned, so they fashioned a loop, tossed it over the
animal’s horns and walked gingerly out onto the ice,
where they tried to haul the animal to safety.

Meanwhile, Seaquist returned to the bridge and
repeated her request that nature be allowed to run its
course. She also warned the four men that they were
endangering their own lives by walking out onto the
ice. They ignored her. Continuing their rescue at-
tempt, they at one point, according to Nielson, almost
had the animal out of the water when the rope broke.

“The sad thing,” Nielson says, “is that he [the
bison] knew we were trying to help. He laid his head
at my feet, just exhausted.” As it grew too dark for
Nielson and his party to see, the attempt was
abandoned. That night the temperature plummeted
to 20 below zero. In the morning the bison was found
dead, frozen into the ice. Coyotes and ravens soon
descended on the animal. When the warmth of spring
opened the river and freed the remainder of the
carcass, the bison ﬂoated downstream, a shred of
orange rope still attached to its horns.

Nielson, angered by the incident, wrote a letter to
radio commentator Paul Harvey, describing what he
believes was an act of cruelty by the park service.
Harvey seized on the incident, and in three venom-
filled broadcasts, tore into the park service policy of
non-intervention, calling biologists and naturalists
“knee-jerk ecologists."

Leﬂ: Grizzly bear: A dwindling population.

 

Nielson believes the park service is guilty of
‘iypocrisy. “It’s no secret that they trap bears and
nove them,” he says. “That’s not natural. Why
shouldn’t we have been allowed to save the buffalo?”

“There’s no question that nature is harsh,” then-
Ihief Ranger Thomas Hobbs said just after the
ricident. “But a national park is not a ranch or a zoo.
weak animal is nature’s way of doing business. It’s
he perpetuation of all life cycles; when an animal
’ies. there are others that survive because of it."

The park service acknowledges that there are
nconsistencies and contradictions in natural man-
;gement; however, officials say, more manipulative
echniques have failed miserably. In fact, a number
if parks are living with mistakes wrought by well-
rneaning but misguided park managers.

ellowstone’s wolf population, for ex-
ample, considered undesirable be-
cause the animals killed elk and
other ungulates, was exterminated
in the park in the early part of the
century. later, officials realized that
the animals are an important part of
atural regulation because they kill sick or weakened
.nimals, thereby keeping herds healthy. Now some
ark service officials are hoping to reintroduce the
OH to Yellowstone.
Despite natural management, man’s rearranging
f nature continues. Grizzlies, when they conﬂict with
umans in the parks, are still trapped and moved,
ften to Canada, or sometimes shot. The effect of this
ray mean nothing less than a restructuring of the
ene pool. Cliff Martinka, Glacier National Park’s...
ipervisory biologist, believes that by culling bears.‘
rat show aggressive tendencies, the park service
my be weeding out bears with a perfectly natural
lI'lOUS trait and breeding a shy population.
While the interaction of people and wildlife poses
icky questions about what is natural and unnatural,
.vmetimes the conflict between different kinds of
lelife can have a serious effect on nature’s equili-
ium. The wolf had been exterminated in Montana
’ the 19305. Now, half a century later, a pack of
olves has wandered in from Canada and appears to
setting up shop in Montana again. Though biolo-
sts are enthused by the return of an important part
the ecosystem, they fear the wolf may wipe out
nail and fragile populations of bighorn sheep in the
«.rk, a natural thing for the wolf to do. “We have a
~rilosophical problem," says Martinka about the
volf’s return to Glacier. “The question is, do you
am a naturally occurring predator to be preying on
species to the extent it causes it to become
\ﬁnct?”
However, the park service’s real natural manage-
.ent headache has been over the management of the

 

rizzly bear in Yellowstone. The primary thrust of

 

 

 

 

management has been to keep the bear wild and
away from humans. Critics charge that the natural
bearemanagement policy is instead a policy of local
extinction. Over the past several decades the number
of grizzlies in Yellowstone has dwindled to roughly
200 to 250 bears, including perhaps as few as 4010 50
breeding females. And the bears are dying faster
than they are being replawd. “With the mortality
rates we're getn'ng,” says Dick Knight, head of the
federal lnteragency Grizzly Bear Team, in Bozeman,
Mont, “we’re looking at the end of the grizzly bear
population in 20 to 30 years. Something drastic nwds
to be done.” The park service and the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service place the blame for the decline of the
bear on illegal killing around the park and the
pressure of mining, oil and gas development and
logging in critical grizzly habitats—problems outside
the park boundaries that the park service is power-
less to do anything about.

But within the park, officials have made valiant
attempts to protect the bear. They've closed critical
grizzly habitats to human use, worked with neighbors
to clean up dumps and sent employees into the field
to teach visitors about etiquette in grizzly country.

Several vocal critics, hgwever, believe the park
service’s efforts are misdirected. The real reason the
grizzly teeters on the precipice of extinction in
Yellowstone, they say, is the park's refusal to con-
sider anything but a natural course for the big bear.

“The Yellowstone ecosystem, which includes the
park, cannot be returned to pre-Columbian condi-
tions, and failure to recognize this has stymied a
practical [bear] management program,” says grizzly
bear biologist John Craighead. “In a park with a
visitation of 2 million people annually, management
must be designed to help man and bear coexist—even
if it means compromising an idealistic but unrealistic
back-to-primal nature concept.”

The argument over natural management of grizzly
bears began back in 1968, when the park service
decided to close all the garbage dumps in Yellow-
stone and keep people from feeding the bears.
Officials hoped to create a population of grizzly bears
that was dependent on natural foods rather than the
leavings of tourists. Bears had helped make Yellow-
stone famous. Begging and clowning bruins along the
road often created “bear jams" as people stopped to
take snapshots or feed the bears. Bleachers were set
up at dumps to allow people to watch them paw
through mountains of trash. Frank and John
Craighead, twin brothers'wlw, in 1959, were the first
to scientifically study grizzly bears, argued against a
“cold turkey” approach. The bears had been depend-
ent on garbage since the late 18005; instead, they
said, wean the bears slowly off trash.

in the mid-19605 park service officials were adac
mant about their plans to close the dumps. Why
prolong the problem, they argued. Then, in 1967, two

 

 

young women were killed by grizzly bears on the
same night in Glacier National Park—bears, it
turned out, that had been accustomed to feeding on
garbage. It added urgency to the dump closures.
Bears that refused to adapt back to the wild were
trapped and transported elsewhere or simply shot.
For the 5-year period ending in 1975 the park service
reported that it had killed or removed 142 bears from
the Yellowstone ecosystem. By the Craigheads’
count, 189 bears were lost to Yellowstone.

Whatever the case, the Craigheads believe that the
large number of bears shot or shipped away from the
park coupled with removal of the critical food
sources in the dumps, is showing up now in reduced
numbers of grizzly bears. And the Craigheads claim
the park service must realize that human intrusions
into and around the park—buildings, roads, people
themselves—have deprived the bears of a portion of
their food source. There must, they argue, be com-
pensation. A failure to begin feeding the bears
immediately, they say, perhaps with elk carcasses,
means that grizzly bears in Yellowstone may die out.

hough park service officials claim
they will consider feeding the bears,
they make it clear that supplemental
feeding is a long shot. They believe
that the population of grizzly bears
will reach equilibrium based on
available food supplies, and feeding
the bears now would destroy gains made in restoring
a natural population. “Feeding the bears can compli-
cate things worse than they aheady are,” says park
grizzly biologist Gary Brown.

Chris Servheen, head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service’s Grizzly Bear Recovery Team in Missoula,
Mont, backs up Brown. He says that supplemental
feeding would be a herculean task, requiring 5,000 to
6,000 elk per year, roughly a fifth of the total
population. Servheen believes the population de-
crease is part of a normal adjustment still occurring
after the dump closures. “We’re not going to whistle
in the dark and assume everything’s fine,” he says.
“But we’re not at the panic stage.” Supplemental
fwding, he says, will be considered as a last resort.

The natural management of America’s national
parks will probably always evoke controversy, for it
is a philosophy, not a science, and there are no hard
and fast rules for its application. Nature is unpredict-
able, as well as cmel and unforgiving. Even so, to
many people it is sunshine and ﬂowers on a fragrant

Spring day, not a wolf ripping the belly from a white-

tailed doe or disease claiming the lives of a hundred
bighom sheep. But to meddle with the natural
balance by preventing the bad and encouraging the
good, the park service maintains, will only serve to
upset the intricate natural systems of the national
parks. I

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH,

Sun., Apr. 20, 1986 ‘

 

Residents Of. Jefferson County
Stumped By Disappearing Dogs

By Mary E. Chollet
Of the Post- -Dispatch Staff

McGruff, the Crime Dog, would be
outraged.

Someone is snatching the family
dogs of Jeffe1son County. More than
40 dogs have been reported nabbed
from homes and yards in the last two
months, say county officials. Two
more vanished last week.

Officials believe the number of
missing dogs may be even higher
than reported. But so far, not a single
missing dog has been found in the
county pounds or at the Humane
Society.

Officials and animal lovers fear the
purloined pups are winding up in re-
search laboratories.

“That’s a possibility," concedes
Diane Rigley, who works on investi-
gations for the Humane Society in St.
Louis. Rigley says she has been get-
ting “quite a few” calls from people
in Jefferson County searching for
their dogs.

Most of the dogs are black Labra-
dor retrievers, boxers and German
shepherds.

“It’s really strange,” Rigley said.
Jefferson County and a small area in
southwestern Missouri have been the
only areas with widespread reports of
missing pets, she said.

A year ago, about a dozen dogs
were stolen from homes in Jefferson
County and shot through the head.
The dogs were found in a ravine near

House Springs. That case never was
enlvpd

 

“In a rural area,
most people do not
keep their animals
confined. They don’t
haveto,sothey
don’t.”

“In a rural area, most people do
not keep their animals c,onfined”
Rigley said. “They don’t have to, so
they don’ t. There’s no leash laws.”

Rigley said that if the bounds now
being heisted were exotic or show

dogs, she might suspect that they
were being resold. But these missing

‘ dogs are a mystery.

County Sheriff Walter “Buck”
Buerger also is stumped. The
Buergers’ own two pets recently were
victims of the dognappers.

But if the dogs are being sold for

research, it is not likely they are
showing up in local labs, officials and
researchers say.

“There’s no such thing as buying
from individuals” said Glenda Wi-
man, spokeswoman for Washington
University’s School of Medicine.
“People don’t just come up and say,
‘Hey, you want to buy a dog?’ ”

By law, labs can buy research ani-
mals only from pounds or from sup-
pliers licensed by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture.

Washington University has been
buying dogs from Jefferson County
since 1982, Wiman said, but only from
the county pound.

St. Louis University does not use
long- -haired, purebred or large dogs
like Iabradors or German shepherds
in its research, said Dr. Richard
Doyle chairman of the department
of comparative medicine.

The university uses mostly short-
haired “coon hound- type” dogs,
which it buys from a licensed dealer,
Ozark Research Supplier, in Vienna,
Mo., Doyle said. Washington Univer-
sity also sometimes buys from Ozark
Research.

Doyle said that if people were

missing purebred hunting dogs, they

were most likely being sold to other
hunters. Such dogs are sold for sever-
al hundred dollars, he said, whereas
a research animal goes for about $35

Mary Huffstutler of Ozark Re-
search Supplier, said she bought her
dogs for $25 to $30 at dog auctions in
northern Missouri and Kansas. Huff-
stutler said she bought one or two
dogs at a time -— hounds, mostly —
from farmers who can no longer care
for them.

Huffstutler said she had never
bought a large group of dogs from

. one person. And she added, “We don’t
’. buy any kind of a pet dog. We might

buy a black lab, but we would never
buy a pet. ”

But when pressed, she agreed that
she does not know for sure where the
dogs she purchases start out.

OAKLAND TRIBUNE (CA) - April 23, 1986

Biologists capture
2 California con d ors ‘

By Ted Thackrey Jr.
Les Angola: Times

Biologists using cannon-
launched nets captured two
male California condors in as
many days, leaving only three of
the vulture-like birds free in the
wild.

One of the big birds —-— about
10 years old and known to biolo-
gists as AC-6 — was taken to the
Greater Los Angeles Zoo, where
zoo research director Cathleen
Cox said he will be “essential” to
the 200’s Condor Captive Breed-
ing Program.

The other -— about 14 years
old and known as AC-2 -—- was
being kept in a portable cage
while his blood is tested for its
lead content. If it is not unusual-

ly high, National Audubon Socie-~

ty spokesman Jesse Grantham
said he will be fitted with a new
locator-radio and released.

Both birds were caught in the
same remote area of the Te-
hachipi foothills about 25 miles
south of Bakersfield.

‘ AC-2 was snared about noon
yesterday as he zeroed in on the
carcass of a. stillborn calf used
as bait.

AC-6 had gone for the same
bait about 19 hours earlier. After
his capture, he was taken by spe-
cial truck to the zoo, where he
was held in quarantine while he
was examined for lead in the
bloodstream and other possible
problems.

Cox said AC-6 is important to.
the zoo breeding program be-
cause he is not related to any of
the other birds in captivity
there. “Inbreeding,” she said,
“can lead to defective births, so
the capture of a bird with com-
pletely different genes is a big
step to making our breeding pro-
gram successful.”

Zoo spokeswoman Lorrie Coh-

. en said there is another reason,

too.

If AC-6 gets a relatively clean
bill of health, he will be placed in
a special flight enclosure next to
one shared by two other captive
condors —- a male named T0pa
T0pa and a female known as

‘Tama-Yawut —— in the hope that

his presence will encourage
T0pa Topa to mate by giving
him the idea that he has a little
competition.

CONTEMPORARY Magazine section - Sunday DENVER POST - April 27, 1986

Actress Betty White focuses her love of animals on Denver fund-raiser

By JOANNE DAVIDSON

Denver Post Society Editor

IKI, a frisky fryeanold silver-

' gray tabby, probably wished

she was out chasing mice, but

there she was late one after-

noon, sitting on the lap of one of
the hottest stars in Hollywood

today. .

“Sometimes,” sighed Betty White as she
stroked Kiki’s head, “I think my parents were
disappointed when I was born with only two
legs.”

She’s joking, of course, but the costar of
television’s hilarious sitcom “The Golden
Gir ” is dead serious when it comes to the
care and protection of animals. Seated on a
straight-backed chair in her sunsplashed suite
on the 11th floor of the new Hyatt Regency
Tech Center, White spent Over an hour last
week talking of her love for man’s four-legged
friends, her late husband (TV game show host
Allen Ludden) and the runaway success of her
newest show. ,

White was here to lay the groundwork for
“Beauties and Beasties,” a May 18 fund-raiser
for the Colorado-based Morris Animal Founda-
tion. The $75-per-person cocktail gala, to be
held at the Hyatt, features a parade of fashions
designed by the late Edith Head for such stars
as Marilyn Monroe, Jean Harlow, Bette Davis
and Grace Kelly, look-alike animals accompa-
nying the models, an hors d’oeuvre buffet and
auction. Patty Barnard is the chairman. ,

“Edith Head was a great lover of animals, especially
cats,” White recalled, "and when she said she wanted to do
a fashion show for the Morris Animal Foundation, I hit on
the idea of finding animals to match her Hollywood de-
signs. It was a tremendous job to write a script and get
everything coordinated, but when we were finished, every-
thing worked beautifully. We were to do the show in Ha-
waii, but six weeks before it was scheduled, in October of
1981, Edith Head died.” ”

At first, White said, there was talk of canceling the show.
“My husband had recently died and I guess we were afraid
that everyone’s spirits would be too low.” But the show did
go on. “It turned out to be a celebration, a very joyous
occasion,” White said. “The animals made it even more
fun because you can never predict what they’re going to do
on stage.” '

The Denver production will mark the second time
“Beauties and Beasties” has "been presented. Marcia
Cedars is lining up a macaw and several zoo animals, plus
assorted dogs, cats and a team of miniature horses to ac-
company models from Vannoy Talent as they sashay down
the ramp to the beat of music supplied by Pete Smythe and
Friends.

_ Betty White will provide the commentary.

“My “husband always said television was just a hobby;

that animals were my life,” said White, a veteran of seven

TV series, 20 years as hostess of the Tournament of Roses
Parade and numerous talk and game shows. “H e was prob-
ably right.” ,

The two met when Ludden was hosting “Password,” but
their relationship didn’t take off until they appeared in
summer stock months later in Cape Cod.

. “We were the two oldest fools in the world when we fell
in love,” she said, eyes misting. “He wanted to get married
right away, but it took me about a year to say yes. He died
just three days before our 18th anniversary — two days
after we had moved into the home we had built together in
Carmel —- and oh how I wish we would have had that extra
year together. We loved each other so much. The good
Lord only made one Allen Ludden; there won’t be another
one like him.”

.Ludden shared his wife’s fondness for animals. “Allen
didn’t realize how much he loved animals until he married
rue,” White said, “but we both did all we could for their
care and protection.”

Memorial contributions following his death were used to
construct a plaza outside the koala house at the Los Ange-
les Zoo, on whose board of directors Ludden had served.

f;1t’s a fitting tribute,” White said. “Allen would have loved
1 .”

White is president emeritus of the Morris Animal Foun-

dation. She has been a trustee of the Los Ange-
les 200 for 13 years (“I’d have been a zoo-
keeper were it not for show business”), and
serves on the board of the American Humane
Association

Although she has kept the Carmel home, her
primary residence is Los Angeles. “My work
keeps me busy, but I don’t lead what you would
call a ‘Hollywood life’ after hours. My friends
are mostly in the business . . . Mel Torme and
his wife, Mary Tyler Moore, Bea Arthur. I have
a friend — he’s an author - and we go to a lot

0 lvf

of movies, or to dinner, but not a lot of parties. Ewe/V

 




“I do some work for Actors and Others for
Animals and of course the Christmas party that
Allen and I did for Rancho Los Amigos. Next
week I’m doing an Elizabeth Arden fashion
show for the Motion Picture Mothers, taping
five game shows and standing by as my kitty is
photographed for a calendar. After that, I’ll do
the Variety Club Telethon.”

White enjoys the visibility “Golden Girls”
has brought. “1 don’t bitch about anything,”
she said. “It goes with the territory. If you get
uptight and don’t roll with the punches, you’re
not going to stay on top.”

Still, tension can mount. “When I get strung
out on pressure, I pack up the dogs and the cat
and drive to Carmel. That restores my sanity.”

Television is her favorite medium. “A lot of
my actor friends think theater is the only thing
in the world, but television’s my favorite. I’m a
child of television and love it dearly. I tell peo-
ple that if they’re watching bad television, it’s
their own darn fault because there is so much

from which to choose.” ,

Perhaps best known for her role as the ditzy Sue Ann
Nivens on the old “Mary Tyler Moore Show,” White, who
now stars as Rose on “The Golden Girls,” said she “felt
blessed” to have had two hit series to her credit.

“Until ‘Golden Girls,’ I thought I identified most with
Sue Ann — Allen always said Betty and Sue Ann were one
and the same, except for the fact that Betty can’t cook —
but there’s a lot of Rose in me, too, like our morality, love
of animals and penchant for telling boring stories.”

Wearing a bright maroon, navy and white print dress
and sensible shoes, White bore little resemblance to Rose,
who in one recent episode “gave in and let a man stay the
night. Unfortunately he died and she had a lot of explaining
to do the following morning."

Like her plucky character, White has no intention of
slowing down. “The older you get, the more wonderful it is
to find yourself still hanging in there. To me, at least, it
gets better all the time.”

HE DOG NOBODY WANTS

What can I do mom, it followed me home

About a month ago one of my

neighbor’s dogs tunneled under the

‘ fence and adopted us. And, I should
add, hasbeendrivingusstarkraving
mad ever since. According to my . .
husband, daughter, father, brother and
one son, this was not a spontaneous
adoption, due to the fact that I supposedly
"encouraged” the dog.

But now I ask you: Just what would

you at out of its yard and started
and wouldn’t let you
out of your own car --
or in your own back
door?

Well, I’ll tell you
what you’d do -— you’d
make friends with the
beast that’s what

vyoud —notonlytokeepthedamn

thing from attacking you, but to keep the

ice cream from melting on the seat next
to you. The first time the thing appeared
Ihadtogothroughhalfabox ofdog
biscuits just to get the groceries in.

When a day or two later one of the kids
tried to walk next door to his
grandparents’ house and came running in
screaming about this mad dog which
tried to attack him, I called my neighbor
again. And someone got the thing back in
_ — only for itto get back out again - that
day and every day since then.

'I‘hekidﬁnallyusedthebiscuittrickto
make friends with the animal in order to
get next door. My mother made friends

dog, which I am not at all convinced is all
dog, responded to this friendliness by
camping on my doorstep.

The doorstep was only the first step.
Soon she was following me. Where I
walked, she walked If I stopped, she
stopped; when I sat, she put her head in
my lap. True, she seemed to be getting
too close for comfort, but hanging around
is a step up from being growled at, in
your own yard. every day.

Then she started protecting me, one
son and my husband The mail carrier
couldn’t get near the house. The milk
deliverer couldn’t get out of his truck
V When a friend stOpped by early Easter
morning to leave surprise baskets in the _
yard, the dog not only tried to eat the
baskets but my friend as well

No, I didn’t “encourage” the dog, but I
did make a mistake, a big mistake. Late
on the night of the big snowstorm, I let

after hours of her alternating between
the front and back doors whining. and
scratching, while my own dogs did the
same thing inside, I gave in I told myself

. it was the neighborly thing to do. She

couldn’t get, or wouldn’t go, home. In
either case, the snow was deep, the dog

me nuts.

When the snow cleared, we attempted”
to repay the favor by bringing us gifts. To
my son she brought a dead pregnant field

jack rabbit and one tiny bunny. My
husband got the bird

Now there’s a limit to what I can take.
I called my neighbor: We’ve got to do
something, I said You can’t keep her in

I guess I expected cooperation vs. an
ultimatum. The pound means dead meat.
She won’t be claimed, she’ll be killed. My
neighbor knows it and accepts it. I know

it and won’t accept it. I said I’d get back

to him.

open door. I’ve called every friend I’ve
ever had and then some, but I can’t lie to
them. The animal is affectionate and

playful but she looks and acts more like a

P She’s afraid of most people and they’re

afraid of her. She doesn’t bite and likes
kids, but I’m not sure I’d trust her around
little ones, and she obviously can’t be
trusted around small animals.

The trouble with telling the truth is, no
one I talked to would even consider
taking her in. So I took a vote among
immediate and extended family
members to decide the fate of this dog
nobody wants. And a funny thing
happened. Most of the adults wouldn’t
vote: “It’s not curresponsibility . . . it’s
not your responsibility . . . if you hadn’t

‘ encouraged the dog . . . maybe it’s the

most humane thing to do . . . ”
Maybe, but kids don’t necessarily think

j didn’t get potty trained, you’d just put me
to sleep.”

Another commented: “So we’re

Humane Society putting on

he said. ‘ .

The organization will add an
animal cruelty investigation
team to handle complaints.

By MICHAEL DUNN

Tribune Staff Writer

A major renovation project at the Humane
Society of Tampa Bay will result in improved fa-
cilities and new services when completed this
summer, the organization’s director said Tues-
day.

The $325,000 project, which began about six
weeks ago, should be finished by July 1, said Hu-
mane Society Executive Director, Phillip R.
Snyder. He said the facility is being expanded
from about 750 square feet to about 1,150 square
feet.

It is the most extensive renovation project the

mane Society is hampered by a lack

of money, he said. .

The organization borrowed the
money for the renovations, but it
must depend on public donations to
pay the money back. The organiza-
tion receives no government fund-
ing, Snyder said.

“We’ve taken a chance building
this and adding a cruelty investiga-
tion position in the hopes the public
will respond,” he said.

“We desperately need contribu-

' tions to pay this back. We’re going

out on a limb because we need to be
an effective Humane Society and
that’s what we intend to do. But it’s
also important the residents of
Tampa Bay realize the importance
of the Humane Society.”

The public may send donations
to: Humane Society of Tampa Bay,
3607 N.’ Armenia Ave., Tampa, Fl
33607, or call 876-7138 for further in-
formation. .

organization has undertaken since the facility
was built in 1929 — and it’s long overdue, Snyder
said. '

“We want to provide a higher standard of hu-
mane care,” he said. “We’ve tried to lay it out not
only for the comfort of the animals but for the
public.”

The new facility, being built as an addition to
the current building off Armenia Avenue in

Tampa, will include 60 indoor-outdoor dog runs;
a puppy room; a stray cat room; a treatment and
examination room; an education department;
and new adoption counseling rooms. .

The facility currently can house about 80 ani-
mals comfortably, but it should be able to house "
about 200 when finished, Snyder said. The shel— .
ter receives about 12,000 animals a year, he 1‘
added. ;

The biggest change coming up in connection
with the project, however, is the creation of an ‘
animal cruelty investigation department, Snyder ~
said. The Humane Society receives 1,000 com- 2.
plaints of animal cruelty each year, he said, yet it 3'
must refer the complaints to other organizations, .‘
such as the Hillsborough County Animal Control. ,

“The Humane Society is here for the welfare .
of animals and to prevent cruelty to animals,” he ‘
said. “I think the Humane Society should be the
organization investigating animal cruelty. We

, have the right attitude and the knowledge to do
it.”

The cruelty investigation officer will look into " _,,_,,
allegations of animal abuse and take whatever ..
action is needed to protect the animal, Snyder '--- ~
said. Most cases of animal abuse are unintention- . .. .. .

’Dr. Spock Of Dogs’

'Canine Behaviorisf‘ To Be Speaker

At Humane Society Awards Banquet

By LINDA CANNINGTON

Mike Quattrochi is a true dog
lover. He has saved many an
“overly aggressive” dog from being
destroyed through his innovative
methods of teaching.

So innovative that some of his
students have become stars. Quat-
trochi has trained dogs to perform
in movies with Kenny Rogers such
as “Six Pack” and “The Slugger’s
Wife.”

Quattrochi has a special rela-
tionship with his pupils. He
doesn’t follow the traditional train-
ing methods of command and re-
ward, nor does-he punish his dogs
or use choke chains or muzzles.

Instead, Quattrochi gently ad-
monishes the dog and encourages
him to act for affection.

QUATTROCHI and his wife
Kathy operate “The Educated
Puppy,” a private boarding school,
out of their north Fulton home.
Quattrochi works with each stu-
dent personally, keeping detailed
notes on its disposition and
progress. The dogs stay with the
Quattrochis during their indivi-
dualized programs in sanitary,
comfortable surroundings designed
“to reduce stress.” There is even a
separate nursery, “purposefully

situated directly below our bed-
room.”

The rest of the facility includes
exercise yards, a kitchen prepared
for special diets, a bathing and
grooming area, a schoolhouse, a
reception area, and a private con-
sultation ofﬁce.

Quattrochi calls himself a “can-
ine behaviorist.” He begins each
session with his dog by observing
its personality and its family’s.

From there, he proceeds to teach
his pupils as much as they can
understand in a loving and patient
manner. In this way the dog enjoys
learning and progresses quickly,
often to the amazement of pre-
viously disgruntled owners.

“WE DON’T do anything rou-
tinely,” Quattrochi said, stressing
individuality. “By working with
the animal we determine the rou-
tine. Everything is flexible.

“We teach them that what they
do can get them deserved positive

results —— affection.”

Once referred to as the “Dr.
Spock” of dogs, Quattrochi keeps
in touch‘with former students. He
leaves instructions for owners to
follow to keep their dogs happy
and well-adjusted, and leaves a
phone number that the owner can

call for advice for the rest of his
dog’s life. He will even make house
calls.

Quattrochi is quick to point out
that he “modiﬁes behavior” and
that he is not a “dog psychologist.”
He likes to be called a “puppy
specialist” instead. '

QUATTROCHI periodically par—
ticipates 'in a ﬁve minute insert
program on Cable News Network
called “People and Pets.” His busi-
ness has grown steadily since he
began studying as an apprentice
11 years ago.

Quattrochi will be sharing suc-
cess stories and theories at the
Humane Society Awards Banquet
on May 3 at the DeKalb YWCA at
2362 Lawrenceville Hwy.

DeKalb Solicitor Ralph Bowden
will serve as master of ceremonies
and make award presentations to
outstanding volunteers.

Reservations are requested, and
each $8 ticket will buy hors
d’oeuvres, homemade lasagna, and
a choice of dessert. All money
raised will go toward helping ani-
mals.

The event begins at 6:30 p.m.
For more information, phone Shar-
olote Grafton at 662-1585. Reserva-
tions can be made at this number:
636-2357.

 




GRIT - April 22-24, 1986

Can Cattle, Sheep Use-Same Range?
Researchers Insist That They Can '

LOODY WARS on the open range
between cattlemen and sheepmen may
have been fought over a misconception.
Research shows that sheep and cattle
may graze the same land harmoniously, produc-
ing more pounds of meat than when the land is
exclusively grazed by a single species.
Multispecies grazing, as this system is called,
works because cattle prefer grass and just a few
forbs (herbs other than grass), whereas sheep
prefer forbs with a little grass.

STUDIES BY Dr. Dean M. Anderson, Dr. Clar-
ence V. Hulet, and graduate student John N.
Smith at the Jornado Experimental Range, a
193,000-acre station operated by the Agricultural
Research Service of the United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture near Las Cruces, N .M ., sug-
gest the multispecies grazing could help ranchers
raise additional livestock and boost income. They
said two conditions are especially important for
multispecies grazing: The range must be stocked
with the right number of animals, and it must
support growth of grasses, forbs and shrubs.

“If you put too many cattle and sheep on the
land and let them graze without supervision,
you’ll end up with pavement,” Anderson says.

DECATUR/DeKALB NEWS/ERA (Atlanta)
April 24, 1986

“They’ll graze the grasses and forbs right but of
existence.”

According to Anderson, the more diverse the
mix of vegetation, the more potential there IS for
grazing morehthan one species.

“Although we’re running two species of lives-
tock on the same land, they don’t seem to be
competing,” he adds. “In fact, when cattle and

sheep aren’t grazing together, some species of
plants go to waste.”

For example, sheep go for a forb called leather
croton, but cattle spurn it, Anderson says. On the
other hand, cattle like spectaclepod which sheep
neglect. By complementing each other’s eating
habits, both species better utilize the rangeland.

ANDERSON and Hulet are building on a
research tradition begun in the 19205 by the Texas
A&M University Research Station at Sonora.
Originally, those pioneer studies involved three
species: cattle, sheep and goats. In 1970, a fourth
species, deer, was incorporated into the Sonora
multispecies grazing research project. Deer -
vide an important source of income to ranchers in
surrounding Edwards Plateau region, attracting
guests who pay for hunting rights.

Tempo
Llamas
putting on
the dog

By Lois Reagan Thomas

lamas, those sturdy, docile

pack animals from Peru, are

gaining stature in the United

States as an investment, a
business and as pets—and conse-
quently as show animals.

The first internationally
sanctioned llama show in North
America will be held in May in 1a
Crosse, Wis. The sanction comes
from the recently formed American
Llama Show Association, which
has developed criteria for accredit-
ing judges and a uniform scoring
system for judging llamas.

This means llamas will be able to
accumulate points toward becom-
ing national champions, said Sonja
Moe, of the Mississippi Valley
Llama Association, the La Crosse—
based group formed to hold the
show.

Llamas will compete by age
groups in trail packing, pleasure
driving, endurance, Showmanship,
halter, wool and obstacle classes.
Some 200 llamas are expected to
be entered in the show, said Moe.

The Llama Extravaganza, as the
May 10—11 event has been termed,
also will feature a catalogue sale of
select, pedigreed llamas. The cata-
logue also has information on
starting a llama packing business,
raising llamas as pets or 4-H pro-
jects, training llamas and the health
and care of llamas.

Llamas have become the vogue
for pack animals in the United
States. They are used now in sever-
al national forests, including the
Great Smoky Mountains National
Park, in place of horses because
their padded feet do not damage
trails the way horses’ hooves do.

As pets, llamas are people-loving,
curious friends who express their
contentment through humming.
They require little shelter, even in
extreme weather, and are easy to
keep contained. As for the animals’
notoriety for spitting, Moe said
they rarely expectorate, and only
when pushed. Usually, spitting is
done by female llamas to fend off a
male’s advances, she said.

 

Larger llamas can be ridden.
They are good for pulling carts.
Some sheep ranchers use them in
the place of dogs to guard ﬂocks,
said Moe. Llamas are quick to
sense danger and will attack if their
young are threatened, she said. '

The animals also have a useful
by—product: their highly prized pre—
mium wool, which sells for $2 an
ounce. They don’t take kindly to
being sheared, however. The best
way to gain the wool is through
combing, said Moe.

Llamas also have value in death.
Their pelts make good fur coats.

The animals’ value, plus their
scarcrty in the United States,
means they are not inexpensive.
There are an estimated 7,000 to

O

10,000 in the United States. Some
are considered an investment, Moe
said. Breeding females range in
price from $10,000 to $20,000.

Sue, a 43-year-old Asian elephant at the Sacramento Zoo in Sac-
ramento, Calif., tips the scales at 9,300 pounds as part of a promotion
to raise money for a new chimp enclosure. The person coming
closest to guessing Sue’s weight received a gift and free admission to
the zoo for a year. The California Highway Patrol provided their new
digital truck scales for the weigh-in. Sue’s keepers practiced with
her for months to get her to stand on the scales. It took five keepers to
accomplish the weigh-in, four to read the scales and one to feed Sue
treats. Once on the scales, Sue had to stand still for three. seconds for
the keepers. to get an accurate reading. - . --' V . ' J .

zoo ATLANTA INTRODUCES BABY ELEPHANT
OFFICIALS HOPE PACHYDERM WILL BE START OF A REBUILT HERD.

By JOHN BRADY
News Writer

Twinkles the elephant

. touched off scandal at At-

lanta’s zoo, the 200 has a new, baby

elephant to promote efforts to re.

build the 200 into a first-class
attraction. _ '

The 3-year-old African elephant
was introduced to the public at the
zoo recently, and zoo director
Terry Maple said the acquisition is

Two years after the death of

the first step in building~ a herd of

three or four elephants.
The animal was purchased with
a gift from the John E. Galvin Chari-

~ table Trust, Maple said.

At the introduction ceremony,
the elephant was adopted by state

 

and Fulton County Republicans.
Checks for the first year’s upkeep
were presented to Maple by Scott
Hanson, chairman of the county
party, and James Morgan Ill, execu-
tive director of the state party.
Twinkles, a 13-year-old Asian
elephant that died after being trans-

ferred mysteriously to the owner of

a traveling circus, became a symbol
of the 200's troubles in 1984. Inves-
tigations turned up a series of-unex-
plained transfers of animals and re-
ports of‘ at least eight deaths of ani-
mals in a two—year span.

Zoo officials hope the new ele-
phant will become a symbol of ef~
forts to improve the 200. The ele-
phant will be used for promoting
the zoo in parades and other public
events, Maple said; '

 

Maple took over after the scan-
dal'and has moved to implement
plans for a massive redesign of the
Atlanta 200, renamed 200 Atlanta
not long ago. , . ,

Maple said the gradual estab—
Iishment of the elephant herd is
part of plan to turn a large section
of the zoo into an exhibit land-
scaped to look like the African sa-
vannahs, featuring giraffes, zebras,
rhinos'and other animals.

The baby elephant will be
named in a contest sponsored by a
local television station to be an-
nounced soon, Maple said.

The new elephant will share
space in the elephant compound
with Coca ii, a 40-year-old Asian el-
ephant that arrived in Atlanta in
1950 with similar fanfare. l




Lost and abandoned
ﬁnd Garland shelter

By BEVERLY POTTE
Staff writer -

For the unwanted and lost, it is a temporary
home until a better one can be found. But for
thousands of dogs and cats picked up off Garland
streets each year, it may also be their last stop.

More than 7,000 animals were brought to Gar-
land Animal Control at 600 Tower Drive from
October 1984 through September 1985. Of those.
1,067 were reclaimed by their owners, but only
602were adopted into new families, said Abe
Tuggle, animal control supervisor.

By city law, animals are kept at least 72 hours
at the shelter, but “typically we have some long-
er," Tuggle said. If the animals have tags. they
stay a minimum of six days.

Those not claimed are eventually euthanized.
The city has been using a decompression cham-
ber, which some critics say can cause pain to the
animals. Animal control ofﬁcials are considering
changing to a more accepted method, which
would use carbon monoxide to kill the animals.

Though most of the animals brought to the
shelter are dogs and cats. animal control officers

occasionally come across stray goats, ducks and
other farm animals. The lucky ones were kept at
the shelter’s petting 200, open for four months
last year in an effort to attract residents to the
animal control facility and encourage pet adop-
tions. It is expected to open again this summer.

Animal control officers answered 14,927 calls
during the year, and removed 3,002 dead animals
from the streets and veterinarian offices, Tuggle
said.

Most requests to pick up animals come from
residents who are annoyed by animals running
loose. But during patrols, animal control officers
also will pick up stray dogs they see on the
street. However, they rarely chase cats, unless
they receive a call.

“We recommend they use a cat trap. We just
can’t climb and do the things they (cats) do."
Tuggle said.

Cats and dogs can be adopted from the shelter
for $10, and adoptees must agree to have them
sterilized, vaccinated for rabies and registered.
Shelter hours are 10 am. to 6 pm. weekdays,
and noon to 2 pm. weekends.

LEO W. BANKS
Special to The Post

on and your spouse own a 3-
year-old basset hound
named Frank. He is hap-

py. He is fed regular meals, runs

in a grassy field on weekends and
sleeps at the foot ofthe bed every
night.

Then your child is born. Frank’s
meals are sometimes late. He is no
longer allowed to sleep in the bed-
room because of the crib. Frank is
exiled to the backyard when J u—
nior wants to crawl around the
house.

This upsets Frank. He barks,
digs holes and scratches at the
back door. He develops an upset
stomach that lasts for days. He
throws up on everything. The vet
gives him medicine. “Frank has a
virus,” the vet says.

A common situation, a common
treatment.

But Frank’s problem may not
be physical. He may suffer from
dog stress, a condition that can
cause countless behavior problems
-— chewing furniture, overturning
garbage, moping, howling, biting,

' scratching and soiling in the

house.
Dr. Juliet Rathbone, a veteri-

narian in Logan, Utah, who has a
special interest in animal behav—
ior, said dog stress, though com-
mon, is often not recognized by
owners, who conclude that the dog
is unmanageable.

It may not be recognized even
by veterinarians, the majority of
whom are not trained in pet psy-
chology.

What causes dog stress?

Just about anything -— separa-
tion from the owner, seeing the
owner pack a suitcase, inconsis-
tency in discipline, a visit to the
vet, a change in diet, a change in
routine, such as the owner retir-
ing, being left in the car, lack of
exercise, lack of attention or poor
nutrition.

Dr. Peter Borchelt, director of
the behavior clinic at the Animal
Medical Center in New York City,
said separation anxiety is the most
common cause of dog stress.

“An awful lot of dogs have great
difficulty being left alone,” Bor-
chelt said. “I see several cases a
week of dogs who howl all day
when left alone and that can be a
real problem in the city.”

 

HOUSTON POST - April 13, 1986

Dogs experience feelings,toc

Behavior changes often indicate some stress in pet's life

Treatment of dog stress can 1n-
volve behavior modification, anti-
anxiety drugs or a combination of
the two.

“My job is to reduce the dog’s
anxiety in the situation that pro-
duces it,” Borchelt said.

He usually proceeds by making
a house call to analyze the lifestyle
of the dog and the owner, deciding
on a method of treatment and
teaching the owner how to admin-

ister it. Then he monitors the situ-
ation by telephone. "

He said the analysis, treatment
and follow-up normally cost $100-
150. In a good week Borchelt sees
10 cases.

For separation anxiety, Bor-
chelt sometimes uses a behavior
modification technique called
gradual exposure —— getting the
dog accustomed to absences of one
minute, then two minutes, then
longer.

Eventually, over a period of
time and with much patience on
the owner’s part, the dog gets used
to being alone.

Dr. Frank Armer, a Phoenix,
Ariz., veterinarian, said dogs who
suffer from separation anxiety
while their owners are at work
usually do most of their damage
about an hour before the owner re-
turns because the animal’s anxi-
ety level has risen in anticipation
0f the homecoming.

“ As a corrective measure, he rec-
ommends that owners vary their
routines.

“The dog’s internal clock tells
him when you are supposed to be
home and if you vary your pattern,
his clock gets deactivated,”
Armer said.

Rathbone said aggression is a
common response to separation.

She said dogs are pack animals
that attain rank in the pack by ag-
gression. When separated from the
pack, or the family, they try to re-
enter with aggressive behavior —
sometimes directed at another dog
or even a baby.

Rathbone said she treated one
case involving two dogs that had
grown up in the same household.
One was a 10-year-old Chihuahua
named Cous-Cous and the other
was an 8—year-old mongrel named
Gretchen.

Cous-Cous got sick and under-
went surgery, after which she re-
turned home to much fanfare and
attention from the family.

This greatly upset Gretchen
and, in a fit of jealousy, she at-
tacked Cous-Cous, sending her
back to the hospital for more sur-
gery.

The owners were afraid to bring
Gretchen and Cous-Cous back to-
gether and summoned Rathbone,
who used a behavior modification
technique called the “jolly rou-
tine.”

When both dogs are together,
the owners act happy to the point
of absurdity. Then the owners,
each with one dog, place the ani-
mals in separate rooms, but close
enough so they can see and smell
each other.

Each owner continues to act jol-
ly, getting the dogs excited and in-
volved in the situation, all the time
moving the dogs closer and closer
together.

If there is any sign of aggres-
sion, don’t punish them, just back
them off a step and continue the
“jolly routine,” Rathbone said.

Soon the dogs are peacefully re-
united.

Rathbone’s therapy for Cous-
Cous and Gretchen took about an
hour a day for a month. But it
worked.

Probably the second most com-
mon cause of dog stress is incon-
sistent treatment. by the owner,

Rathbone said.

Example: The wife aggressively
disciplines the animal for getting
into the kitchen garbage, but the
husband does not.

This confuses and upsets the
dog, who wants more than any-
thing to please his owner, but does
not have the mental capacity to
understand such uneven disci-
pline.

Borchelt said bona fide phobias,
such as fear of traffic, thunder-
storms, gunshots, the vacuum
cleaner and loud city noises, can
also cause stress.

“If you move a dog from the
country to Manhattan, he freaks
out, just like most people,” Bor-
chelt said.

He said there is no data to sup-
port the contention that various
breeds respond differently to
stress, but he has noticed an inter-
esting phenomenon in his own
practice -— most of the cases of
thunderstorm phobias occur in big
dogs such as Saint Bernards and
mastiffs.

“You just don’t find many Yor-
kies with a thunderstorm phobia,”
he said.

 

 




He said it is just a hunch, but it
could be that little dogs are pam-
pered, and during a thunderstorm
the owner picks them up and pets
them.

“It is pretty hard to pick up a
Saint Bernard or a mastiff,” he
said.

On the question of how different
breeds respond to stress, there are
as many opinions as there are ani-
mal behaviorists.

Bonnie Beaver, professor of vet-
erinary medicine at Texas A&M
University, said retrievers, Ger-
man Shepherds and Doberman
pinschers are mouth-oriented and
tend to chew when stressed.

But terriers, dachshunds and
bassets dig because they have
been bred to go after varmints
with the head down.

Katherine Houpt, professor of
physiology at Cornell University,
said beagles and huskies originally
were bred to hunt in packs and re-
act badly to being left alone.

Armer said small breeds, such
as Chihuahuas, tend to be high— __

 

strung and likely to respond more
dramatically to stress than more
lethargic bassets and beagles.

The following are general sug-
gestions for dealing with dog
stress:

[I] The animal, just like people,
has a routine and it should be fol-
lowed as closely as possible.

D Exercise is essential. A tired
dog does not have the energy to
generate anxiety.

. El Don’t crowd your dog out. He
IS an active, participating member
of your family and needs to be-
long.

.Finally, a comment by Armer
might help to put your dog’s be-
havmr in perspective: “There is
very little abnormal behavior in

dogs. There is just behavior we
don’t like.”

Matchmaker’s pet project is with elderly

People and pets don’t always get along. as
evidenced by how many animals are turned
over to the humane societies each year. That’s
why a group called PACT takes special pains in
locating the proper pets as companions for old
people living alone.

By MAUD S. BEELMAN
Associated Press Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. —- Dan Lago is a
matchmaker with academic credentials, look-
ing for the right companions for old people.

Pets are his project.

Lago, a professor of gerontology at Pennsyl-
vania State University, first became interested
in the effect pets had on older people while
working on his doctorate on loneliness. He was
struck by how often during an interview an
older person would call a dog to sit in on the
conversation.

That led him to found PACT -— People and
Animals Coming Together -- a private, non-
profit organization that takes a scientific ap-
proach to finding the right pets for people 55
and older who are living alone.

One thing that sets PACT apart from similar
organizations is that each recipient of a pet is
assigned a permanent volunteer or sponsor who
helps with the care of the pet and will take the
animal back if things don’t work out.

“The part that is unique is their attempt at a
careful match of an individual with a perma-
nent pet and then the assignment of a PACT
member to be a sponsor and a support person,”
says Linda Hines, executive director of the
Delta Society, based in Renton, Wash, which
acts as a national clearinghouse of information
about pet-people programs.

Lago says pets and people don't always get
along.

"All you've got to do is look at the figures on
animals that are turned in to shelters every

year to recognize that the human-animal bond,
however desirable and powerful it might be,
doesn’t occur automatically in every relation-
ship with an animal," he says.

But for many elderly people, says PACT
volunteer coordinator Diane Tlmbiin, a pet of-
fers love and companionship.

“For people that are housebound, without
much human contact, they're the difference be-
tween happiness and real unhappiness,” she
says.

And the animal’s playfulness "lets you
lighten up on life.” Timblin says. “You forget
how sore your back is."

Dora.Mae Andre, a 77-year-old PACT mem-
ber with a Pekingese named Mandy, agrees.

“She's just like part of the family. I’m alone,
I live alone and she really, really is an awful lot
of company.”

And taking care of Mandy helps Andre
remember to take care of herself, she said.

"Because I am busy and do a lot of running
in and out probably I wouldn't take a lot of time
to eat. So when I give Mandy something, I feel I
should give myself a little something.”

Andre is one of many PACT members who
shares her pet with area nursing home resi-
dents. “When you get talking to them and take
your pet, they open up and say, “Well, I had a
dog. I had a cat,’ ” she said. "You know this is
filling that void.”

PACT, which now has about 40 volunteers
and about 70 current clients whose average age
is in the late 703, has been successful in about 70
percent of its placements, Lago says. When
matches have failed it’s usually been due to the
extreme shyness or hyperactivity of the animals
or the poor health of the owner. From experi-
ence, Lago stays away from puppies and dogs
over 35 pounds.

Most of PACT's customers come through re-
ferrals. The first step is an interview with a

‘-..._.._..,—. __. a- ...,

PACT volunteer to determine the person’s
health, home life, financial status and attitudes
towards animals. That information is turned
over to an animal selection committee, which
contacts pet owners, breeders or animal shel-
ters. All PACT animals are donated.

Once a possible match is found, PACT ar-
ranges for a neutral meeting site where the per-
son and animal can get acquainted.

“We find that if we bring an animal right
into someone’s home and say, ‘Here's a dog, do
you want to think about owning it?’ they tend
not to be very discriminating,” Lago says.
“They'll say, ‘Oh great, here's my dog, you
brought me my dog.’ "

PACT offers pre-placement health care,
licensing and basic training. It also assists with
veterinarian and food bills, when needed, and
sponsors help with pet-sitting, grooming or exer-
cising, as well as transportation to the vet. Spon-
sors sometimes are called on for grief counsel-
ing when an owner's pet dies.

PACT was begun in 1981 as part of a re-
search project Lago was conducting with fund-
ing from a private foundation.

Lago began compiling sample groups of eld-
erly to study. One group took pets from PACT
and had the follow-up services. One group con-
sisted of current pet owners. The others were
former owners and people who had never
owned pets.

From 1982 to 1984, Lego interviewed about
350 participants to try to see whether owning a
pet affected, the person’s physical health or so-
cial relationships.

Lego found that "simply owning an animal
doesn't have any relationship as far as we can
tell with health or morale.”

But among the 184 current pet owners he
studied, he said, those who were particularly at-
tached to their animals seemed happier.

Adams: To kill any animal. from a shell-
fish to an elephant. not because anyone is
hungry or ill. or in need of some pharmacologi-
cal product. but for no better reason than lux-
ury. vanity and adornment and the money to
be made therefrom. is morally unacceptable.
This extends to killing an elephant for ivory.

ing of any animal life for human purposes —
that is the animal rights philosophy as ex-

pressed by Peter Singer in the book ”Animal
Liberation." The animal rights philosbphy is

that since Darwin. at least. has shown us that ~

we are on the same continuum with the ani-
mals. we can‘t really make a distinction be-
tween humans and animals in terms of moral
rights. and therefore there is no moral or philo-
sophical right to treat an animal in any way
you wouldn't treat another human being. And
it is following from that philosophy that ani-
mal rights is against. for example. sealing or
furs or the raising of animals for food, or the
use of animals in medical or scientific re-
search.

1 think it‘s important to make that clear.
because on the one hand we've got a concept of

lic is sympathetic to. which has to do with us-

for food: and if you apply that to furs you
would say. well, you must have proper cages
on ranches or you must have proper humane
traps for taking them. But i think it should be
understood that animal rights is not really

they're taken from or whether they‘re endan-
gered or not.

animals at all.’

     
   
     




  

I don’t think the majority of

people in this society are ready to
accept the animal rights proposi-
tion that we have no right to kill
animals at all, the proof being
that the vast majority of people
are using and eating meat.
Adams: I’m afraid the gentle-
man is intoxicated with the exu-
berance of his own verbosity. I’m
not talking about issues of this
kind at all. I'm simply opposed to
the luxury fur industry, which I
think is cruel and evil.
Hemovicl: i think a vegetar-
ian would say that meat eating is
a luxury industry as well. How is
the fur industry exactly a luxury
industry? Because it‘s promoted
as a fashion industry, but if you

 

look at the production side. which

7 I’ve done in quite considerable
depth, then you see that it’s people
living on the land, whether it's
ranchers or whether it’s white
trappers or whether it’s aborigi-
nal people, and certainly in the
case of northern Canada. there is
simply no alternate employment.
It’s often part of subsistence liveli—
hood, and is anything but a luxu—
ry industry. 80 we should be care—
ful how we throw around terms,
like what is luxury? I mean, you
know, are video recorders luxury?
ls the meat industry a luxury in-
dustry? .

. Adams: (To the reporter.) Is he
finished? He was talking, i think,
about livelihood. If a man comes to
the door selling oranges and says.
“Lady. I‘m. selling oranges and it

is my livelihood,” you’re not under _
a moral obligation to buy those or—
anges. '
We shall destroy the fur indus—
try by destroying people’s (1681113
or motivation or wish to wear fur
because they are aware of its use
lessness and the cruelty involved.
And this will destroy the luxury
fur industry in my own country, I
think by the end of the 20th cen— _
tury. And in this country, perhaps
’ by the year 2020. 2030, the indus-
‘ try will die as the Newfoundland
harp-seal slaughter died, because
people no longer will buy the fur.

When we stop buying, animals‘

will stop dying. _
The furriers are not particular-

ly to be blamed any more than
' prostitutes are to be blamed. I was
talking to a young prostitute
about 40 vears ago in Alexandria.
I asked her how she felt about the
morality of the thing, and she
said, ”The morality really has
nothing to do with me. There is a
demand, and I supply it. One
shouldn’t be too quick to blame

 

 

the furriers. They’re just like poor
little prostitutes; as long as there
is a demand. they will supply it.

-Our battle is for the hearts and

minds of the public, and when
they realize how vile and cruel
this business is, and stop buying
the furs, like Princess Diana, then

i the industry will die in the same

way that the Newfoundland harp
seal slaughter died. _ .
Herscovici: Really, Richard,
you throw around moral categor-
ies; you’re so sure of yourself, I just
hardly know where to begin. You
throw out the harp seal market

,being destroyed, you say it. so

blithely. Greenpeace recently was .
invited up to Greenland by Inuit

people who wanted" to show them
what the destruction of the .mar— .

ket had done to sealing communi—
ties. Allen Pickover, who I believe
was then head of Greenpeace In~
ternational, after he toured and
visited and saw the communities.
said, "You know, we really had no
idea what the sealing community
was like when we were doing this
campaign. It’s very hard to pic-
ture, the life of people in a commu-
nity like this. when you’re living
in England or in Europe. Perhaps,
if we had known about it then, we
could have avoided it.” he said.
You know,.I think it’s very nice of
him to say that, but I think it’s
quite shocking after a 10-year
campaign, a multimillion—dollar
campaign using all kinds of re-
sources and speaking in the name
of morality, that afterwards, after
the fact, after you've caused this
hardship on so many people, that
you say, well really, we didn’t
know. I mean you think you'd
want to know first.

I Greenpeace shortly after that
ended, withdrawing its antifur
campaign, saying, “We’re going to
take more consideration about the

role of the fur trade for aboriginal
‘ people.” The people of Greenpeace

UK. who were running the cam-
paign in Britain. including, I
think, Mr. Adams, simply spun off
and created a new group called
LYNX to continue the campaign
using the same materials and the
same film and certainly new ma‘
terials. but they were not con-
strained by the forces that were
constraining Greenpeace, which

were, among other things. consid-’

eration for aboriginal peoples.
We speak in the name of mo-

rality and compassion but when
you see the hardship, I mean liter-
al despair that was caused by the
seal ban, I would be a little bit con-
cerned about what you’re going to
do to communities of people. How
can vouclaim to be having such

 

great compassion when you don’t
even appear to be that interested
in finding out about the people
that you’re going to hurt?

And I would just say that some-
one who is not apparently that
concerned about the human popu—
lation,.I would really wonder how
concerned they'could pretend to
be about the animal population. If
you can’t even appreciate the live-
lihood of other people whose cul-
ture is somewhat different from
yours. I would ask how are we
supposed to listen to your moral
values about animalkind? And

'then, in terms of this blithe
phrase, “When we stop buying, '
. they’ll stop dying,” well, of course,
that’s a nice religious slogan, but
it’s not true; animals will continue
to suffer and die in the wild
whether or not we trap them. Na-
ture will find its own ways to
maintain the balance. But na-
ture’s ways of maintaining popu—
lation balances are not necessar-
ily less cruel than man’s. In fact, '
nature is very often more cruel.
whether it's disease. or predation
or fighting within species. In a
habitat where the populations get
too high,'you can see it even on
the pelts; you know the gashes in
;it, the holes in it are from the
'fighting. A female muskrat will
gdevour her own young. she’ll at~
ftack other muskrats; they’ll fight
to the death when the population
i densities get too high. When fox or
other populations get too high
they become more susceptible to
all kinds of diseases. But it is true,
A of course, that the carcass would
, be hidden away in the bush where
you wouldn’t have to see it, and
you wouldn’t have a leg~hold trap
to hold up and you wouldn't have
a trapper to hold up as a scape—

goat in front of the camera.
. Adams: {to reporter) Let him go

' on talking. We shall destroy the

fur industry.
- Herscovici: You might destroy
the fur industry, but I’m saying
: that what wins might not always
be good. The sealing industry is
' for now, eliminated. I don’t think
i it is for the good. It’s caused a lot
{of hardship in communities that
iwere dependent upon it. If there is
nothing wrong with it in terms of
the numbers, of how the hunt was
monitored, and if the species were
not endangered, Which has now
been shown they were not, and if
the hunting methods are humane,
then I would say, why on earth
would you want to destroy it? You
know, this industrialized society
seems to want to destroy every-
thing that’s in its path that is dif—
ferent than itself. But in fact it’s
this industrial society which is the
real enemy of wildlife and of habi-
tat.

 

  




i
.l

Richard’s side is very easy.
Richard can just say, “It is cruel
and i want it to end." To try to ex-
plain the ecological side is a little
more complicated. And I would
just ask Richard a question then:
How do you respond to this eco—
logical problem. that the interna-
tional Union for the Conservation
of Nature, in its world conserva-
tion strategy, has said that often
the best way to protect wildlife
and their habitats against com-
peting industrial and agricultural
interests, is to use. to make some
use of the wildlife? And how do
you answer that? You may stop
trapping but I don’t think that by
"doing that you’re necessarily do-
ing a service to wildlife or to the
habitat. And that’s our real prob-
lem.

Adams: I’m afraid i didn’t un—
derstand the question.

Herscovici: I said the real dan-

 

ger to wildlife and to wildlife habi-
tat today is the infringement on
habitat by industrial society, by
people, by agriculture.

Adams: Could I ask a ques—
tion? is it cruel? .

Herscovici: ls what cruel?

Adams: The fur industry.

Herseovici: All right, that’s a
good question. On the one hand
ranching, which probably takes
in well over half the furs ‘- shall
we talk about that first?

Adams: No, answer the ques-
tion.

Herscovici: OK. Ranching. i
would argue, is not significantly
different from raising animals for
livestock. Now maybe i should ask
you a question. Are you against
the raising of livestock for food?

Adams: Answer my question.

Herscovici: l would argue that
the fur industry is not any more
cruel than raising livestock for
food. in fact it’s probably less cru—
el because one of the cruelest parts
of raising livestockfor food is the

transportation of that livestock to

the abattoir - you know that’s
been shown, that one of the most
stressful parts. even more'stress—
ful perhaps than the kill, is the
transportation, being loaded on a
truck. in close confines, unloaded
and so on, whereas the fur bear-
ers, the mink or the fox. are killed
in the pens or right near the pens
where they’re actually raised, by
the people who are actually feed-
ing them all the time, and so it’s
probably less cruel than raising
animals for food.

Adams: So the argument is
that two blacks make a white. I
asked him a question, he said.
“Oh yes, it is cruel and it’sjust as
cruel as livestock.”

Herscovici: i didn‘t say it was
cruel. I said it’s certainly no more

. cruel than . . .

Adams: You said that both
these things are cruel. Thank you
very much. You agree it’s cruel?

Herscovici: Well, let’s get
something . . . '

Adams: We’ll now go to the
next question. - 4

Herscovici: i asked you a
question at the beginning and yen
never answered it. i said animal
rights are not just against the fur
industry, they‘re against any use
of wildlife including the raising for
food. And you dodged that. very
skillfully. But why don’t you an~
swer it? I mean are you also
against the raising of animals for
food?

Adams: No, l’m talking about
the fur industry.

Herseovici: Why do you not
want to answer that question?

Adams: l’m not here to talk
about the raising of animals for
food.

Herscovici: Well, it’s all tied
together, because id say in a soci-
ety that eats meat, it is perfectly
hypocritical to just pick out the
fur industry. Peter Singer, who
wrote sort of the bible of the move—
ment, says the same thing in his
book. He says that to attack the
Newfoundland seal hunt in a soci—
ety where you're eating battery
chickens is as hypocritical as at-
tacking apartheid in South Africa
while you tell your nextodoor
neighbors not to sell their houses
to blacks. So are you against the
raising of livestock for food?

Adams: No, l’m here to talk
about the luxury fur industry. It is
a cruel and evil business which
we will destroy by destroying the
public demand for it. it is cruel. It
is a most evil business involving
great torment and pain and mis—
ery. And it will be destroyed by en-
tirely peaceful methods by moti-
vating the whole of Western soci—
ety not to wish to buy more fur.

Herscovici: So you don’t want
to answer the question whether
you’re against the livestock indus-
try? 1 can understand someone
who says, "I’m a vegetarian. I

don’t want to eat animal flesh and
therefore i also don't want to use
furs.” I think it‘s very different
from that personal stance to orga-
nize a multimillion-dollar cam-
paign using media and all kinds of
skillful PR techniques, to wipe out
an'industry where the people in~
volved are incapable of having the
same access to the media.

Mr. Adams realizes that people
like trappers and ranchers and
native people really can be politi~
cally isolated, have very little ac—
cess to the media, and that they

have very little capacity to defend
themselves. They’re often people
living in remote areas who are not
trained to address the media, who
don’t live in cities. and that’s why
Peter Singer called the fur indus-
try a “soft,” target. ,

There is nothing more abhor—
rent about the fur trade than
there is about livestock raising
and i think it should be discussed
on that basis. Singer says when a
society understands that we
shouldn’t eat. meat, then the fur
trade will disappear by itself. A
very different thing, i think, to
target a group of people for the
sole reason that there is very little
information available to the pub-
lic about how trapping is really
conducted. Now i don’t know. for
all i know Mr. Adams doesn’t
know a great deal about how trap-
ping is conducted or about hu-
mane trap research or about how
the species are monitored. 1 sus-
pected this morning when I spoke
to him and he told me that in
mink ranches the minks run up
and down the side of the cages
and are insane within two days.
that perhaps he hasn’t been to a
mink ranch because minks cer-
tainly don’t run up and down
their cages and act. totally neurotv
ic. He said. ”I have films.” I’ve
seen that film clip and the picture
of mink running around like
crazy. Well. obviously, those mink
were disturbed — by the cameras
or the lights or‘ intentionally,
whatever — but they certainly are
not the way mink look in a mink
ranch.

Well, anyone who has a pet
knows that one of the first things
that. is affected if your pet is not
well cared for and not well nour-
ished is the quality of its coat, so if
only for purely selfish reasons it is
in the vested interest of, say, mink
ranchers to be sure that those ani—
mals are well cared for, and if they
were totally insane as is being ar—
gued, obviously their pelts would
be worthless. No, I do not think
that raising those animals on for
farms is inordinately cruel in com-
parison to the rest of the society.

No more cruel than it is to build
‘ huge cities that pollute and de-

stroy the environment.
Adams: I see little point in this
discussion. I think it’s become un—

‘ profitable. This is not a dialogue.

This is an endless flow of uninter-
rupted nonsense.

At this point, Adams got up
and walked out of the room. and
the building.

Joan Shelton, 35, gave up accounting '
.7 eight years ago to groom dogs. In 1983, ,
:; she opened Groomingdale ’s, a mobile
:1; service that clips and primps some of
f}. Dallas’ most pampered pedigreed pups
and most loved mutts. Shelton, who
lives in Dallas with her “Schnorkief’
Sam, recently talked with staff miter

Bill Gordon.

How much does it cost to have a dog ‘

bathed, clipped and combed?

The fee depends on the dog and how
much work his coat needs. My mini—
mum fee is $22. I have a twice—a-week
customer who spends $60 a week.

Doesn’t a powdered poodle with matching
pink bow and pink toe nails make you se—

No. 1 probably did it. Painting toenails '

isn’t my major purpose in life, but I

think it’s wonderful. The money we

spend on our pets is no worse than the
money we spend on ourselves. You

:might refuse to spend $25 to get your

dog groomed but think nothing of
spending $25 for a new necktie.

Do dog's demand special cuts?
You have to follow the basic standard

cuts regulated by the American Kennel

Club. But I do a lot of cosmetic groom-
ing. Lhasa Apsos, for example, are bow
legged, so I scissor the inside of the leg
longer than the outside to make them
appear straight. On overweight dogs, I

do a lot of blending with thinning shears
and buffing blades to create a much
more sleek appearance.

How do dogs feel about powder and —
bows? .

They like to lookpretty. I can tell the
difference between a dog walking from
the house to the truck and the truck to
the house. They literally prance on the '
way back. A lady once brought in two
old, old poodles. She wanted bows and
polish, but couldn’t make up her mind
what color. I asked whether she was go-
ing any place special so we could color
coordinate with her outﬁt. She just said

loved to look pretty, and she
wanted them to die looking
pretty. She was on her way to
the vet to have them put to
sleep.

What’s the cutting edge of dog
fashion? Any dogs into punk cuts?

The weirdest request I ever
had was for a Siberian husky. A
kid was going to a party and
wanted a punk haircut for his
dog. I tried to talk him out of it,
but he was set on it. He had me
shave a Mohawk down the dog’s
back. With sissors, I sculpted cir-
cles, diamonds, triangles. I
shaved one side of the face. His
mother kept coming in yelling,
‘Your father’s going to kill you.’

How about pierced ears or cos-
metic surgery for dogs?

No. I have seen a dog with

braces, a Lhasa with a severe
underbite.

Dog cosmetics?

Colognes are very valid for
dogs. Let’s face it, dogs can
smell bad. We use special dog
colognes. Some owners use peo-
ple cologne on their pets. I have
a little Yorkie who bathes in Es-
tee Lauder Youth Dew. Mamma
and the dog both wear Youth
Dew.

Are most of your clients wealthy
society dogs?

Most are mutts. Their owners 7

aren’t rich. They just love them,
and mutts are the most wonder-
ful to work on. I love purebred
dogs, but given a choice I proba-
bly choose a mutt with one of
those only-a—mother-could-love
faces.

No one names dogs Rex, King or
Prince, anymore. What’s popular

in pet names?

I don’t have a single Fiﬁ,
which is wonderful. Samantha is
real big. And I see a lot of Ce-
dries, Ryans, Duncans.

Are the new breeds of yuppie
puppies — Akitas, shar peis — an
improvement over traditional
breeds? .

They’re low-maintenance
dogs. They do require bathing, .
and shar peis are difﬁcult to
bathe. You have to pull back all
those wrinkles to wash them
and then pull the skin back
again to get the soap out and
again to dry them. It’s like
scrubbing elephant hide.

Do you groom other pets?

I do a lot of cats. Today, I had
a stop at a house with a mutt,
two Yorkies, two great Danes,
nine cats and seven geese. I
don’t do geese.

By JACQUIELYNN FLOYD- -
Staff writer '

After six years of dramatic ar-
rests, cross-country manhunts and
red-hot, nose-to-the-ground pur-
suits, a veteran of the Arlington
police department will retire at the
end of the month.

He won’t get a pension or a gold
watch, but if he’s good he might

. get a cookie.

Nine-year-old Rogue, a 85-pound
German shepherd, is turning in his
badge because of worsening arthri-
tis in his hind legs. On retirement
day, the city will give him to offi-
cer David Kruckmeyer, who has
been Rogue’s around-the-clock
companion for the past two years.

In the past three weeks, Rogue
has cornered two burglars, one of
whom was overlooked by police
searching a building. During his

career, he has apprehended 22 fel-
ony and five .misdemeanor
suspects. ,

And Rogue once saved his part
ner’s life. During a robbery investi.
gation, a suspect pulled a handgun
from his pocket and pointed it at
Kruckmeyer’s chest.

“I’m desperately going for my
gun and it’s not coming out of my

, holster fast enough,” Kruckmeyer

recalled. On a one-word command,
Rogue sprang toward the gunman
in a single running leap. The sus-
pect turned and fled without fn'ing.

Kruckmeyer will get a new part-
ner and he’s concerned about
ROgue’s feelings when he brings
home another dog. j

“I’m going to spend some tim
taking him out with the new dog so
he knows he’s still important to
me,” Kruckmeyer said.

Sa ve 1a b animals before failing activists

California congressman
George Brown has introduced a
bill, HR 2654, which would make
it a dreadful crime, with years of
imprisonment plus monetary
fines, to break into a federally
funded animal research facility.

Yet, had it not been for just
such break-ins by the Animal
Liberation Front, the general
public and our Washington legis-
lators might never have passed
another of Mr. Brown’s bills, the
Improved Standards for Labora-
tory Animals Act. Without the
dramatic film footage, taken by
the experimenters themselves,
and veterinarians’ reports on the
sad condition of the rescued ani-
mals, conditions unrelated to the
research, no one would have
been convinced of the cruelty
gomg on in many animal labora—
tories.

,_ I most certainly do not advo-
cate that laboraties be vandal-
ized nor that records be de-
stroyed. But neither do I believe
that cruelty should remain hid-
den behind closed doors in re-
search facilities. '

 

Congressman Brown could use
his time better were he to con-
centrate on funding the Animal
Welfare Act, since the Reagan
budget contains not one penny
for its enforcement. Which, of
course, means that it will be
business as usual for research-
ers, no matter what laws are
passedto protect animals.

Family was strange, say neighbors '

Rats, animal bodies fill house}

SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (UPI) -
A house that was home to hun-
dreds of rats and other animals —-
some of them dead -- was ordered
fumigated with cyanide as a
health hazard Saturday by a
health officer who recommended
it be destroyed.

The family who lived in the
home — called “the Addams fami-
ly” by a neighbor -- was earlier
told to leave.

Police were called Friday
evening to the rented house of
William and Barbara Shepard in
the suburb of Niskayuna after a
neighbor reported the Shepards’
yard was covered with rats.

“I flipped,” said neighbor Sec-
cerdia Smith. “I couldn’t believe
all the rats. They were all over the
place, everywhere you looked.”

Smith described his neighbors
as “strange” and said their 34-

year-old daughter, Linda, would
feed animals in the yard.

“I like to call them the Addams
family,” Smith said in a reference
to a New Yorker magazine car-
toon series and television series
about a bizarre family.

Dr. John Clowe, the town’s
health officer, inspected the house
Saturday and said there may be
hundreds of rats in the house and
ordered it fumigated with
cyanide. He said the house was “a
great health risk.”

“The greatest problem is that'
these rats do carry disease and if
there are that many rats there,
they can spread to the other
houses in the area,” he said. “I’m
going to recommend to the town
board that the house be de-
molished.”

Deputy Chief John Waterfield

CHRONIClE SCIENCE EDIf OR

Dr. Birute Galdikas, the world’s leading
orangutan expert, watched wistfully
from across a moat at the San Francisco 200
as five of the great apes frolicked on their
swings and poles.

She admired the agility and friskiness
of the rust-colored animals, but despite 14
years of living among wild orangs in the
jungles of Borneo, she was not allowed to
get near the peaceable San Francisco resi-
dents. _

Galdikas has spent more than 20,000
hours documenting the history of the rare
apes that live only in Indonesia’s; vanishing

rain forests on Borneo and northern Suma-
tra.

She knows them intimately, for her
Borneo home is a cluster of primitive wood-
en houses deep in a swampy jungle clearing.
Wild orangs visit the camp where she and
her husband and two young children live,
and she spends hours each day wandering

through the jungle studying the solitary
lives of the shy beasts.

So shy are the orangs that they rarely
approach a human, but Galdikas has devel-
oped a special, if distant, relationship with
one tree-dweller named Sam, who lives not
far from her camp.

“When I’m observing the animals and
taking notes,” she said, “I‘ll sometimes see
Sam peering down at me. He watches me
arrive and watches me go, and I get the
impression he’s almost waiting for me. He’ll
stare directly into my eyes, and his eyes
never leave mine..l get the feeling he must
be thinking about me, and it can be very,
very disconcerting.”

sisted, for orangs are f ruit~eaters and rarely
aggressive.

Adult males can weigh as much as 200 ,.
pounds and are so strong they could easily
tear down the houses in the naturalist’s
camp. But they don’t.

“They’ll hang from the window frames i
and look in on us, but something psychologi~
cal inside them keeps them from breaking -
in,” she said. “So out there in the jungle it’s \
we humans who live in cages, not the ani-
mals.”

No one knows how many wild, orang-
utans there are, but their numbers are

dwindling as Indonesian farmers
clear the forests for plantations of
rice and corn.

As a naturalist at home among
apes as well as humans, Galdikas
feels a special kinship to the animals
she studies.

Looking fondly across the moat
toward Rusty, the San Francisco
zoo’s huge, shaggy adult male, she
noted that great apes are mankind’s
closest relatives on the evolutionary
tree. Molecular geneticists, in fact,
have determined that the earliest
prehumans diverged from the ape
lineage only 5 million years ago.

“Orangutans share 98 percent of
their genes with humans,” Galdikas
said. “So Rusty isn’t just our cousin,
he’s our brother. Galdikas is particu-
larly interested in the way the orangs
communicate, for they are usually
silent, and rarely encounter each oth-
er. Occasionally a dominant male will
utter his “long call” —— an intermina-

ble, echoing screech that Galdikas
interprets as a simple proclamation
of identity, meaning “Here I am, and
this is who I am.”

But she is convinced the intelli-
gent animals have a large vocabulary
of gestures so subtle they have yet to
be identified. With a video camera
donated by TV producer Norman
Lear -— for whom she worked when
she was a graduate student at UCLA
—- she is now trying to identify and
decipher the gestures.

Galdikas is spending this semes-
ter as a visiting professor at Simon
Fraser University in Vancouver, B.C.,
and came to San Francisco to lecture
at the California Academy of

San Francisco Zoological Society and
the L.S‘.B. Leakey Foundation.

She also checked on the condi-
tion of the orangs at the zoo. And
although zoo director Saul Kitchener
refused to allow her into the animals’
enclosure because he thought they
might harm her, she was delighted at
their activity and obvious health.

“I’ve seen orangs in a lot of zoos,”
she said, “but I’ve never'seen them as
agile and in such obviously good
shape as they are here,” she said.

Keeper John Alkarez explained
that for about two years the youngest
animals were taken from their enclo-
sure for two hours of play in nearby
trees each day, and although that
program has since stopped, Alkarez
h0pes to resume it.

“Swinging freely in real trees
probably taught them how to be the
arboreal animals they really are,”
Galdikas commented. “It’s an innova-
tive idea for 200 animals, and a great
one.”

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - April 12, 1986

Wildlife

 

Day Devoted To Endangered Species

By Peter Hernon
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

The Indiana bat and the Ozark
cave fish aren’t the only wildlife
species endangered in the state.
Don’t forget “lesquerella filifor-
mis” — the Missouri bladder-pod.

The bladder-pod, a member of
the mustard family, is a small
plant. It exists only in three coun-
ties in southwestern Missouri and is
teetering on the edge of extinction.
Unless people intervene, the bright
yellow plant may have no
tomorrow.

And tomorrow, after all, is what
today’s Endangered Species
Awareness Day is about, say ex-
perts such as James H. Wilson, of
the Missouri Department of
Conservation.

With species becoming extinct at
roughly the rate of one a week
throughout the world, the session at
the Missouri Botanical Garden was
meant to draw attention to this loss.

“We are losing things we don’t
even know about. And we have no
way of calculating the loss,” Wilson
said Friday. “The cure for cancer
may be waiting for us in an endan-
gered species.”

The free awareness day session
opens at 9 am. and runs through 5
pm. The subjects to be discussed —
to name but a few — include talks
about “the politics of wolves,” bald
eagle restoration, river otter resto-
ration and “turtles in trouble.”

Wilson said the picture was get-
ting darker for many endangered

 

“We are losing

know about. The

M

species. He cited the steady demise
of the Ozark cave fish. In the 19605,
the small fish was found in roughly
17 sites; today that figure has dwin-
dled to 9.

Missouri’s turtles are also imper-
iled. Of 17 species known to exist in
the state, four are listed as rare or
endangered.

Even a cursory check for wildlife
can lead to striking results. A re-
cent cave biology survey in the
Ozarks revealed at least 25 species
new to science, Wilson said.

“There is no telling what’s out
there, and we could be losing it,” he
said.

Although Wilson admitted that
conservation efforts often end up in
failure, some successes have been
recorded.

The whooping crane, for exam-
ple, has been brought back from 13
birds to a population of nearly 200.
Closer to home, groups like the
Raptor Rehabilitation and Propaga-
tion Project have had successes
with young falcons.

Last summer the group success-

fully raised and released falcons
from the Pet Inc. building in down-
town St. Louis. The barn 0 Vi popu-
lation in the state is also on the rise,
thanks to conservation efforts.

Good news could also be in store
for Missouri’s bald eagles.

At a news conference Friday an-
nouncing the awareness day, an of-
ficial from the Dickerson Park Zoo
revealed that two eagle chicks had
been hatched at the zoo in March.
The zoo, in Springfield, Mo., houses
20 bald eagles. The coliection is re-
ported the iargest captive popula-
tion of these birds in the world.

The aim is to get the 'eagles to
nest in Missouri again, said Joe
Carrier, a zoo official. .

Carrier brought an eagle named
Omega to the botanical garden.
Omega, 3 17-year-old eagle with a
wingspan of well over six feet and a
willingness to have her picture tak-

- en, was clearly a hit at the news

conference. There’s a lot of ham in
that bird.

Omega was treated years ago for.
lead poisoning. After a strong re-
covery, she has appeared at dozens
of exhibitions and has even been
displayed at the White House. She
is too accustomed to humans to sur-
vive on her own, said Carrier.

The two young eagles were
hatched by chickens who practiced
for the ordeal by sitting on dumm
eggs. .

When it comes to wildlife preser-
vation, sometimes it does pay to
trick Mother Nature.

The Minneapolis couple hated leaving their

After ﬁnding that Chopin preferred staying at a
neighbor’s house, the Sanders-Greenbergs hit
upon a great idea: Pets Are Inn, a boarding
service that places pets in private homes instead
of kennels. ‘

That was three years ago. And today, says
Harry Sanders-Greenberg, more than half of the
animal-loving caretakers are retirees.

wouldn’t want another dog because they liked the

Feline fans. “We’ve always been interested in
pets, particularly cats,” says 59-year-old Ione
Haller, who with her husband, John, 60, has
worked for Pets Are Inn for two years. “We
really enjoy it. When the time comes, it’s a little
hard to see the cats go because you get fond of
them. But we know we can go back to doing other
things. If we want to go away for a few days, we
can do that.”

‘ ‘I’ve had little dogs before and I didn’t want
[to own] another dog for myself,” says Mildred
Fox, 3 Pets Are Inn caretaker in her early 80s. “I
can be nice to someone else’s pets. It doesn’t
take long to be friends with them.”

Last year, Pets Are Inn placed 1,500 animals in
Minneapolis-St. Paul homes. Some 75 caretakers
service Minneapolis pet owners, and about the
same number operate in St. Paul, where
Sanders-Greenberg sold a franchise last year. He
hopes to sell additional franchises in Milwaukee,
Kansas City, Des Moines, Iowa, Cincinnati , and,
eventually, the rest of the country.

The Sanders-Greenbergs provide pickup and
delivery of the pets, as well as food. The
caretakers feed and exercise the pets and make
them feel at home. Most of the clients own cats
and dogs, but an occasional bird or snake is not
out of the ordinary. Caretakers with experience
working in pet stores are on hand to care for such '
pets.

Prices for the pet owners are $7.50 per day for
cats, and $10.50 to $12.50 per day for dogs,
depending on the dogs’ size. There is an
additional transportation fee. The caretakers earn
$3.50 per day for cats and $5 to $6 per day for
dogs.

Pet pals. Pets and caretakers are matched
anonymously, to prevent pet owners from
“dogging” the caretakers, says
Sanders-Greenberg, but the owners can write a
letter to the caretaker with detailed instructions.

the young mammals escaped through

the approaching Sidewinder.

Those early wildlife sagas can, per-

HOUSTON CHRONICLE - April 19, 1986

John Tveten

Dinstinctive because of its enormous ears, this pinyon mouse was
live-trapped in Colorado and photographed in a habitat constructed
with rocks and branches from the capture site.

Captive animals are introduced and
then filmed as they interacted.

To some, this may seem unfair. And
many amateur photographers prefer to
take pictures only in wild settings. In-
deed, many wildlife photography con-
tests are limited only to natural events}
and unrestrained creatures. For the
professional who must obtain a specific
sequence, on schedule and within the

budget, however, this is frequently im-
possible.

Even in my own photography, I am
limited by time and Opportunity. For a
series of books, I am attempting to film
every Texas mammal, including every
obscure species of mouse and every
bat, some of which are very rare.
Sometimes I am lucky and get the pic-
tures in the wild, but others are almost

 




impossible to approach. The only real-
istic solution is to live-trap them and
photograph them in an appropriate set-
ting. More than one such animal has
been photographed with ﬂash in a mo-
tel bathroom, carefully surrounded by
sand and rocks and plants from its nat-
ural environment.

Similarly, I am recording the life cy-
cles of various moths and butterflies.
When I find a chrysalis or cocoon of a
particular species I need, I do not pho-
tograph it and leave, naively h0ping to
return later to find the adult emerging.
The remainder of the sequence takes
place on my kitchen cupboard.

With such setups, of course, there is
an attendant responsibility to repre-
sent the facts. The photographer must
be careful to select the proper environ-
ment, knowing which behavior is nor-
mal and appropriate. I would-not, for
example, photograph a pocket mouse
from West Texas among the leaves
from an East Texas willow oak.

. The results of good laboratory film-

making can be incredibly effective. I ‘

recently watched a TV program on
carnivorous plants, actually witnessing
tiny insects being trapped by a blad-
derwort or sliding irrevocably down
into the throat of a pitcher plant. I
knew there was no tiny cameraman at
the bottom of the bog, looking into the
pitcher plant with an equally tiny cam-
era. But the film represented reality,
and I learned a great deal.

In the April issue of National Geo-
graphic, bat expert Merlin Tuttle
writes about fruit bats, “Gentle Fliers
of the African Night.” The accompany-
ing photographs are magnificent.
Tuttle details how some of the pictures
were obtained. A hotel room was
cleared of furniture, heavy plastic
placed on the floor, and camera gear
installed in a screened enclosure. Even
with captive animals, one can only
marvel at Tuttle’s perseverance.

“My captive bats proved gentle and
inquisitive, yet even in a controlled set-
ting, success always came hard. For
nearly a month I virtually lived with
my bats, sometimes working for six
hours preparing for a single shot, then
frequently waiting all night — often in
vain — for my subjects to perform.”

With such patience are wildlife films
made.

Frisky the ferret stirs

Carson City

By CY RYAN
United Press International

CARSON CITY -— A ferret
named Frisky, who has set off a
constitutional battle, was ordered
freed from city custody this week
by a judge who says he’s in a
“Catch 22 situation.”

Justice of the Peace John Ray
directed Frisky be released from
the city’s animal control center
and be returned to its owners,
Thelbert and Tanya Cordingly,
who are accused of violating a
newly enacted ordinance that pro-
hibits ferrets being kept in homes
where there are children less than
3 years old.

However, the judge said the
Cordinglys must obey the or-
dinance that the animal not be
kept in the home with their 11-
month-old baby.

“We’re not seeking to put
Frisky behind bars for the rest of
his life,” Deputy District Attorney
Charles Cockerill said.

He urged the judge to release
the ferret from the animal com-
plex but also said the parents
should find another place, possibi-
ly the home of a friend, to keep the
animal, pending the outcome of
the case.

Cockerill said the animal
should not be allowed to stay in
the home because the city might

legal fight

face liability if the child was
harmed.

Edward Bernard, lawyer
representing the Cordinglys, said
Frisky “was a loving animal” and
is not a danger to the child. He
asked the ferret be allowed to
return to the home until the trial.

The Carson City Board of
Supervisors earlier this year
enacted an ordinance restricting
ownership after hearing about
cases where ferrets have severely
mauled young children. Bernard
argued the ordinance is un-
constitutional and Judge Ray set
May 21 for a hearing on the issue.

Bernard suggests the city il-
legally seized the ferret before the
validity of the ordinance could be
tested. He noted the Cordinglys
had the ferret for 18 months while
the child was born only 11 months
ago.

Bernard declined to say
whether Frisky would be farmed
out to another family until the
constitutionality of the law was
decided. He said he wanted to
discuss the case with the Cord-
inglys before they take steps.

Thelbert Cordingly suggested
it was a neighbor who called the
sheriff’s department to report the
ferret in the home.

“Frisky’s never been a pro-
blem,” he said.

TOLEDO (AP) -— An exhibit dedi-
cated to the memory of a 5-year-old
victim of child abuse is to open Thurs-
day at the Toledo Zoo. The Magic For-
est commemorates Matthew Catlett,
who died in February 1980 after being
beaten, kicked and scalded by two
men and a teen-ager living in his
mother’s apartment.

. ' The boy’s death and his burial in a
pauper’s grave sparked outrage and a
flood of contributions. The Family and
Child Abuse Prevention Center,
trustee for the money, used about
$5,000 to print booklets on choosing
child care and preventing child abuse.

With the $700 left over, “We wanted
something concrete that would benefit
a large portion of the community,”
said Linda Heineman, executive direc-
tor of the center.

The exhibit demonstrates that fami-
lies can be helped, that abuse doesn’t
have to happen, Heineman said. “It’s
an acknowledgment of the problem
and the positive approach, that you

can get help so that it doesn’t hap- .

pen.

A plaque with Matthew’s name and
the inscription. “It should be fun to be
‘a child." will be mounted in the Magic

Forest, which will include live and

stuffed animals living among trees,
logs and burrows.

Matthew lived above a closed tav-
ern in a four-room apartment in
Toledo with his mother, Marjorie; his
sister. Angel; Gregory Solly and his
ex-wife, Paula; and Phillip Jovano-
vich.

The beatings began shortly after
the Catletts moved in and lasted for
several weeks, testimony in Lucas
County Common Pleas Court
revealed. Jovanovich beat the boy
because he disliked the boy’s father,
according to trial records.

Testimony indicated Solly and
J ovanovich competed to see who could
hit Matthew the hardest or kick him
the farthest. Matthew’s mother did
nothing to st0p the abuse, according to
the judge who heard the woman’s
case.

Solly and Jovanovich were found
guilty of murder and sentenced to 15
years to life in prison. Solly’s former
brother-in-law, Mark Mitruk, then 16,
who sometimes lived in the apart-
ment, pleaded guilty to involuntary
manslaughter and was sentenced to
six to 25 years in prison.

Marjorie Catlett was found guilty of
endangering children and was sen-

 

 

tenced to one to five years in prison,
and Paula Solly, who pleaded guilty to
failing to report a crime, was sen-
tenced to 30 days in jail.

Angel, now 13, has been adopted.
Although she was not physically
abused, she was a victim, and “has
been through thousands of dollars of
psychotherapy,” Heineman said.

Heineman saidthe abuse Matthew
suffered was never reported to child

_ welfare officials. But there is a grow-

ing movement toward rEporting
abuse.

“The trend we’ve seen is that over
the last 10 years, pe0p1e have become
more willing to be aware of what’s
going on around them,” she said.

“There was a strong attitude that a
family’s business was its own business
and you don’t get involved. PeOple
have realized they have a responsibil-
ity to protect children.”

Elephant dung can be garden’s delight

By MIKE KLINGAMAN
The Baltimore Evening Sun

Bob Starrett has never seen the circus, but he
has The Big Top in his blood. More accurately,
he will have The Big Top in his blood when he
bites into his first homegrown tomato this
summer.

Starrett’s garden in northeast Baltimore is
slathered in elephant manure. It is as if Dumbo
spent the night tethered there. He didn’t, of
course. The pachyderm poo came from the cir—
cus, which held a manure giveaway outside of
the elephant tent on Monday, midway through
its two—week run at the Civic Center.

Starrett and his wife, Virginia, brought 15
plastic trash bags in a 1980 Ford station wagon.
Stan Lattimore and George Mooney, neighbors
from northwest Baltimore, brought a pickup
truck.

All of them left happy. They left 30 cubic feet
of manure behind, too. In the lunch hour pre-
scribed for the giveaway, only four people came
forward to worship the ground that the ele~
phants stood on. This is an alarming statistic,
even in a Democratic stronghold such as
Baltimore.

I expected a bigger turnout, because of the

shortage of farm manure for city homeowners.
Are there so few organic gardeners in my
hometown? An elephant chip the size of a bas-
ketball could feed a tomato plant all summer,
and the herd of 20 inside the tent-goddesses of
garden fertility produced a wheelbarrow full of
the stuff every 45 minutes.

Most of the elephant dung was hauled to a
Baltimore landfill. What a perfect waste of
waste.

“We say elephant manure grows the biggest
tomatoes, zebra manure gives you striped vege-
tables, and camel manure lets your plants go
for weeks without water,” said Mike Melssen,
assistant general manager of Ringling Bros. and
Barnum & Bailey Circus. He ﬁgures elephant
manure is the best because “elephants have
about worst digestive system in the world.

So much of what comes out is raw.”

The manure giveaway is a bigger hit in other
towns. There were 15 cars and trucks lined up
in Oklahoma City two years ago. In New York
City, says Rick Lurty, “people were actually ar-
guing about who was to get the next bucketful.”

Lurty helps gardeners load manure into box-
es, bags, pails and trucks. In Phoenix, he put a
bagful in the trunk of a well-dressed couple’s
car. The man wore a three-piece suit; the lady, a
mink coat. “They wanted me to go home with
them and lift it out of the car for them,” said
Lurty.

“In New York, I’ve seen little old. ladies car—
rying little bags of it home on the subway for

their window boxes,” said Melssen. Undoubted- '

1y, none of them was mugged. .

The Starretts, who are retired, wanted ma—
nure for their raised—bed gardens. “My husband
wanted this so badly he came on his golf day,”
said Virginia Starrett, holding a plastic bag

open for Bob’s pitchfork.

They filled their wagon and backed into the
street. “I better not put on the brakes too fast,

driving home,” said Bob.

Lurty wished them a safe trip. “Can you
imagine having an accident on the Beltway

with a load of manure?” he said.

Polar bears find home in Albuquerque

By The Associated Press

ALBUQUERQUE -— The Rio
Grande Zoo will soon be home to
the most famous visitors to the
town dump in the Canadian harbor
village of Churchill, Manitoba.

Linda, a 400-pound polar bear,
and her l4-month-old cub, are en-
route to the Albuquerque zoo. They
began the 2,500-mile journey
Thursday by rail, but will be trans-
ported most of the way by truck.

The 20-yeareold Linda and her
cub became well known in Church-
ill because of their frequent visits

to the town’s dump. When they left

Thursday, a small group of towns-
people joined wildlife officials and
a delegation from Albuquerque in
seeing them off.

“So old Linda’s finally going to
have a home,” commented one of
the local residents.

The campaign to get Linda and
her cub from Canada to Al-
buquerque involved the efforts of
the Rio Grande Zoo, the A1-
buquerque Journal and even Sen.
Pete Domenici, R-N.M.

The Albuquerque newspaper as
sumed the transportation costs for
the two bears and Domenici inter—

vened with the US. Fish and Wild-
life Service when it appeared the
process for getting the bears to A1-
buquerque would stall.

The bears were captured last
fall and made available for adop
tion under wildlife management
policies applicable in the Churchill .
area.

The Rio Grande Zoo began
trying to obtain the bears after its
only polar bear, Major, developed
kidney failure and was put to sleep.
Zoo officials said they hepe to have
Linda and her cub on exhibit later
this month.

Dear Mr s. Yarbrough:

Thank you for your recent inquiry on the vessel
A. gigging, which is grounded off the coast of Mona
Island near Puerto Rico. My office has been working
with several Federal agencies to determine the best
course of action to pursue in this matter. Concerns
have been expressed by numerous individuals that the
vessel and its contents pose a significant threat to
the coral reef it rests on and to several species of
sea turtles located in the area.

In the interest of determining the facts, a team
including personnel from the Army Corps of Engineers,
Coast Guard, Navy Superintendent of Salvage, and
Puerto Rico's Department. of Natural. Resources
inspected the vessel in late January. The team reports
raised questions concerning the threat to the
endangered species and the damage that could be caused
to the habitat and turtles in removing the A; Eggigg.
Additionally, their estimate of the costs of removal
operations is much higher than we had anticipated
earlier.

In light‘ of the above, I have asked the
Department of Interior and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration to analyze the alternative
strategies presented in the reports. This effort is
presently under way, and we hope to have the results
shortly. Upon completion of this analysis, the
involved Federal agencies will meet. to review the
conclusions and determine what should be done next.
Thank you for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

5%. 9/7., 46%?

BOSTON GLOBE - April 9, 1986

I wish to respond to a recent
column by David Wilson. “Tax
J revenue lost in the swamp," on
:4 the proposed mall in south Attle-
boro, which the Environmental
Protection Agency has rejected be—
cause it involves filling Sweedens
Swamp, a local wetland.

In terming the area a “surplus
wetland,” Wilson reveals his fun-
damental misunderstanding of
the issue. There are no “surplus
wetlands" in the United States.
We’ve been systematically de-
stroying them at a rate of 300,000
acres per year. Of the approxi-
mately 215 million acres that once
existed in the lower 48 states, less
than half remain.

:. Wetlands provide vital habitat
. for migratorywaterfowl and'nu-
merous other wildlife and fish Spe-
cies. They serve as buffers from
erosion and recharge and purify
water supplies. In short, these eco-
systems provide some of the most
productive land areas in our na-x
tion.

Everyone agrees that wetlands
have great value, but when tough
decisions must be made to protect
them, policy makers often suc-
cumb to development pressures.
. In the case of the south Attleboro
mall, the regional EPA adminis-
trator, Michael Deland, did not
succumb to that pressure. In-

Wetlands must be protected from developers

stead, he merely enforCed federal
law — Section 404 program of the
Clear Water Act - which was
passed to protect these areas from
the never-ending demands of de-
velopers.

Despite the repeated efforts of
the Army Corps of Engineers to
ride roughshod over the law, feder-
al courts have consistently upheld
theintent of Congress that these
areas be preserved.

Wilson may have scored some
points with his flippant remarks
about wetlands protection, but he
missed the real point - any deci-
sion to go forward with this mall
would overturn the ”water—depen—
dency" rule in the wetlands pro-
tection program.

That rule, which is the heart of
the program, states that projects -—
like shopping malls —- should not
be located in waters. With that
rule out of the way. a precedent
would be established when alter-
natives are available (another site
is available in Massachusetts only
three miles away), giving develops
ers the green light to fill wetlands
across the nation. There is much
more at stake here than the 50
acres of Sweedens Swamp.

, In this sesquicentennial year,
the vision of Texas as a huge
land with limitless opportunities
and space for everyone and their
dreams is being floated befbre us
again. But for Texas wildlife, the
, vision is a false one, as wild creae
tures struggle to survive in a
shrinking world where eventual
extinction is a real possibility.
Oil, gas and mining interests,
real estate developers, federal
and state government agencies,
and you and I are intruding fur-
, ther and further into their-dimin-
ishing territories.

Since 1835, we have gained
Texas from Mexico, but we have
lost the Passenger Pigeon, the
Carolina Parakeet, the Red Wolf,
California Condor, and Ivory
billed Woodpecker. Just for start-

ers. We nearly lost the Whooping

Crane, Ocelot, Bald Eagle, vari
, ous Prairie Chickens, Texas Wild
Rice, Peregrine Falcon, and
Brown Pelican, just to mention a
~~few. Others, such as migratory
. ducks and shorebirds, are in
what Baylor University biologist
' Fred Gehlbach describes as a
state of unnatural decline. To the
extent that Texas allows any
wildlife species to disappear, our
lives are immeasurably

One of two remaining vireo colo-

pressure as Austin expands to
the west, but Austin has proved
sensitive to such issues in the
past, and the vireo may receive
there the protection that it
deserves.

The decline of wildlife is a
global crisis, the result of an ex-
panding human population. Russ

the world’s 200 primate species

levels of hunting and tropical
rainforest destruction continue.

Man is a destructive predator,
whether in Texas, Africa or
South America. Only one per-
cent of Brazil’s coastal rain forest

why should we bother to save
them, or to save Black-capped

of awareness of this issue is re—

The picture seems a gloomy
one, but while unthinking and
sometimes deliberate human fol-

lies have led to the unfolding
tragedy, human enterprise has
sought and sometimes succeeded
in reversing the trend to extinc~

Tamarin monkey has become a
symbol for wildlife conservation,
with enthusiastic support from
the people, and recent successes
in captive breeding have resulted
in a program to reintroduce it to

Never lacking for resourceful-
ness, landowners have enthusias-
tically accepted invitations from
the Texas Nature Conservancy to
become stewards for the preser-
vation of critical ecosystems
identified on their property

gram seeks to identify all critical
ecosystems in the state, and to
initiate measures to acquire or
otherwise protect them. It will
beneﬁt all threatened and en-
dangered species, and hence all
of the state’s wildlife.

Similar resourcefulness is un-
der way in an educational aware-
ness program in schools. Some
serious political pressure may
have to be applied on the State
Legislature, however, if mean- 1
ingful results are to be seen be-
fore it is too late.

Progress putting squeeze
on the Florida pine snake

GAINESVILLE (AP) -- The
Florida pine snake, a constrictor
that chokes its victims to death with
powerful coils, is being squeezed out
of its own habitat by an even more
aggressive competitor -—— urban
development, researchers say.

According to a University of
Florida herpetologist, the develop-
ment of Florida’s previously undis-
turbed sandhills may prove perilous
to the harmless, non-poisonous
snake, which is already listed as a
Species of Special Concern.

“Twenty years ago, no one in his
right mind would think about living
in these upland sandhills,” said Dick
Franz, a researcher at UPS Florida
,State Museum. “But now that much
of the waterfront land and other
prirrie sites have been developed,
people are buying and building on
property in these less favorable
areas.”

A Species of Special Concern, as
defined by the Florida Game and
Fresh Water Fish Commission, war-
rants special protection because its
population is in danger of declining.
If the species becomes threatened, it
can also adversely affect associated
species.

Pine snakes are quite fond of '

central Florida’s scrubby sandhills,
according to Franz, who tracked the

daily movements of a number of the
reptiles by radio at the university’s
9,200-acre Katharine Ordway Pre-
serve. ‘

which are native to Florida, like to
use the burrows created by pocket
gophers living in the sandhills.

“Florida pine snakes are depend-
ent on the underground holes and
cavities created by the pocket go-
pher to escape certain predators and
the extremes in temperatures that
prevail in the sandhill environ-
ment,” Franz siad.

Pine snakes hide in these tunnels
whenever their skin sheds, which
may be as often as three or four
times a year. It takes seven to 23
days for the snake to slough its old
skin.

“In the meantime, the animal’s
eyes cloud over as fluid forms be-
tween the new and old skin,” Franz
said. “They can see only shadows
outlined by light, and they’re vulner-
able to predators if they’re on the
surface during that time.”

But the pocket gophers also are
being threatened by the encroaching
urban environment. If the gophers
disappear, however, so will the bur-
rows the pine snakes use as hiding

- places.

Pet cemeteries: Only the best

By LISA POPE
Staff writer

The end of a pet’s life isn’t what
it used to be.

Among today’s pet memorial op-
tions are lace- and satin-trimmed
caskets, space-age plastic burial re-
cepticles and marble headstones
engraved with poetic epitaphs such
as, “Googie: You’re with us
always.”

“This pet thing is here to stay,”
said Tom Lawton, president of the

International Association of Pet
Cemeteries holding its convention
this week at the Lincoln Hotel in
North Dallas. “The relationship of
pets with pet owners has changed
in the last 30 years. Animals used
to be functional. Now they’re in
bed with us.”

Industry experts say that change
in attitude has generated an un-
precedented demand for pet buri-
als. The association has responded
by creating industry standards that
are the prime topic of discussion

among the more than 50 pet ceme-
tery operators in Dallas this week.
The new standards ——- also adopt—
ed by the two leading veterinary
associations this year -— call for
permanent care funds for the pets
and providing cemetery perpetuity.

“Some of us get more Visitors
than human cemeteries on Memo-
rial Days,” said Lawton, operator
of Pines Pet Cemetery in Ohio,
where more than 10,000 dogs, cats,
ferrets, lizards, horses and other

Lawton estimates that there are
more than 500 pet cemeteries in
the United States. Because the in-
dustry is largely unregulated, he
believes the new standards will im-
prove the business.

“Our industry will go through
the same problems human ceme-
teries did,” he said. “What we’re
doing is we’re anticipating the
problems and we’re going to set
ourselves above that.”

Many of the workshops at the
convention concern pet cemetery

management and perpetuity. The ’

goal is to keep the pets out of land-
ﬁlls and rendering plants.

“The bottom line is, it’s your pet
and it’s your responsibility,” said
Lawton.

The cemetery operators also will
consider the emotional aspects of
their business. They will hear
counselors and psychologists talk
about how to help masters deal
with, their grief over the loss of a
pet.

“I see people walking by here

who see our sign and say, ‘Oh
gosh’ and laugh. But when their
pet dies it’s a whole different
thing,” said Dr. Wendell C. Morse,
a veterinarian and executive direc-
tor of the association.

“Years ago people were afraid to
express their true emotions,” he
said. “But we’ve seen a terriﬁc in-
crease in the human/animal com-
panion bond. It’s had a tremendous
impact on the way people think of
their pet after death.

“It’s an emotional time.”

Sea World Trainer Friend to Killer Whales

By DAVID
and
LINDA PHILLIPS

F YOU have ever seen the killer

whales, dolphins and other animals

at Sea World perform, you must

have wondered how they were
taught to interact so well with their
human trainers. '

The modern training methods were
introduced by David Butcher, now cor-
porate direc-
tor of animal
behavior for
the whole of
. Sea World.
Based in Orlando, Fla., Butcher man-
ages about 75 trainers at the various Sea
World locations and oversees the train-
ing of all the marine animals.

Thirteen years ago Butcher, then the
youngest Sea World trainer, volunteered
to work with the killer whales. The
whales were aggressive and hard to deal

with. Several of the earlier trainers quit.-

“They would try to bite us,” says Butch-
er, recalling the time when he was
dragged to the‘bottom of the pool and sat
on by one of the whales.

THIS WAS a turning point for him and
for the training of marine animals. “It
was either get out of the business or ﬁnd
a better way to do it,” Butcher explains.

The training system at the time was to
give the animals food every time they
did what they were supposed to do. The
method was obViously not successful as
the animals remained aggressive and
dangerous.

Butcher found a different method. The
new technique involved letting the ani-
mals know when they were behaving
well and shunning them when they were
acting inappropriately. The reward
would consist of affection or a rubdoizvn,

u.

maybe a toy or some playtime with a
trainer. They were given as much food
as they wanted. Butcher found that the
animals responded favorably to variety

and change in their environment.

“Our whole training program revolves
around variety,” Butcher says. “We
bring attention to good behavior and we

' —-Photo by Steve ‘Szerdy

ignore improper behavior.”

Within a year of implementing the new
method, positive results were obvious.
The trainers were in the water with the
killer whales and even going for rides on
their backs.

“The whales began to perform beha-
viors because of the relationship, not the
food,” Butcher explains.

This relationship between man and
animal becomes clear when you watch a
program at Sea World.

“Our whole training program at Sea
World is to establish a presentation
through which the public can come and
observe an interaction between man and
the animal kingdom,” says Butcher.

Butcher wasn’t happy to just teach the
animals some tricks so they could per-
form for the public. He had other
motives. -

“I’m a strong animal lover,” he says.
“I wanted to believe morally that what I

- was doing with these animals was cor-

rect and I didn’t feel it was when I was
giving them their ration of food for hav-
ing them learn a trick. So when I got ina
position of responsibility I changed
that.”

A TESTIMONY to the success of his
methods was the birth of a killer whale
named Baby Shamu last year. It was the
first-ever successful birth of a killer
whale in captivity. Butcher and his train-
ers have helped provide an environment
safe enough for these animals to repro-
duce in captivity.

What about the future? “Ihad a dream
in the 19705 that I would like to be part of
a movement to help find a way that we
could break down the barrier of commu-
nication between man and the animal
kingdom,” he says. “And I think we’re
starting to approach that.”

Drilling Rights

g
on North Coast 01'] drilling

 

BY Malt Pennock Jr./Tbe Tribune

By Carol Benfell
The Tribune

A public hearing on Depart—
ment of Interior plans to lease
Northern California coastal
waters for oil drilling will be
held in San Francisco on
Tuesday.

Environmental, fishing and
other concerned groups have
bitterly attacked the prepos-
al, which would allow off-
shore develOpment along vir—
tually the entire California
coast by 1989.

Interior Secretary Donald
Hodel opened the coast to
“notices of interest” from oil
developers in February after
Congress refused to renew a
four-year moratorium on Cal-
ifornia offshore oil drilling.

Hodel said offshore devel~
opment is necessary to ease
U.S. reliance on foreign coun-
tries for oil and to reduce the
balance of trade deficit.

The California congression-
al delegation, which had been
negotiating with Hodel to
reach mutually satisfactory
drilling arrangements, ac-
cused the secretary of delib-
erately sabotaging the talks.

A draft environmental im-
pact report prepared by the
department to justify off-
shore oil drilling in California
has drawn fire from environ-

would allow drilling within
three miles of the scenic Men~
docino Coast, up to the bound-
aries of the Farallon Islands
National Marine Sanctuary
and within three miles of
Point Ano Nuevo, one of the
largest breeding grounds of
elephant seals on the Pacific
Coast.

Oil Spills, leaks and routine
discharges from drilling
would threaten the survival of
waterfowl, fish and other sea
creatures living in drilling
areas, environmentalists say.

The draft EIR has also
raised concerns among sport
and commercial fishermen
who fearfish kills from oil
spills. The proposal allows
drilling immediately adjacent
to Cordell Bank, one of the
best and largest fisheries on
the Northern California coast.

Residents along the coast of
Mendocino and Humboldt
counties are also opposing the
department‘s plan, citing fear
of oil spills like those that
have polluted beaches and
killed thousands of shellfish in
Southern California.

one scheduled for Northern
California, begins at 8:30 am.

CHICAGO TRIBUNE - April 6, 1986

City no place for a squirrel? You must be
nuts

By Michael Arndt

The squirrel was brought in sever-
al months back, thin and weak. The
staff of the Willowbrook Wildlife
Rehabilitation Center—an emergen—
cy room of sorts for the injured, the
ill and the infants of Du Page
County’s animal kingdom—did
what it could, placing the squirrel in
a special .medical ward, where it was
fed a glucose mixture and its condi-
tion was regularly monitored.

Forty-eight hours later, however,
the creature was dead. An autopsy
was ordered.

The ﬁndings surprised all. Despite
the feedings, the squirrel had
starved to death, its stomach clog-
ged by a wad of Juicy Fruit gum.
“How did we know it was Juicy
Fruit?” asks Lou Strobhar, whose
duties at the seven-employee facility
go far beyond her secretary-recep-
tionist job title. “The odor was still
very fresh. It was unmistakably
Juicy Fruit.”

The animal was one of the 200 to
300 tree squirrels the rehabilitation
center in west suburban Glen Ellyn
takes in every year to nurse back to
health for release later in the‘wild.
The figure, which represents only
those animals dropped off by the
caring public, is but one indication
of the magnitude of Illinois’ tree
squirrel population.

_Another, more surprising indica-
tion is this: The Illinois Conserva—
tion Department estimates that in
recent years Illinois hunters have
killed 1.75 million tree squirrels in
each fall hunting season.

Moreover, naturalists point out

“The squirrel’s habitat’s there,”
says Lonnie Hansen, a forest wild—
life ecologist with the Illinois Natu-
ral History Survey. “There are trees.
There is food.”

.Nor, naturalists say, have squirrel
predators been able to adjust to
urban life.

Jim Creighton agrees. Creighton
is one of two animal control offi-
cers in Chicago assigned full time to
handle complaints regarding wild-

life. “During the colder weather, we

are inundated with squirrel calls,

squirrels in the basement or
squirrels 1n the attic or squ1rrels

trying to get in the house,”

Creighton says. “They are No. 1 on

the list.”

Adored by nature lovers and
anthropomorphized by cartoonists
into cute, chipper characters,
squirrels are also vilified as vermin,.
especially by “bird people” who
have seen their feeders cleaned out
by squirrels in a matter of minutes.

“Essentially, they’re rats with
fuzzy tails,” says Mark Spreyer, a
research coordinator for the Chica—
go Academy of Sciences, who says
he has taken his share of squirrel
calls, too. .

There are 275 species of squirrels
in the world, on all continents ex-
cept Australia and Antarctica.
Squirrels—the name is derived from
two Greek words meaning “shadow
tail”—-—range in size from the Afri-
can pygmy squirrel, which weighs

‘about half an ounce, to the mar-

mot, which can. weigh as much as
20 pounds

In Illinois, there are ground

. squirrels, ﬂying squirrels and three
.- specres of tree squirrel: the gray, the

fox and the red. Red squirrels,

* which once ranged across much of
; the northern part of the state, are
now found only along the banks of

the Kankakee River, according to

' Hansen. In the Chicago area, Han-

sen says, there are gray and fox
squrrrels. The gray squirrel
predominates.

The black squirrels seen in some
neighborhoods are actually a
“phase” of gray squirrels, naturalists
sav.

Tree squirrels are diurnal, which
means they are awake during day-
light. They do not hibernate, al—
though they may hole up for days

 

that the “harvest,” which excludes
such squirrel—rich territory as metro-
politan Chicago, has had no appre-
ciable effect on the number of the
animals, even in the most heavily
shot—up woods. .

No one can‘ say with certainty
just how many tree squirrels there
are in Illinois, but the number prob-
ably reaches into the tens of mil-
lions. As anyone in the Chicago
area knows, their environment is
not limited to Downstate forests. In
fact, naturalists say the tree squirrel
has adapted to city life better than
almost any other indigenous mam-
mal.

“Many of the most familiar
creatures we See today .[in cities]
were introduced,” says Bruce
Patterson, associate curator of
mammals at the Field Museum of
Natural History. “House mice;
Norway rats, or sewerrats; roof
rats; house sparrows; pigeons. They
were all introduced from Europe.”

Keeper Donna Klein feeds a four—week-old baby squirrel oatmeal at
the Willowbrook Wildlife Rehabilitation Center. Each year, the Glen
Ellyn facility nurses 200 to 300 tree squirrels back to health.

 




at a time during the winter.

Wild squirrels live about two
years. Those in captivity, though,
have been knOWn to live three times
as long. The shorter lifespan in the
'wild is due largely to predators,
which include owls, hawks, foxes,
dogs and bobcats. .

Naturalists say squirrels are not
strict vegetarians; their diet consists
mostly of nuts and seeds, but
squirrels also eat insects and‘ canon.
“Citiﬁed” squirrels—as the Wil-
lowbrook squirrel showed—ingest
much, much more, however.

“If he can’t ﬁnd any acorns. or
hickory nuts or chestnuts, he might
take anything he can ﬁnd in a gar—
bage can,” says Mark Tuttle, man—
ager of the conservation depart—
ment’s Chicago ofﬁce.”

Carl Strang, a Willowbrook natu»

ralist, gives this advice to homeown-
ers who discover a squirrel nesting
in the attic: Turn on lights and
make noise by, say, leaving a radio
playing. Dousing the area With am-
monia helps. Others tout mothballs.
“Remove the features of quiet and
darkness that made it attractive in
the ﬁrst place,” he says. _

Spreyer at the Academy of Scr-
ences tells those who want to re-
strict their birdfeeders to. intended
guests: “Get a dog and tie him up
out there.” If that doesn’t work, he
shrugs, you may as well give up.
Placing rubber snakes or owls near-
by, greasing guy wires and poles
and trapping work only temporari-
ly, he says.

“Squirrels seem to be adapted to
urban life very well,” Spreyer says.
“It’s a losing battle.”

Fears and phobias
might be inherited

- A child may inherit more from
his parents than his mother’s blue
eyes and his father’s broad
shoulders. Phobias and fears may
also be part of the family heritage,
researchers at two different centers
report. Dr. Russell Noyes Jr. and
colleagues at the University of Iowa
found that agoraphobia, the fear of
leaving home for open spaces, runs
in families. Reporting in the Ar—
chives of General Psychiatry, Noyes
noted that relatives of agoraphobics
ran a signiﬁcant risk for that phobia
and for alcoholism. Michael Cook,
a psychologist at the University of
Wisconsin, has conducted experi-
ments suggesting that inherited pho-
bias are to some extent a case of
“monkey see, monkey do.” In the
Wisconsin experiments, Cook used
Rhesus monkeys reared in the wild
who had a fear of snakes and their
offspring, reared in captivity, who
didn’t. After the younger monkeys
wereallowed to observe their
parents’ reaction to snakes, they ac-
quired the phobia themselves.
Young monkeys ﬁrst exposed to
older monkeys who behaved with-
out fear of snakes didn’t acquire a
snake phobia, even after watching
phobic monkeys later. The tech-
nique had limitations for Cook who
was unable to instill a fear of
flowers in young monkeys by
showing them ﬁlms of monkeys
who appeared to have such a fear.

quire their parents’ phobias.

Aquarium Constructing a New Complex

 

By WILLIAM G. BLAIR

The New York Aquarium has begun
building a $6.5 million educational ex-
hibition complex known as Discovery
Cove, the first of a series of projects
aimed at giving the public “a real feel
for the aquatic environment."

The effort comes in the 10th year that
Dr. George D. Ruggieri has served as
director of the aquarium, which
stretches along the Coney Island board-
walk at West 8th Street in Brooklyn.

For Dr. Ruggieri, who is both a ma-
rine biologist and a Jesuit priest, Dis-
Covery Cove is the first of three ele-
ments needed to achieve “a complete
aquarium” over the next decade.

“The aquarium should give the pub-
lic a real feel for the aquatic environ-
ment in the same sense that the Bronx
Zoo does with animals,” Dr. Ruggieri
said.

To Open in 2 Years

Discovery Cove is scheduled to open
in the spring of 1988. Its cost will be
shared equally by the city and private
philanthropy. .

The development represents a new

 

 

approach to the exhibition of marine

life, Dr. Ruggieri said.

The Discovery Cove building on the
14-acre aquarium site will be divided
into four principal areas dealing with
the properties of sand and water,
coastal ecosystems, the adaptations of
marine animals and the relationship of
people to the sea.

All this will be portrayed through live
animals, dioramas, graphic and photo-
graphic displays, push-button demon-
strations and participatory exhibits in-
tended to engage a visitor in the watery
world that is home to the smallest in-

vertebrates and the largest mammals. ‘

000,000 Visitors ~ -.

Dr. Ruggieri presides over more,
than 22,400 aquatic creatures — 20,000
of them corals and anemones -— at the
aquarium, a division of the New York
Zoological Society. Last year, the
aquarium attracted 600,000 visitors; its
current operating budget is $4 million.

Twenty years ago, the operating
budget was $700,000 and the aquarium
housed more than 2,500 sea organisms,
about 1,000 of them corals and anem-

 

 

ones.

“We haveno problem about multi-
plying fishes,” Dr. Ruggieri observed
during an interview in his office.

By the end of the year, he said, the
second capital-improvement project is
expected to get under way. It will be
called Sea Cliffs and will cost
$15 million. It should be finished by the
spring of 1989, he said.

Whale Habitat Planned

Sea Cliffs, an indoor-outdoo'r se-
quence of coastal habitats for seals,
walruses, penguins and sea otters, will
stretch 350 feet along the fence separat-
ing the aquarium from the boardwalk.
Unlike the present grouping of pools,
Sea Cliffs will provide underwater
viewing of mammals and birds.

The third development project, a
$30 million whale-dolphin habitat, has
not yet been designed and is five to
eight years away, Dr. Ruggieri said.

Nearing completion is a $2 million,
city-financed water pumping, filtration
and distribution station that “will sat.
isfy all the future sea-water needs” of
the aquarium, he said.

Man escapes serious iniunL

Elephant attacks zoo keeper

By JAMES T. CAMPBELL,
Post Reporter

 

A keeper at the Houston Zoo
narrowly escaped serious injury
Sunday when a 5-ton elephant, ap-
parently distressed that his terri-
tory was being invaded, wrapped
his trunk around the man’s neck
and lifted him from the ground.

Two Houston women say a rela-
tive climbed into the elephant’s
pen to distract the animal, allow-
ing the zoo keeper to escape.

William Nuesser, 27, was water-
ing several female elephants in an
adjacent pen about 2:30 pm. when
the male elephant, named Thai,
reached over a secondary bar
used to restrain him in his pen and
grabbed Nuesser by the neck, zoo
Director John Werler said.

Witnesses said the animal lifted
Nuesser from the ground and

t

rolled the man toward his mouth
before dropping him.

Nuesser was taken by ambu-
lance to Hermann Hospital where
he was treated for minor injuries
and released around 6 p.m.,
Werler said.

Werler said the 18-year-old
Asian elephant was experiencing a
periodic condition called “musth”
which makes the animal more
dangerous to the keeper.

“Elephants are potentially al-
ways dangerous,” said Werler,
who has been director of the Hous-
ton Zoo 24 years.

“Circus and zoo workers are in-
jured more frequently by ele-
phants than with any other ani-
mal. ”

Relatives 0f Jesse D. Frederick,
a 31-year-old chemical engineer
visiting the zoo with his family
Sunday, leaped to Nuesser’ s aid

when they heard the keeper’ 3
screams.

Karen Frederick, 31, said her
husband climbed over a tall fence
separating the elephant’s pen
from the public and then onto a ,
rock in middle of the pen to dis- ’
tract the elephant from Nuesser,
who was lying on the ground
where the animal had dropped
him. ,

“When the elephant made a
move towards my husband, the
zoo keeper stumbled to safety,”
Schwartz said. “It was a gruesome
sight. You could not see his
(Nuesser ’5) head when the ele-
phant swooped him up.’

Werler could not confirm the ac-
count of Karen Frederick or that
of her sister, Barbara Schwartz,
19. Werler said to the best of his
knowledge Nuesser was assisted
by another zoo keeper.

[Man hopes to break record

for ‘living’ with snakes

GULF BREEZE (UPI) -- A man
who once spent more than two

' months living with poisonous snakes

will try to break his own record this
summer at a Northwest Florida zoo.
Officials at The Zoo, east of Gulf
Breeze, said Sunday that Juergen
Hergert, who set the old record
nearly three years ago, will be
spending “100 days with 24 venom-
ous snakes" beginning May 16.
Hergert, who is currently in West
Germany, will be doing research,
“milking snakes and giving educa-
tional lectures," a zoo spokeswoman
said. She said details, including con-
struction of the glass-enclosed build-
ing, have yet to be worked out.
The Zoo, which is not yet 2 years
old, has more than 400 animals, in—

cluding large non-venomous snakes.

Hergert plans to spend three
months with five puff adders, 10 co-
bras, four vipers and five rattle-
snakes.

Beginning July 12, 1983, Hergert
lived with 24 snakes for 68 days and
three minutes at his snake farm in
Schladen, West Germany.

“We have the chance to do it in
Las Vegas, but Juergen didn’t want
to ruin his reputation and because
he has scientific research to do,”
said Wolfgang Domschke, Hergert’s
promoter.

"It’s a real strain,” Domschke
said. “Most snakes move at night.
The danger is if he falls asleep and
turns over, he might frighten the
snakes.”

Night vets ready
or emergencies

Clinics cater to sick, injuredpets

By DAVE PEGO
Staff writer

PLANO -— Tina trembles on the edge
of the cold metal table. She’s seven, it’s
late and the emergency clinic is not
where she wants to be.

“I was really worried,” Rose Fallas says
nervously as Dr. John Carver enters the
examination room in his blue smock.
“She hasn’t eaten since yesterday.”

Carver peers into Tina’s eyes, then
gives her a reassuring pat. “It’s all right,”
he says, brushing the hair from her eyes.
“She’s obviously depressed,” he says to
Fallas. “Her ears are down. But you can
tell she’s a friendly dog.”

It is 8:36 pm. and action is just begin-
ning at Plano’s newest emergency room

‘— the Emergency Animal Clinic of Collin ,

County. Located in a shopping center on
the north side of town, it is the sixth of its
kind in the Dallas area — a place where
animal owners can take sick or injured
pets when veterinary ofﬁces are closed.

After 10 years in similar clinics, Carver
knows what to expect.

“Someone will come home, have din-
ner, then discover their dog or cat is real
sick,” says the 38-year-old vet, one of four
who rotate shifts at night and on week-
ends. “Or they will let their animal out
after work and an accident happens.

“From 8 to 10:30, we’ll be busy. After
that, it will only be real emergencies.”

Dr. Jerry Wilson, one of the 22 veterin—
arians who co-own this clinic, says, “We
treat cats and dogs 99 percent of the time.
But from time to time, we’ll have birds,
turtles, snakes, chicks, gerbils — you
' name it.”

Technologically, the clinic is prepared
for just about anything. Two rooms are
‘ equipped with the latest surgical and X-
ray equipment. In another, a limp Sia-
mese cat struggles against an auto-im-
mune disease in a $6,000 intensive care
unit.

That’s pretty extreme. Most pets are

treated for vomiting, infectious diseases,
ﬁghts with other animals or collisions
with cars. Now and then an animal stum-
bles into a drug stash and is treated for an
overdose. “We’ve even had a couple of
drunk dogs on New Year’s Eve,” says
Carver.

Dealing with the animal’s physical
problem is only part of the challenge.
The night crew also faces the fairly con-
sistent problem of distressed pet owners.
Fallas was no exception.

“I was hitting the panic button,” admits
Fallas. “When it’s 8 at night and you real-
ize you have a sick pet, this is reassuring.
One hundred and thirty-four dollars is
not a drop in the bucket, but it’s what I’ll
spend to ﬁnd out what’s wrong with her.”

Lucky thing. Tina, the small white poo-
dle, is showing symptoms of diabetes. Al-
though she will have to take insulin shots
for the rest of her life, the early diagnosis
probably saved her life. .

It is a light night. Five dogs in, ﬁve out.
A normal nightly caseload is about 10
cases. Tonight’s pets are lucky. Five to 10
times a week, it is the last stop for an
animal.

“When a pet has a fractured spine and
you know it won’t be able to use its legs,
you have to recommend euthanasia,”
Carver says. “I hate it. You have a young
puppy that looks beautiful and you know
thatit . . .”

He throws up his hands. His voice trails
off. Often much more is lost than the ani-
mal’s life, he says. “Many times with old—
er peOple, these are their children,” he
says. ‘

“I remember diagnosing heart prob-
lems in one dog. I was going to recom-
mend that the dog be put to sleep be-
cause of its age until the woman told me
her husband had died of the same thing
recently. I did all I could to save that dog.
But the dog died.”

Carver swallows hard, then, in a near
whisper, adds: “Somebody told me she
died a few months later.”

‘ The , annua big chase in Wyoming

By Kim Anderson

ock_ Springs, Wy0.-—Roek, red sand and

steel-grey sagebrush blanket the ground from
horizon to horizon.

A bouldcred ridge in the foreground juts

100 feet above the bed of the enormous basin sur-

rounding it. From the top, the observer’s line of

sight touches mesas 50 miles away—without

touching a single tree. '

Wyoming’s Red Desert makes a man aware of
just how fragile he and his creations really are. The
enormous natural forces that created it are still at
work and it’s not a place where men walk easily.

All of which make it a perfect home for one of
the largest herds of wild horses in the nation.

“We’ve got somewhere around seven or eight
thousand of them out here, about 2,000 in this
district alone,” Bureau of Land Management staffer
Jack Steinbrech says, standing on the ridge top.

Down below, men unload saddle horses from
long trucks and a helicopter sits next to its fuel
truck—all in preparation for the first day of the
summer wild horse round~up in the Red Desert.

The site is about 70 miles northeast of Rock
.Springs, an equal distance south of what’s left of the
old Dry Sandy Pony Express station. Ten miles
west, on the far side of Freighter’s Gap, Steamboat
Mountain pokes up out of the ancient seabed.

“That’s what’s left: Nationwide, we’ve taken
about 15,000 out since the program started back in
-’7l. The thing is, they’ve got no natural predators
out here, and the research we’ve done indicates that
the herd size increases about 27 percent every
year.”

Not that it’s crowded out there. The Red Desert
is all that remains of an ancient sea, a 4.5—million.
acre area. Oxidation of minerals left behind when
the water evaporated gives it its distinctive color.

But like so many other remote regions of the
world, the Red Desert is feeling man’s impact. The
same qualities that make it prime mustang habi~
tat—a scarcity of predators and people, an
inexhaustible supply of open space—also make it.
prime sheep habitat.

When the Union Pacific railroad punched
through the desert in the last century, the govern—
ment awarded the company land for 20 miles on
both side's of the right~of—way—-—-but it gave the com-
pany rights to every other section [a section is 640
acres]. '

“It’s a checkerboard,” Steinbrech says.

“From here north,” waving his hand, “we own
just about all of it. But south to the highway, it’s
split about. 55 percent private and 45 percent BLM.
That makes it impossible to fence. but the ranchers
don’t want the mustangs using their range.”

Steinbrech can understand that. He’s Wyoming
born and bred, raised on a ranch near Lander and
educated in Laramie [where he earned a bachelor’s
degree in range management]. He has worked for
the BLM since graduation, and looks it.

In vorec and appearance, he bears an uncanny
resemblance to a young Jimmy Stewart. I keep ex-
pecting to hear him say “Waaal, ma’am. . .”

In the old days, ranchers used to cull the herds

until Congress decided the animals needed protec—

“Before passage of the Act. . .wild horses and bur-
ros were often captured to be sold for profit, chieﬂy
for use in commercial products, or destrOyed as
nuisances,” a BLM report says. “The methods em-
ploycd in their capture and destruction werétfgiisually
less than humane.” a»

But once the animals were officially classified as

the West,” [the Act’s language], the killing stopped,
and the herds started growing.

Within eight years, there were more than 12,000
horses in Wyoming’s herd.

“Funds were limited early on so we weren’t ac—
tively managing them and. . .well, the ranchers final-
ly brought suit,” Steinbrech says. ,

“Eventually—after a lot of negotiation—the BLM
reached a consensus with the ranchers and the in-
terested conservationist groups: We’d bring the herd
down to an agreed-upon management level, about
1,600 for this district and about 3,500 statewide.”

How is it done? How else? The round-up. [It’s
still a dusty, dirty process, whether it’s done on
horseback, or by truck and helicopter. And cowboys
are still cowboys: They always keep their spurs on.)

Steinbrech clambers back down to the trucks,
parked at the base of the ridge. This is a natural
trap the team has used before: tworidges running
into one another that. act as a wide—mouthed funnel.

Pilot Ron Shane, wearing a cherry-red ﬂight hel-
met with lightning stripes on both sides, takes hrs
machine up—a bubble cockpit Hiller UH-12E tur-
bojct. The green machine hangs over the fuel truck
[it contains about 400 gallons of jet fuel, enough for
three days of ﬂight time] for a brief moment in a
boiling cloud of dust and then bolts—a nose-down
climb into the sky. A minute later, he’s out of site
behind another ridge.

Camp settles down. It’s getting hotter by the min—
ute and no one wastes energy. These guys are all
veterans, anyway. They know it’s going to take
Shane a while to find the horses and bring them in,
and like all good soldiers everywhere, they don’t
stand when they can sit.

A point to ponder: Wranglers don’t really waIk
anywhere; with boots and spurs on, they kind of
rock through the sand and gravel.

Bruce Stevens and Vic McDarment could fit in
cowboy bars anywhere—even in New York City.
They’d be a little more weathered and a lot less
talkative than their mechanical-bull riding com—
padres, but they’d fit.

But Randy Krier is what cowboy’s are supposed
to look like. He’s wearing a big black sombrero. His
Levi’s are tucked into knee-high tooled leather
boots. Over all that, chaps and a vest, with big,
solid silver conchas running down the sides. And to
complete the look, a black walrus moustache.

A simple “Howdy. You guys. mind if I getyour
names before this place turns into a zoo” triggers
an explosion of laughter and guns, and this re-
sponse from Stevens: “Hey, this place is always a
zoo.”

At which point the faint, groWling whicker of the

helicopter triggers a controlled
scramble to get into position before
the mustangs do. Nettin has been
strung along the sides 0 the ridge,
channeling the horses into a chute
that ends in a corral. ,

Shane will drive the animals into '
“the trap. Kner and company will
'make sure they stay there. But’the
vmustangs, being mustangs, dOn’t
always cooperate. The wranglers
galloping up behind will make sure
they go where there supposed to.

They’re Just a cloud of dust at
first—a long storm-line Sweeping
across a bleak landscape, the hel-
icopter a black dot in the mael-
strom. .

Krier and company have con-
cealed themselves.
. “If they seewyou up there, they’ll
just turn around and head the
other way,” Steinbrech says. “And

remember, they’re wild animals.
They don’t need to see much to
figureout you’re there.” _

The herding process is a slow.

Buy your own horse

hat happens to the horses?
Bureau of Land Man-

" agement officials are con-
stantly asked this question, and the
answer is a simple one.

They are sold.

For a mere $125, you too can
own a mustang, or as the BLM
says, you can “adopt” One.

“We used to charge people-for
transportation,” BLM official Jack
Stembrech says. “But this year

.; we’re trying something else for the

first time: satellite adoption centers
set up around the country.”

Fifty or so animals will be availa-
ble at each center. Instead of
having to travel to a permanent fa-
cility, people interested in owning a

2' wild horse will be able to purchase

one from a temporary facility close
to home. '
If they meet the requirements.
The BLM launched its Adopt a
Horse [or burro] program in 1973
and over the years, adoption stan—

dards have gotten tougher.

Adopters must be of legal age,
free of any conviction for
inhumane treatment of animals,
and able to demonstrate their phys-
ical and ﬁnancial ability to care for

' the animals. [You can’t keep your

mu‘stang in the backyard]

A person can adopt up to four
animals a year, but ﬁnal title is not
granted until a year after delivery,

{set to change. Nevada and,

and the best selections. Centers in
' both states operate .: year—round.

or Rock Springs, Wyo.; [307-382-
5350]. Other year-round centers
are Susanville, Calif. [916-257-

Test of

.- ,~‘ a: 43.1%” _ antiwar

By KEITH SCHNEIDER
New York Times News Service

WASHINGTON —— A new era in
US. agriculture opened Oct. 9, 1985,
when veterinarian Roger Saline in-
jected a live, genetically altered vi-
rus into 250 piglets on a farm in
Bradford, 111. ~

It was the first time that a living
organism created by the techniques
of genetic engineering was used in
the field.

This event could eventually rank
alongside the introduction of trac—
tors and insecticides in the develop-
ment of modern agriculture. It
opens the way to huge increases in
production and diversity in Ameri-
can farming through the capability
to manipulate the basic genetic
structure of plants, animals and mi-
croscopic organisms.

But- every new technology has
been accompanied by consequences
for the environment and human
health. Scientists say that genetical-
ly altered organisms like that used
by Saline have the ability to multi-
ply, mutate and cause unforesee-
able damage. Because essentially
new forms of life are involved, it is
impossible to predict the conse-
quences of such organisms’ release
into the general environment.

The situation might be compared
to the introduction of exotic plant or
animal species into non-native envi-
ronments —-- f or example, the major
nuisance created by the introduc-
tion of the European starling into
North America, where the bird’s
natural enemies are not present.
Similarly, epidemics have decimat-
ed tribal peoples when exposure to
outsiders brought diseases their
bodies were unprepared to fight off.

Yet until Thursday, when the De-
partment of Agriculture acknowl-
edged that it had approved the field
tests of the pig vaccine and then, in
January, granted a Nebraska com-
pany the world’s first license to sell a
living gene-altered product, the en-
tire program to bring the virus to
market had taken place without
public awareness. ,

The disclosures were made by the
Foundation on Economic Trends, a

group seeking to reven
ucts of biotechnology frtoglergagg:
mg the market. They came as the
government was in the midst of a
grand experiment to formulate a
regulatory program for an industry
that has not yet caused a problem
Regulators are seeking to prevent
the sort of environmental and pub-
lic health problems that have
marked previous introductions of
new technologies. Almost 40 years

ago, for example, a new law gave the
Agriculture Department full au-
thority to oversee the marketing
and introduction of pesticides. But
critics contend that the department
did not aggressively test pesticides
for human and environmental con-
sequences, and decades later the re-
sults include polluted rivers, con-
taminated underground reservoirs
and toxic dumps filled with pesti-
cide wastes.

“The whole point of attempting'to
put a regulatory program in place is
that we have a chance to do it right
this time,” said Skip Stiles, adminis-
trative assistant to Rep. George E.
Brown J r., a California Democrat
who is one of Capitol Hill’s leading
biotechnology specialists. “The nu-
clear physicists said trust us, there is
no danger from nuclear power. The
chemists said that without their pes-
ticides and petrochemicals life itself
would not be possible — we should
trust them, too. Now the biologists
are coming forward with their pow-
erful technology. and the govern—

. ment is saying we want to see what

we can do to avert environmental

' and public health calamities.”

Stiles was one of many experts in
and out of the government who ex-
pressed concern Friday about the
actions of a small group of scientists
in the Agriculture Department’s An-
imal and Plant Health Inspection
Service. It was their decision that
permitted the Omaha-based Biolq
gics Corp. to, market its virus as a
vaccine against a deadly herpes dis-
ease in swine.

Scientists disagree on whether
the gene-altered vaccine poses a
threat to the health of farm animals
or people. In most cases, they said,
animal viruses do not infect people.
But some animal viruses might; the
AIDS virus, for example, is known to
infect green monkeys in Africa.

Moreover, live viral vaccines can,
through the secretions of inoculat-
ed animals, infect other animals.
They are capable of suppressing the
immune system, making the ani-
mals more susceptible to other dis-
eases, according to Dr. Michael Fox,
a veterinarian and scientific direc-
tor of the Humane Society of the
United States.

“There could be a human dan-
ger,” he said. “When we’re filling
farm animals with weakened live
viruses it could become a big health
problem because they can transfer
to the human host.”

In addition, many officials are
wondering if, in making key policy
decisions without notifying other

experts, the agency scientists violat-
ed the government’s 8~year—old
guidelines for releasing living gene-
altered agents into the environ-
ment.
Dr. George P. Shibley, a microbiol-
ogist in the inspection service, said
no regulations were violated be-
cause the gene-altered vaccine was
similar to other living viral vaccines
that his division regularly reviews
and approves for the market.
Moreover, Shibley said, he did not
consider injecting a vaccine into an

. animal to be an environmental re
‘1 lease and therefore he did not feel
i that the decision to allow field tests

of the gene-altered virus needed to

be reviewed by experts outside of
his own office.

Other top scientists at the depart-
ment strongly disagreed.

Dr. Sue A. Tolin, co~chairman of
the department’s Recombinant
DNA Research Committee, a scien-
tific body established to review all
applications to f ield-test genetically

. altered products, said most scien-

tists considered live virus injections
to be releases into the environment.
Tolin said she would have told this to
Shibley, but that he never brought
the Biologics application before her

committee.

Dr. John Fulkerson, the Depart-

“ ment of Agriculture’s principal sci-

entist, said the incident bore strik-
ing similarities to the agency’s

regulatory efforts at the start of the
last great era in agriculture, the era
i of pesticides.

From 1947, when the nation’s pes-

' ticide control law was enacted, to

1970, when pesticide regulation was

‘ transferred to the Environmental

Protection Agency, Agriculture De
partment scientists quietly ap
proved some of the most hazardous

' chemicals ever manufactured with-

out considering whether the sub
stances could damage human health
or the environment.

These chemicals —— including
DDT, heptachlor, chlordane, EDB,
