products and technical developments which enable veterinarians to
keep abreast of the times in their service to clients and patients. The
Professional Exhibits and the Scientiﬁc Exhibits are in the Exhibit
Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center. The exhibit hours during

formed ushers in attendance outside the various meeting rooms and
exhibit hall have been instructed to refuse admission to persons not
having registration badges.

Environmental Health and Ecology: Old Concepts with
New Meaning for Man's Survival

William F. McCulloch. D.V.M.. M.P.H.

Columbia, Missouri

No socially aware professional person would deny that the en-
vironment is changing. In man’s obsession for things, things, and more
things, he has forgotten that he is not merely an observer of NATURE,
but an integral part of it! The environment has been a great, but
unappreciated, “friend”——-nature’s air, water, plants, animals, and
soil have provided natural beneﬁts for man’s survival. However,
trends such as concentration of animal and human populations, tech-
nologic developments in agriculture and in industry have “shaken"
nature’s balance.

Fortunately there has been a national awakening that environ-
mental pollution must be drastically reduced. Resources in the form
of “dollars” will be needed. Equally important, man must become
knowledgeable about the fundamentals of ecology if he is to make
intelligent value judgments about the uses of science and technology
in the future.

Veterinary medicine as a profession must be considered a national
resource for aiding in the solution of environmental problems. It is
imperative that we, as veterinarians, increase our awareness of these
problems and take steps toward their solution. As professionals and
citizens, we have no choice but to accept increased responsibility for
helping to improve the health of the total animal kingdom of which

man is a part.

The Dimensions of Veterinary Medicine: a Glimpse
Through the Looking-Glass

Calvin W. Schwabe. D.V.M.. M.P.H.. Sc.D.

Davis, California

As we enter a new decade, it is appropriate to examine the dimen-
sions of veterinary medicine and our successes and failures in approach-
ing their full realization. It is clear to many of us that in the past the
main thrusts of our profession’s activities—and certainly our collective
vision of what veterinary medicine really is—have been limited more
often than not by a lack of public understanding, or by the extent to
which our professional organizations have conceptualized our ﬁeld, or

|02

 




by what our schools of veterinary medicine have actually prepared the;
graduates to do.

Not only is the true utility of veterinary medicine to society not
restrained by such artiﬁcial bounds as these, but the breadth of activi-
ties engaged in by veterinarians today clearly indicates that many of
us are not at all willing to accept these limits.

There are numerous indications that the 1970’s will see the real
beginning of our comprehension as a profession of what heretofore have
been almost exclusively individual, and hence fragmentary, insights
into the true limits of veterinary medicine’s implied responsibilities to
society. If this comes to pass, it is certain that each of us will begin
to see more clearly the signiﬁcance of his own place and role in the
”1 overall picture of a broad academic ﬁeld—one which uniquely and
simultaneously serves mankind as a health science, an agricultural
science, and as an increasingly important bioenvironmental science.

Animal Technicians and the Veterinarian

ut In considering animal technicians today, it is important to review

rid their past and even more important to study the expectations of their

at, status in the future.

h- In reviewing their past, early expressions of interest in the animal

about their present status traced.

n- In discussing their present, the recently published AVMA Guide-

m lines for Training Animal Technicians is most important. Certain

First Equine Session

(I) Ovulation Site in the Mare

“ Den M. Witherspoon. D.V.M.
Athens, Georgia

Two hypotheses have prevailed for several years concerning the
site of ovulation in the mare. A cineradiographic and histologic study
of the ovary in the mare was carried out in order to determine the
ovulation site. The research involved the use of ﬁberoptics, cineradi-

w w W I

'l V

ography, India ink, translocation, and histologic evaluation. A total
of 7 mares were studied. The animals were followed through 25
estrous cycles collectively. Following in vivo studies using ﬁberoptics,
cineradiography, and translocation of the ovary, the results were fur-
ther conﬁrmed by histologic sections and the use of India ink as a
tracer of follicular ﬂuid.

The conclusion of the resarch was that in 2%- to 15-year-old mares,
ovulation occurs only through the Ovarian fossa.

(3) Abortion and Placental Lesions in the Mare

Milton E. Prickett. D.V.M.
Lexington, Kentucky

Equine fetal disease, as a result of pathologic change of the placenta,
is described as a two-part event. The ﬁrst concerns the lesions of the
fetus which are related to both the development of fetal resistance
mechanisms and to the pathologic events occurring in the placenta.
It is demonstrated that, for the most part, the lesions in a fetus of
sufficient age so as to be capable of resisting stress are nonspeciﬁc and
indicate only the presence of placental changes. The most consistent
lesions are emaciation and fatty livers.

The second part deals with the wide variety of placental lesions
which may subsequently result in the death and abortion of the fetus.
Included in this portion are discussions of etiology, incidence, pathol-
ogy, and pathogenesis.

(4) Stallion Seminal Characteristics and Sexual Behavior
in Relation to Semen Evaluation

B. W. Pickett. Ph.D.
Fort Collins, Colorado

Reproductive efﬁciency is lower in the horse than in other species
of livestock. Major contributing factors are (1) reluctance of owners
to have semen from their stallions evaluated, (2) lack of information
on methods of semen evaluation, and (3) failure to select for fertility.

Seminal characteristics and sexual behavior of stallions are affected
by the season of the year; both must be considered when semen is
evaluated. From observations on semen collected throughout the year,
we have concluded that seminal volume, sperm per milliliter, total
sperm, pH, and motility are essential measurements for proper semen
evaluation.

The stallion should be rested sexually for a week prior to collecting
samples, and 2 ejaculates should be collected at hourly intervals for
evaluation. The ejaculates should be approximately equal in volume;
the second ejaculate should contain about one-half the total number
of spermatozoa, have a higher pH, and motility equal to or better than
the ﬁrst ejaculate. Unless these relationships exist, the following pos-
sibilities should be considered: (1) one or both ejaculates were not
representative samples, (2) the stallion has defective epididymal physi-
ology, or (3) the stallion has abnormal sperm reserves.

(5) Mechanical Effects and Surgical Correction
of Laryngeal Hemiplegia in Horses

M. P. Mackay-Smith. D.V.M.. M.S.: D. Marks. V.M.D.;
J. A. Leslie. D.V.M.; L. S. Cushing. V.M.D.

Newark, Delaware

Recent work has indicated that the Gunther-Williams-Hobday
ventriculo-sacculectomy is an inadequate solution to equine laryngeal
hemiplegia (“roaring”), both theoretically and practically. This re—
port reviews the normal and pathologic anatomy and mechanics of
the equine larynx, the primary and differential diagnostic criteria
for laryngeal hemiplegia, and the more speciﬁc procedures recently
developed for the surgical correction of the effects of laryngeal hemi-
plegia. A 40-minute ﬁlm of endoscopic cinematography and surgical
technique will accompany the descriptions.

Large Animals—Second Equine Session

(6) Radiography in Equine Carpal Lameness
Timothy R. O'Brien. D.V.M.. Ph.D.

Davis, California

Determination of the anatomic abnormality responsible for carpal
lamenessm the horse is one of the most difﬁcult problems confronting
veterinarians. Radiography usually is employed to evaluate the changes
respons1b1e for the lameness. The basic radiography in the examination
of the equine carpus is described brieﬂy.

A radiologic study of 80 consecutive cases of carpal lameness was
done. The results of that retrospective study are presented to acquaint
thewetermary practitioner with the ﬁndings. Fractures of the distal
radius and the different carpal bones are discussed in regard to inci-
dence, location, nature, and duration. The radiologic aspects of syno-
v1t1s_ and. tenosynovitis are also discussed. The effects that corticos-
tiroiddmjectlons have when injected into diseased joints are demon-
s ra e .

(7) Healing of Articular Cartilage in the Horse
W. E. Riddle. Jr.. V.M.D.

Davis, California

Full-thickness defects were surgically created in the articular car-
tilage on the anteroproximal surface of the 3rd carpal bone in 4 horses
and 7 ponies. The animals were euthanatized at intervals of 1, 2, 4,
6, and 8 months postoperatively. The lesions were examined grossly,
histologically, and microradiographically.

Healing was slow and incomplete. The defects gradually ﬁlled in
with granulation tissue which originated at the articular margin. This

I05

 

 

 




 

granulation tissue underwent metaplastic change to form ﬁbrocartilage
by 4 months and hyaline cartilage by 8 months. However, the defects
were not completely ﬁlled in after 8 months. Healing was more rapid
on the lateral facet of the 3rd carpal bone than on the medial facet.

Lesions were seen in the opposing articular surface of the distal
end of the radial carpal bone. Roughening of the articular cartilage
was present by 4 months and spur formation was apparent by 8
months.

(8) Surgical Arthrodesis of the Distal Tarsal Joints for
Treatment of Bone Spavin in Horses

0. R. Adams. D.V.M.. M.S.
Fort Collins, Colorado

In spite of numerous methods of therapy for bone spavin, some
animals do remain lame and resistant to all conventional types of
therapy. Cunean tenectomy, ﬁring, blistering, neurectomy, and cor-
rective shoeing have all been used with variable results. The horse
is usually lame until ankylosis of the involved joint (s) occurs. Anky-
losis of these joints is surgically produced by destroying the majority
of the joint cartilage with a 14-inch bone drill in the involved joint
or joints. The procedure of this operation is discussed. Results have
been encouraging in long-standing cases of bone spavin.

(9) Effects of Succinylcholine Compared with Those of
Thiamylal Sodium tor Restraint Prior to Inhalation
Anesthesia in Horses

Robert B. Heath. D.V.M.. M.Sc.. and Albert A. Gabel, D.V.M.. M.Sc.
Fort Collins, Colorado, and Columbus, Ohio

Clinical trials which present the cardiovascular changes seen during
the use of succinylcholine or thiamylal sodium illustrate the differ-
ences in the two drugs. Data and conclusions indicate that succinyl-
choline is not safe for routine restraint for induction of inhalation
anesthesia. The severe blood pressure changes are traumatic to the
animal and upset the anesthesia program which follows. Thiamylal
results in a more gentle restraint during which there are some sig-
niﬁcant blood pressure changes. However, there is more time available
for induction with an overall anesthetic program less traumatic to
the horse.

Conclusions can be drawn from the physiologic monitoring of these
patients as to the use of succinylcholine or thiamylal sodium alone
for restraint only (such as in a short minor surgical procedure without
anesthesia maintenance). A short comparative note on the use and
physiologic effects of glyceryl guaiacolate suggests that it is likely
to be a good drug for induction of inhalation anesthesia.

(l0) Effects of Succinylcholine Compared with Those of
Promazine and Succinylcholine on the Cardiovascular
and Respiratory Systems of the Horse

Roy S. Zinnl lll. D.V.M.: Albert A. Gabel, D.V.M.. M.Sc.;
Robert B. Heath, D.V.M.. M.Sc.
Columbus, Ohio, and Fort Collins, Colorado

The efﬁcacy and risk of the use of succinylcholine as a restraining
agent in horses is reviewed.

On each of 6 horses, continuous direct blood pressure, electro-
cardiogram (ECG) and respiratory rates were recorded, and samples
for blood gases and pH were taken at 2-minute intervals for 10 min-
utes after each injection of succinylcholine.

Succinylcholine (0.05 mg./lb.) was given IV. The horses were al-
lowed or urged to rise after 10 minutes. Ten minutes later, promazine,
0.33 mg./1b., was given IV and 20 minutes was allowed for maximal
effect, when the dose of succinylcholine was repeated.

The average blood pressure was 143/94 mm.Hg at rest and rose
to an average of 317/185 mm.Hg after succinylcholine was given.
Twenty minutes after administration of promazine, the blood pressure
was 120/88 mm.Hg, and succinylcholine then caused it to rise only
to 206/126 mm.Hg. Pulse rate increased after succinylcholine before
and after the promazine injection, and arrhythmia occurred similarily.
Hypoventilation or apnea for up to 30 seconds occurred, often result-
ing in mild cyanosis. Arterial and venous P02 decreased, Poo2 increased
and pH decreased after every injection of succinylcholine. These
changes were less severe after the use of promazine.

(I I) Evaluation of Closed. Semiclosed. and
Nonrebreathing Inhalation Anesthesia
Systems in the Horse

Charles E. Short. D.V.M.

Columbia, Missouri

Much has been said concerning the correct way to use inhalation
anesthesia in the horse. In most instances the comments have con-
cerned a piece of equipment or an anesthetic technique which has
been helpful to individual veterinarians. ‘ .

An evaluation has been made using closed, semiclosed, and non-
rebreathing inhalation systems with variations in types of Vrebreathing
circuits and vaporizers based on the physiologic responses of the
horse. In the author’s opinion, these results enable the veterinarian
to better understand the relation of function of the equipment, anes-
thetic of choice, and responses of the equine patient.

Conclusions are based on analysis of recordings of blood pressure,
heart rates, electrocardiograms (ECG) , minute and tidal volumes, blood
gases, pH, and recovery responses. Both methoxyﬂurane and halo-
thane were used in these studies.

Large Animals—Ovine Session

(I2) Herd Health Program in Large Lamb Feedlot
Operation

Robert E. Pierson. D.V.M.
Fort Collins, Colorado

Veterinary medicine has undergone rapid change in large animal
areas during the last few years. The “ﬁre engine” practice which
concentrated on the individual animal was popular a few years ago.
Today the emphasis is on herd health with a program emphasizing
preventive medicine. This type of practice is not only challenging but
exciting as well.

The purpose of any health program involving meat-producing ani—
mals is to help the owner increase the pounds of meat produced in
a feedlot. Objectives of the program include: (1) to reduce the
mortality of lambs in the feedlot, (2) to reduce the incidence of
sickness, (3) to improve the quality of the lamb, (4) to gain knowledge
of the common diseases present in the feedlot, (5) to make lamb feed—
ing more proﬁtable, and (6) to determine susceptibility of lambs to
disease according to origin of lambs.

In order to accomplish these objectives, the veterinarian must be-
come involved in the total industry. When one becomes “involved”
he not only excels in the recognition of diseased animals, but also
in how to prevent disease. Knowledge of nutrition, management, and
economics is important for they each relate to health. Becoming
involved means being part of the team.

The purpose of this paper will be to discuss a health program
involving a large feedlot fattening over 55,000 lambs per year. The
program will be reviewed so that ideas on record keeping, protocol,
and management may be of help to any veterinarian interested in
herd health work.

(I3) Factors in Disease and Mortality of Lambs

Clifford C. Beck. D.V.M.l M.S.: Geraldine B. Cords. M.R.S.;
Harold A. Henneman. Ph.D.
‘Ann Arbor and East Lansing, Michigan

Present interest and emphasis in the US. sheep industry is related
to accelerated lambing programs, increased multiple births, and in-
tensiﬁed sheep operations. Experience has shown that with intensi-
ﬁcation, conﬁnement, and various types of accelerated programs, the
incidence of disease and mortality often rise, and the role of manage-
ment and the preventive approach to the problem become of increasing
importance. The US. sheep industry is currently losing 15 to 20%
of its lamb crop. No industry can consider itself healthy with such a
mortality rate. A review of literature pertaining to lamb mortality
plus data based on a survey of lamb losses over a 20-year period in the
ﬂock at Michigan State University is presented. The» authors present
some points for consideration in attempting to reduce lamb mortality.

(I4) Pregnancy Diagnosis in the Ewe

L. M. Koger. D.V.M.
Pullman, Washington

Early clinical determination of pregnancy in the ewe has many
advantages both in commercial operations and in research projects.
Pregnancy produces changes in the cervix that in some cases may be
determined by digital palpation in the vagina. By contrast, the
typical cervix of the nonpregnant ewe normally is palpable permitting
a negative pregnancy test for designating proper management of
those ewes.

Criteria for practical procedures are compared with techniques
reported previously. The report of investigations underway at Wash-
ington State University include rectal palpation by persons with small
hands, the bimanual technique employed in human medicine, digital
palpation of the cervix, and simpliﬁed identiﬁcation of the individual.

(l5) Selenium Responsive Disease in Sheep
0. H. Muth. D.V.M.

Corvallis, Oregon

Naturally occurring selenium deﬁciency is common throughout
large land areas of the world including approximately one-half of
the United States. Where feeds contain less than 0.05 p.p.m. selenium,
disease occurs in varying degrees depending on the presence of en-
hancing or interfering substances in the feed. -

There is a pharmacodynamic interrelationship between selenium
and vitamin E, and that vitamin is the most important enhancing
substance for selenium. Sulfur, arsenic, and some other substances
interfere with the metabolic action of selenium.

The most commonly noticed lesion resulting from selenium-vitamin
E deﬁciency in sheep is degeneration of the cardiac and skeletal mus-
cles (white muscle disease), but unthriftiness, early embryonic death,
and periodontal disease have also been found to be selenium responsive.

(l6) Strains of Haemonchus contortus. Resistant to

Vassilios J. Theo‘dorides, D.V.M.. Ph.D.: 6. C. Scott' D.V.M.:
M. Laderman, M.S.

West Chester, Pennsylvania

Five isolates of Haemonchus contortus from sheep and 1 isolate
from Angora goats resistant to the recommended dose level (50 mg./
kg.) of thiabendazole were found to be resistant to the recommended
level (20 mg./kg.) of parbendazole, a new benzimidazole anthelmintic.
The resistant strains which were investigated were derived from the
states of Texas, New Mexico, Oregon, and Kentucky. One strain was
obtained from Australia. This strain was found to respond to 3 times
the recommended level of either thiabendazole or parbendazole. A
single dose of parbendazole of 60 mg. /kg. of body weight and of thia-
bendazole of 150 mg. /kg. of body weight eliminated 99 and 94% of H.
contortus, respectively.

(I7) The Sheep as a Model for Studying
Electrophysiologic and Behavioral
Effects of Neurotoxicants

Gary A. Van Gelder. D.V.M.. Ph.D.; William B. Buck. D.V.M.. M.S.:
George G. Karas .

Ames, Iowa

Various types of chemicals, because of their neurotoxic properties,
are current or potential public health problems. These neurotoxicants
may cause overt toxicity or may act more subtly through alteration
of behavioral capabilities in the absence of clinical toxicity. Neuro-
toxicants studied included DDT, dieldrin, ruelene, and lead.

Laboratory methods were developed for studying the subclinical
behavioral and electrophysiologic effects of neurotoxicants in sheep.
Electrodes were surgically placed on and in the brain, and the electro-
encephalograms were recorded from unrestrained animals via radio-
telemetry. Exposure to DDT resulted in an increased voltage and
frequency of the arousal electrocorticogram which persisted for 2
weeks. Large amplitude slow wave spindles occurred in the electro-
corticogram following exposure to dieldrin, a chlorinated hydrocarbon
insecticide.

Tasks for evaluation of behavior were developed in conjunction
with an experimental psychologist. Exposure to dieldrin had no effect
on the rate of extinction of a conditioned avoidance task or on the
number of trials required to solve a detour food maze. Sheep exposed
to dieldrin required signiﬁcantly more trials to relearn a Y maze
visual discrimination problem than did unexposed controls. Perfor-
mance on an operant-vigilance task was decreased by 60% following
exposure to dieldrin. Similar methods can be used to study the
effects of other neurotoxicants.

 

Large Animals—First Swine Session

(I8) Health of the Pig Reared in Conﬁnement
John R. Andersen. D.V.M.. M.S.

Ames, Iowa

 

High land and labor costs combined with a desire by producers to
increase their volume has stimulated development of conﬁnement hog
production. Disease prevention or lack of it often determines success
or failure of these facilities which makes the swine veterinary prac-
titioner a key person to the hog producer.

Social and stress diseases, such as tail biting and gastric ulcers,
have a relationship to pen size and number of pigs per pen. Im-
proper ﬂoOr surfaces increase the incidence of spraddle-legged pigs
and arthritic problems in pigs. ,

Carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane, and hydrogen sulﬁde are
examples of toxic gases produced by stored animal wastes. Their

IIO

 

 




 

potential effects to the pig include reduced weight gain, increased
susceptibility to infectious diseases, and deaths.

Bacterial buildup in this farrowing house is enhanced by damp,
humid conditions due to improper ventilation and may result in
severe scour problems in baby pigs.

Breeding stock for conﬁnement rearing should have desirable dis—
positions, soundness of feet and legs, and be from bloodlines known
to be free of porcine stress syndrome. Herds should also be free of
swine dysentery, Bordetella rhinitis, mycoplasmal pneumonia, myco-
plasmal arthritis, brucellosis, lice, and mange.

(20) Mycoplasmal Arthritis of Swine
Richard F. Ross. D.V.M.. and J. Robert Duncan, D.V.M.

Ames, Iowa, and Athens, Georgia

M ycoplasma granularum is a common cause of arthritis in 100-
to ZOO-lb. swine. Field observations and research in progress indicate
that heavy muscling, genetic background, and stress act as predisposing
factors in the disease.

The acute disease is characterized by a sudden onset, lameness of
variable severity, and a 3- to 10-day course. Subsequently, ﬂareups
or long-standing chronic arthritis may be seen.

Necropsy of acutely affected swine reveals increased serosan-
guineous synovial ﬂuid in the femorotibial, coxofemoral, cubital, or
scapulohumeral joints. The tarsal and metatarsal joints are less
frequently affected. The synovial membranes are swollen, hyperemic,
and discolored, but the joint capsule and articular surfaces appear
normal. Synovial lining cell hyperplasia, villous hypertrophy, and
extensive mononuclear cell inﬁltration are seen in microscopic sections
of the synovial membranes.

M ycoplasma granularum can be isolated and grown in a medium
composed of 85% bacto PPLO broth with 0.5% bacto mucin and 15%
heated turkey serum. Intravenous inoculation of susceptible, heavily
muscled swine with cultures grown in this medium results in clinical
signs and lesions identical to those seen in the natural disease. The
organism can be re-isolated from the joints, lymph nodes, tonsils, and
mucous membrane surfaces.

(2|) Status of the Mastitis-Metritis-Agalactia Complex
Charles E. Martin, D..VM.. MUS

Columbia, Missouri

The well-known lactation failure syndrome appears to be as prev-
alant in 1970 as ever. Recognition of the disease entity is not a
problem because of many clinical descriptions over the years and
because of the prevalence of the disease. Treatment of affected sows
is standard to most veterinarians; however, many are inquiring regard-
ing new regimens of therapy because of inconsistent treatment results.

The cause of the disease syndrome is unknown. Research efforts
during the last decade have placed serious doubt on many of the
suggested etiologic factors. These research efforts have proved adrenal
cortical function alteration and revealed positive correlation between
drug use as a preventive measure and incidence of the disease. Hemo-
globin values have again been determined to be decreased. Bacterial

 

 




 

 

involvement cannot be supported as a basic cause but is believed to
be a secondary factor that prolongs the course of the disease, with
an increase in baby pig deaths because of hypoglycemia and enteritis.

Clinical trials directed toward prevention and improved therapy
have not been especially rewarding, but encouraging enough to war-
rant further study.

(22) Pregnancy Diagnosis of Swine Utilizing the
Vaginal Biopsy Technique

Edward C. Mather. D.V.M.. Ph.D.; John R. Diehl. B.S.:
Myron Tumbleson. Ph.D.

Columbia, Missouri

Pregnancy diagnosis in swine can be made with high accuracy,
utilizing a vaginal biopsy technique. Various methods of handling
tissues are described, as well as methods used in preparation of
histologic sections. Adaptation and limitations involving routine
commercial use and use by the swine veterinary practitioner are ex-
plained. Results are reported from tissue obtained from packing
plant specimens, swine in commercial swine raising operations, and
estrus synchronized swine. Accuracy of this technique falls between
90 to 95% if samples are obtained no sooner than 21 days post-
breeding.

Rupture of the bovine stiﬂe joint was repaired by use of a strip
of skin taken from the stiﬂe region. The skin strip, which is intended
to serve as a prosthetic ligament, is applied by inserting it through
tunnels drilled in the femur and tibia, and securing the free ends
to each other. The procedure requires opening of the femorotibial
joint capsule and temporary medial dilecation of the patella.

Miller’s feed sack tie using No. 2 chromic catgut that is transﬁxed in
the tissues.

The tie is a slight variation of a clove hitch, and when pulled tight
will bind and remain secure with no loosening.

(30) Use of Glyceryl Guaiacolate in Equine Anesthesia
T. N. Phillips. D.V.M.. M.S.

Naperville, Illinois

Glyceryl guaiacolate has been employed by the author and his
associates since November, 1965, for its muscle-relaxing properties in
conjunction with barbiturates (primarily pentothal sodium) as our
basic ultra-shortacting anesthetic. Aceprovazine is given IV (approx.
0.03 mg. / lb. of body weight) approximately 20 minutes prior to admin-
istering the glyceryl guaiacolate-dextrose-pentothal sodium solution IV
through a 12-gauge needle.

The combination of glyceryl guaiacolate, 60 Gm. (5%); dextrose,
60 Gm. (5%); and pentothal sodium, 2 Gm. (0.175%) in 1,200 ml. of
distilled water gives an excellent, smooth “lay—down” and a quiet
recovery. For longer surgical procedures, the horse is intubated and
halothane is used to maintain anesthesia.

(3|) Safety-Toxicity ot Melengestrol Acetate
in Domestic Animals

J. H. Sokolowski. D.V.M.. Ph.D.: T. G. Schalk. D.V.M.

Kalamazoo, Michigan

A progestational steroid (MGA) has unique oral activity when fed
to ruminants. Estrus and ovulation are inhibited at doses of 0.5 mg.
daily. This steroid is currently in use for feedlot heifers to improve
rate of gain and feed efﬁciency. It has been successfully used for
estrus synchronization. The capacity of the cow to express estrus
returns following cessation of MGA feeding. Breeding at estrus within
about 8 days of MGA feeding often results in reduction of conception
rate. Breeding at second estrus results in an equal or higher con-
ception rate. Feeding of this steroid postbreeding resulted in a
signiﬁcant lowering of conception rate when initiated on day 2 but
not on day 4. Feeding MGA during pregnancy and early lactation
resulted in no abnormalities in either cows or calves and did not alter
calving time or diﬂiculty. Calf birth weights were reduced, but wean-
ing weights were not different. Subsequent reproductive performance
of calves was not affected. At 1.0 mg. daily during lactation, MGA
did not alter milk production or constituents. Feeding MGA did not
decrease the ability of cows to combat uterine bacterial (Escherichia
coli) challenge.

(32) Mecadox for the Treatment and Control of
Swine Dysentery

Dreyfus L. Froe. ll. D.V.M., M.S.

Terre Haute, Indiana

Mecadox is a nonantibiotic compound belonging to a family of
compounds classiﬁed as quinoxaline-di-N-oxides. Eﬂicacy against arti-
ﬁcially as well as naturally occurring epizootics of swine dysentery
has been proven. The refractory nature of swine dysentery to cur-
rently used drugs and the fact that no member of this family of com-
pounds is currently being used in human or veterinary medicine makes
this a particularly Valuable drug. Mecadox is presently intended for
use in feed at a level of 50 Gm./ ton. Clinical evaluations, including
performance data are included.

(33) A New Anabolic Agent for Ruminants
Ross 6. Brown. D.V.M.

Terre Haute, Indiana

Livestock production has beneﬁted signiﬁcantly by the use of
chemical compounds during the past 25 years. Such compounds com-
plement advances in disease control, animal breeding, and nutrition.
Zeranol is the generic name of a new chemical compound recently
approved by the US. Food and Drug Administration for ﬁnishing
beef steers. It is identiﬁed by the chemical name 6- (6,10-dihydroxy-

undecyl) -,8-resorcylic acid-,u-lactone and is sold under the trademark
Ralgro. Zeranol is a nonsteroid chemical. It is a derivative of
zearalenone, a metabolite of a selected strain of Gibberella zeae.
Zearalenone is a member of a rare class of natural products, the
.8-resorcylates. Because of the nature of the chemical structure this
group of compounds is called resorcylic acid lactones, often abbreviated
to RAL’s. ‘

Zeranol is classed pharmacologically as a protein anabolic agent.
This ﬁnding led to animal research designed to describe safety and
eﬂicacy. These initial studies were followed by dose-range experi-
ments and ﬁnally by trials with a large number of ruminants main-
tained under different management systems and located in different
geographical areas.

The US. Food and Drug Administration, as of March, 1970, has
approved zeranol for use in feedlot steers only. However, research
has indicated that other classes of young cattle and lambs respond
to administration of the compound. Adverse reactions attributable to
zeranol administration were not observed.

(34) Applications of Silicone Rubber Implants in Livestock

Myron D. Brown, D.V.M.; l. D. Smith. Pl1.D.; R. H. Rippel. Ph.D.:

E. W. Seymour. Ph.D.: R. E. Mauer. Ph.D.
North Chicago, Illinois

A successful method of effecting a constant, predictable release of
steroids over a long period has been achieved by the Use of silicone
rubber implants. Results from in vitro tests and from in vivo studies
in swine, cattle, and sheep indicate a great potential exists to utilize
this phenomenon for improved livestock production. When utilized
subcutaneously, the release rate from implants is determined by the
membrane thickness and the surface area. Trials indicate that pro-
gesterone-silicone rubber implants are effective in inducing syn-
chronized anestrous breeding in ewes; that barrows implanted with
silicone rubber implants containing diethylstilbestrol (DES) and testos-
terone propionate require less feed per unit of gain, produce a higher
yield of lean cuts and a smaller percentage of fat trim when com-
pared to the controls; and that steers implanted with DES-silicone
rubber implants gain more rapidly and more efﬁciently than control
steers or steers implanted with commercially available DES implants.

(36) Advantages of Blending a Fermentation Product
into Livestock Rations

Robert L. Hoff. D.V.M.. and Vernon w. Rice. 3.5.. M.T.

Storm Lake, Iowa

The fermentation product we will discuss is a pure culture of a
hybred nonviable Lactobacillus acidophilus. Numerous laboratory
and ﬁeld studies have been completed indicating the following advan-
tages of the product when blended into an adequate livestock ration:

1) A deﬁnite effect on pH of the digestive system of both' animals
with simple stomachs and ruminant animals has been determined.

ll5

 

 




 

 

2) Fourteen amino acids have been identiﬁed in the pure culture.
These serve as intermediate nutrients for the normal microﬂora of
the digestive tract.

3) A better plan of health of animals given the product regularly
has been observed. The product contains a natural ingredient that
shows as a benzene ring in the range of penicillin G.

4) The crude protein content of the ration can generally be reduced
about 2% due to better digestibility of the feedstuffs by increased
bacterial and protozoan activity.

5) There is documented evidence that the product is of thera-
peutic value in numerous chronic ailments of the digestive system.

Large Animals—First Bovine Session

(37) Protons. pH' and Survival

Alastair R. Michell. B. Vet. Med.. PhD.
New York, New York

The physiology and clinical physiology of acid-base balance is a
complex and rapidly evolving subject. Its importance to veterinarians,
not only those in large animal practice, seems certain to increase
sharply with time. Within the scope of the paper, the emphasis
will be on an intelligible development of principles rather than an
exhaustive presentation of detail. Following a discussion of the phys-
iologic signiﬁcance of acids, bases, and the pH scale, mechanisms
regulating pH will be considered as a basis for understanding the
derangements which can occur and their clinical signiﬁcance. Where
appropriate, the physiologic rationale for therapeutic measures will
be indicated as well as any signiﬁcant species peculiarities. Some
relationships between pH disturbances and other aspects of ﬂuid and
electrolyte balance will also be mentioned. As time permits, some
account will be given of methods of evaluating acid-base status includ-
ing the principles of the microelectrode techniques.

In a word association test, “drug” is unlikely to evoke a response
as simple as “salt,” “water,” or “sodium bicarbonate.” Yet the correct
balance of such humble substances is the very currency of survival,
and none is simpler or more vital than the hydrogen ion.

(38) Dehydration and Water Intoxication of Range Cattle

Thomas C. Gray, D.V.M.
Vale, Oregon

Water is one of the essentials of proper nutrition. A deprivation
of water causes a condition known as dehydration and the severity
varies .with the degree of deprivation. Prolonged dehydration can
cause irreversible damage and death. Following dehydration, uncon-
trolled access to water can cause water intoxication and death.

The US. Bureau of Land Management, through a multiphased
program of range rehabilitation, has increased the grazing capacity
of areas of the western range.

The Owyhee Butte seeding in southern Malheur county of eastern
Oregon was planted in crested wheatgrass, fenced, and a water supply
system installed. This is the only drinking water available to cattle
in that area.

In August, 1969, through a series of malfunctions, the cattle were
deprived of water for several days during the hottest part of the
summer. Five ranchers lost approximately 290 cattle either because
of dehydration or water intoxication.

Since that time, the survivors have been under surveillance to
determine what aftereffects may occur.

(40) Professional Liability in Large Animal Practice
Jack R. Dinsmore. D.V.M.

Chicago, Illinois

The increasing number of claims related to alleged malpractice
is a cause of great concern for all veterinarians. In large animal prac-
tice, the loss of a registered or purebred animal will prompt a law
suit of substantial size. The problem with a law suit that veterinarians
lose sight of is that the defense may cost as much or more than the
value of the suit. Liability insurance coverage protects the veteri-
narian by providing money for claims investigation and for legal
defense as is necessary.

The veterinarian engaged in equine practice is particularly vul-
nerable to expensive law suits by owners of horses that have proved
value as race horses or breeding animals. Many claims in horse prac-
tice are ﬁled by wealthy owners that are familiar with the legal status
of professional liability and are only too anxious to pursue a claim
that has meant substantial ﬁnancial loss to them.

Human injuries related to handling difﬁcult animals have become
a part of the liability insurance picture, because it is in this category
that the potential of a large claim is always present. Claims paid for
human injuries have increased in the last several years.

(4|) Ultrasound in Diagnosis

Ross E. D. Brown. MD.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma

By adapting the techniques of sonar and radar, high frequency,
low energy ultrasound may be used to delve into the body and map
out anatomic tissue interfaces. The correlation of the position of
these interfaces with other means of interface identiﬁcation has
opened up a ﬁeld of diagnosis which is advancing with meteoritic
speed. In 1963, there were only 2 or 3 diagnostic ultrasound pro-
cedures Widely accepted; in 1970 this number has increased to over 25.

All anatomic divisions of the body can be examined. The proce-
dures which are carried out are:

. Nervous system—echoencephalography, echoventriculography,
transdural ranging, intracranial pulsatile studies.

Urogenital system—assessment of kidney size, inspection of kidney
masses, bladder volume measurements, evaluation of prostate size,
detection of intrauterine life, placental localization, diagnosis of mul-
tiple pregnancy, diagnosis of hydatidiform mole, fetal-heart monitoring
during labor, assessment of pelvic masses.

Digestive system—hepatic scanning, detection of gallbladder calculi.

Hemic and lymphatic system—splenic scanning for size, assessment
of retroperitoneal periaortic lymph nodes.

Cardiovascular system—detection of pericardial effusion, diagnosis
of cardiac valvular disease, measurement of cardiac wall thickness,

J. W. JudyI Jr.. D.V.M.. Ph.D.: and W. W. Kirldnam. D.V.M.. PhD.
Lafayette, Indiana

Initial experiences with calves sold through auction markets in
southern Indiana showed a reduction in postshipment respiratory
disease when calves were vaccinated for infectious bovine rhinotra-
cheitis and bovine virus diarrhea at least two weeks prior to shipment.

Preshipment vaccination for IBR-BVD-PIa of cattle moved directly
from ranch to feedlot did not result in improved gains or feed
efﬁciency in the feedlot.

The cost of vaccination has varied from $1.05 to $3.08 per head
depending mainly upon availability of handling facilities.

Preshipment vaccination is gaining greatest acceptance in direct
rancher-to-feedlot sales and in smaller specialty auction sales.

pasturing 100 steers divided equally with treatments of (1) grass, (2)
grass-legume mixture, (3) alfalfa, and (4) alfalfa, were used in experi-
ments in 1969 to compare the pounds of beef that could be produced
on the different treatments.

The pastures were subdivided to allow rotational grazing. The cat-
tle were allocated fresh pasture daily then rotated for 25 days before
returning to the original area. Bloat was controlled with poloxalene
mixed with grain in a pellet. All treatments received 1 lb. of grain
except A-3 and B-4. They received 4 lb. of grain daily. Pasture A
produced 1,608, 1,208, and 1,685 lb. of beef per acre, respectively,
with a net return per acre including labor and interest on investment
of $163.95, $76.43, and $87.35, respectively. Pasture B produced 660,
850, 1,141, and 1,302 lb. of beef per acre, respectively, with a net
return of $27.65, $66.67, $211.48, and $173.08 per acre, respectively.
The alfalfa pastures produced a net return of $100.00 more per acre
in A than grass and alfalfa or in grass only in B.

(44) Endotoxin Shock and Colibacillosis

Kenneth A. Larson. D.V.M.. Ph.D.
Fort Collins, Colorado

Colibacillosis in calves can be observed in several forms ranging
from peracute to chronic. Current therapy varies with the severity
and is symptomatic in nature. Peracute cases are often accompanied
by profound shock, probably due to the release of endotoxins from
gram-negative bacteria. Since these calves may die suddently, early
treatment is necessary to reverse the shock syndrome. A brief View
of endotoxins and their mechanism of producing shock is presented
which may aid in understanding the disease syndrome and provide
a rational basis for therapy.

(45) Bovine Inhalation Anesthesia
Charles E. Short. D.V.M.

Columbia, Missouri

The use of inhalation anesthesia in bovine animals has been con-
sidered to be an undesirable technique. It has been found that the
bovine response to inhalation anesthesia is controllable and can
produce desirable depth of anesthesia with minimal undesirable
features.

The methodology of inhalation anesthesia in the cow is discussed,
along with the physiologic responses such as blood pressure, blood
gases, pH, heart and respiratory rates, plus recovery patterns. The
unique aspects of inhalation anesthesia in cattle are illustrated as
well as complications and their control.

The techniques used in both the calf and adult are discussed
because the problem of rumen hypertension (bloat) is minimal in the
young calf but may be critical in the adult.

Equipment aids such as the laryngoscope, through ease of intuba-
tion, have been of value during induction and maintenance of inha-
lation anesthesia. Both intravenous and mask induction techniques
have been used. '

(46) Accelerated Lambing and Related Programs
A. D. Leman, D.V.M.. M.S.: P. J. Dziuk. Ph.D.: B. B. Doane. M.S.

Urbana, Illinois

By inducing ovulation in the anestrous season and synchronizing
estrus during the normal breeding season, an attempt was made in
2 ﬂocks to reduce the lambing interval to 8 months. The Rambouillet
ﬂock, which averaged 1.24 lambs weaned per ewe per year over 17
years of conventional lambing, has weaned 1.82 lambs per ewe per
year under 6 years of accelerated conditions. The Hampshire ﬂock,
which averaged 1.21 lambs, has weaned 1.48 lambs per ewe per year
over a 3-year period. Purebred ewes of several breeds in 39 ﬂocks
totaling 1,317, were induced to ovulate during March, April, May,
or June and 78% (1,031) of these ewes were marked by rams. Of
these ewes 33% (432) produced 572 live lambs. Lambs born after a
summer pregnancy were often smaller than other lambs. Ram fer-
tility as measured by percentage of conception ranged from O to 100.
Ram fertility varied markedly within several ﬂocks. Estrus was
synchronized by subcutaneous progesterone implants applied 12 to
16 days. Ovulation was induced by pregnant mare’s serum gonado-
tropin injected after progesterone withdrawal.

(47) Pathology of Bovine Uterine Adenocarcinoma

George Migaki. D.V.M.; F. M. Garner. D.V.M.; A. M. Carey. D.V.M.;
R. V. Turnquest. D.V.M.
Washington, D.C., and Beltsville, Maryland

Adenocarcinoma of the uterus is one of the most common carci-
nomas in the domestic cow. This report is based on a review of 192
cases found in old cows slaughtered at federally inspected abattoirs.
Clinical signs were usually absent except for dyspnea in a few cases.
The general health of the animal was judged poor to fair in over
half of the cases.

At necropsy, the primary neoplastic lesion in the uterine wall was
relatively small and sclerotic, whereas the metastatic lesions were large,
hard, and varied in color from white to yellow, some containing
caseous and calciﬁed foci. The regional lymph nodes, especially the
internal iliac, were consistently affected; the lungs and the respiratory
lymph nodes had metastases in a high percentage of the cases. Other
organs and tissue structures were less commonly affected.

Microscopically, the outstanding ﬁnding was the predominance
of dense collagenous connective tissue supporting tubular and acinar
structures formed by the neoplastic cells. The origin of the neoplasm
appears to be the epithelial cells of the deep uterine glands.

Large Animals—Third Equine Session

(48) Pleasure Horse Practice
Elmer B. Powell. Jr.. D.V.M.

Scottsdale, Arizona

Today, the average American family, by reason of increased in-
come and more leisure time, has made the horse business a $7 to $12
billion economic force.

Veterinarians are fast discovering that pleasure horses are far
more than a passing fad.

The average pleasure horse OWner does not clearly understand the
care and handling of his horse; therefore, he relies upon his veter-
inarian for guidance and advice.

If we, as veterinarians, are to fulﬁll our responsibilities to these
horse owners, we must ﬁrst create conﬁdence in our professional abil-
ity and insure a personal interest in their problems. Unlike the vet-
erinarian who conducts an exclusive race horse practice or manages
a breeding farm, our service must deal with many facets. Each client
is an individual with a different set of needs and problems.

You must plan a well-rounded health program for the pleasure
horse owner. Explain how tetanus, inﬂuenza, and virus encephalo-
myelitis can be prevented by proper vaccination. Suggest a good
nutritional program based on the type, age, sex, and use of the horse.
Help him plan for a good stable and corral. Demonstrate proper hoof
and leg care, explain the need for periodic worm examinations and
dental care.

These are a few of the challenges you who have a pleasure horse
practice must face. They require lots of thought, patience, and good
common sense.

(49) Wound Management in Horses

John W. Britton. D.V.M.
Oakdale, California

Wound healing of the lower leg of the horse is complicated be-

 

cause of circulatory inadequacies, excessive movement of the parts,
and the severe gaping caused by inelasticity of the area. Wounds of
the foot and pastern in the front leg and of the hock in the hind
leg are most commonly encountered. Lower leg wounds require sur-
gical debridement, pressure bandages, and a course of intramuscular
antibiotic therapy after an initial prophylactic tetanus antitoxin in-
jection. Meticulous attention must be paid to the healing process and
complications attended to at once. In contrast, wounds of the body
and upper legs require little more than intramuscular antibiotic
therapy after initial debridement and tetanus antitoxin administration.

(50) The Concentrations of Corticosteroids in the Plasma
of Normal and Diseased Horses

Glen F. Hoffsis. D.V.M.. M.S.. and Philip W. Murdick. D.V.M.I PhD.
Columbus, Ohio

The concentrations of corticosteroid (cortisol and corticosterone)
in the plasma of horses was determined by competitive protein-binding
analysis (radiostereoassay) . The mean concentration of the two
steroids in the plasma of normal resting horses was 5.12 ug./100 ml,
with a standard deviation of 1.67 Mg. There were no signiﬁcant dif-
ferences in the mean values according to age, sex, and pregnancy.
Seemingly, diurnal variation in concentrations of the steroids existed
in horses; values were high in the morning and low in the evening.

Graded dosages of ACTH and dexamethasone were given to normal
horses, and the amount and duration of change in the concentration
of corticosteroids was recorded. An adrenal cortical function test is
proposed based on the increase in concentration of corticosteroids
after ACTH is given. The concentration of corticosteroids in the plasma
were measured in horses with fractures, during parturition, with
acute colic, in shock, and with chronic debilitating diseases. The
clinical applications of these ﬁndings are emphasized.

(52) Veterinary Medicine at the Racetracks
Alan H. Edmondson. D.V.M.

Pasadena, California

Opportunities and possible pitfalls of a racetrack practice will be
discussed as will the proper type of training for this rather special-

ized practice.
The second part of the paper concerns the duties and responsi—

bilities of the 3 types of racetrack practices, and the individuals to
whom the veterinarian is responsible for reports.

Rules and regulations of the racetrack, including a discussion of
prohibited drugs and the ethics of a racetrack practice, conclude the

report.

(53) Clinical and Pathologic Aspects of Russian
Knapweed Poisoning in Horses (Nigropallidal
Encephalomalacia)

Stuart Young. Ph.D.. D.V.S.M.: W. W. Brown, D.V.M.:
Bruno Klinger. M.A.

Fort Collins, Colorado

Russian knapweed (Centaurea repens L.) is a perennial plant
widely distributed in the western United States and related botanically
to yellow start thistle (Centaurea solstitialis L.). The- plant may be
consumed by horses of any age under certain conditions of manage-
ment, and there is some evidence that individual horses may develop

a preference for it. Spontaneously occurring examples of poisoning
of horses in western Colorado and eastern Utah have been observed,
and the clinical neurologic signs of the disease have been reproduced
in experimental feeding trials. The signs are sudden in onset and
include impairment of prehensility and masticulation of food, difﬁ-
culty in drinking, characteristic changes in attitude, and incoordina—
tion and confusion.

Experimental feeding conditions leading to Russian knapweed
poisoning are described. The Characteristic clinical features induced
experimentally in horses and the gross lesions of acute, selective
necrosis of certain brain stem nuclei are illustrated. Botanical charac-
teristics by which the plant may be recognized and identiﬁed are
presented.

(54) Clinical Observation of the Feline Urologic
Syndrome
Robert Taussig. M.S.. D.V.M.

Manhattan, Kansas

A survey of 300 clinical cases of the feline urinary disease known
as cystitis, urolithiasis, or urethral obstruction is presented with a
discussion of etiology and therapy. Some conclusions of the survey
reveal a high incidence of the disease in cats fed a certain type of
cat food; a large percentage of female cats with the disease than
heretofore reported; a low incidence of bacterial infection; a lower
urinary pH than was anticipated, with a corresponding lack of use-
fulness of the urinary acidifying drugs. An experimental study on
normal cats was conducted, demonstrating a comparison of the efﬁ-
cacy of certain urinary acidifying drugs and antispasmodic drugs.
The response of normal cats to urinary acidifying drugs is also
recorded. A method of handling the urinary crisis of urethral ob-

struction is discussed, along with a method of treatment to prevent ’
relapse.

(55) The Allergic Patient: A Clinical Challenge

Edward Baker. V.M.D.
Englewood, New Jersey

Specialization in allergy problems is not a ﬁeld for the casual clini-
cian. Rather, it requires a special interest and the development of
special skills not unlike that needed by other veterinary clinical sub-
specialities. It is essential that one develop a rational procedure for

l23

 

 




 

preparing a proper patient workup. Skin testing must never be
attempted until a careful technique has been developed and a reason-
able number of test sites have been observed. Reaction sites are not
always clear cut and only experience can provide the background
for classifying a reaction as positive or negative. It is important to
consider the age of onset, seasonal variation in clinical signs, and
distribution of lesions in arriving at a diagnosis. Treatment is
dependent on cause, which may include foods, parasites, environ-
mental allergens, inhalants, and chemicals, and consists of avoidance
where possible, hyposensitization when proper antigens are available,
and drugs where necessary.

(56) Patellar Luxation‘ Repair by Prosthetic Ligaments
and Trochleoplasty

Donald L. Piermattei. D.V.M.. PhD.
St. Paul, Minnesota

For a medial luxation, a lateral parapatellar skin incision is used.
Fascia lata is incised to expose the gastrocnemius muscle, and a double
strand of medium to heavy vetaﬁl suture is passed between the femur
and the lateral fabella and back out around the fabella. The joint
is opened on the medial side to allow deepening of the trochlear groove
by a ﬁle, a rongeur, or an air turbine drill. One strand of the preplaced
suture is anchored around the patella, and the other through the tibial
tubercle. They are both tied with appropriate tension to stabilize the
patella and to prevent medial rotation of the tibia.

(57) Flea Collar Dermatitis in Animals

George H. Muller. D.V.M.
Walnut Creek, California

Flea collar dermatitis of dogs and cats is a contact dermatitis
caused by wearing an organophosphate-impregnated plastic collar.
The occurrence and degree of severity depends on individual sus-
ceptibility. Whereas some animals have worn these collars for years
without apparent harm, others show irritation soon after the collar
is strapped on the neck.

The skin lesions begin with erythema and mild itching in the
area under the ﬂea collar. The extreme dorsal and ventral points
are the ﬁrst affected and often the most severely damaged areas in
advancing cases. If the collar is not removed, the irritation increases
until erythematous, excoriated pruritic patches develop not only under
the collar but also, in some cases, along the entire back and head.
Complicating secondary bacterial infection and severe generalized
toxicity has been observed. Even after removal of the collar, hyper-
pigmentation, ﬂaking, and scaling remain for several months.

Flea collar dermatitis occurs with increasing frequency and most
small animal practitioners are now treating the disease regularly. It
is not yet clear if and how the condition can be prevented, but nu-
merous methods have already been advocated. Treatment includes
the use of systemic and topical corticosteroids and antibiotics.

Robert M. Nims. D.V.M.: Jerry S. Walker. D.V.M.. M.S.
Washington, D.C., and Frederick, Maryland

Tropical canine pancytopenia is a newly recognized disease of
dogs in diverse tropical and subtropical areas. The disease has been
responsible for the death of large numbers of military dogs in South-
east Asia. Dogs are often presented with unilateral or bilateral
epistaxis which is the most dramatic clinical sign of the disease.
Coagulation time and prothrombin time are normal; however, bleed-
ing time is prolonged. Affected dogs develop severe anemia, leukope-
nia, and thrombocytopenia. A large number of dogs with similar
hematologic signs become progressively debilitated and die without
manifesting overt epistaxis.

Necropsy ﬁndings consist of lymphadenopathy and petechial and
ecchymotic hemorrhages on serosal and mucosal surfaces of numerous
organs and in subcutaneous tissues. The most prominent histologic
ﬁnding is a perivascular plasma cell inﬁltrate in numerous organs.

Laboratory dogs inoculated with fresh blood from affected dogs
from different geographic areas developed disease consistent with
Tropical Canine Pancytopenia. Cytoplasmic inclusions similar to
those described for Ehrlichia canis have been demonstrated in mono-
nuclear cells in peripheral blood smears and in impression smears
prepared from tissue of naturally and experimentally infected dogs.

Heavy tick infestations have been associated with epizootics of
the d1sease. Treatment of the disease has not been resolved.

(60) Restraint ot Monkeys in Clinical Examination
and Treatment

Norman H. Altman. V.M.D.
Baltimore, M aryhznd

Monkeys can inﬂict severe injuries to veterinarians and owners
during medical examination and treatment if not properly handled.
In addition, the possible transmission of zoonotic infections dictates
that the utmost care be utilized. Small monkeys can be restrained
by h01ding the monkey’s forearms behind its back with one hand
and stretching its legs ﬁrmly with the. other hand. For detailed
clinical examination and treatment, chemical restraint is required.
The drug of choice is phencyclidine HCl which is an analgesic, seda-
tive, and an anesthetic agent and can be administered orally, intra-
muscularly, or intravenously. An injection of 0.5 mg./kg. of body
weight will produce tranquilization in 5 to 10 minutes. Light
surgical anesthesia can be induced with 1.5 to 3.5 mg./kg. body weight.
There is a wide margin of safety with phencyclidine HCl. Adequate
sedation can also be achieved with phenothiazine-derived tranquilizers
at the recommended dosages for dogs.

(6|) Computer as an Aid to Veterinary Medical
Practice

Eugene L. Kirshbaum. D.V.M.
Las Vegas, Nevada

We are all familiar with the computer as used for billing. In our
practice we have expanded the use of the computer to aid us in
other ofﬁce functions as well as helping us to evaluate the exact
character of our practice.

We utilize the computer to do our billing, send reminder cards,
and complete breakdown of diagnoses—age groups of our patients,
sex, breed, and percentage of dogs to cats. We also use the computer
to give us a complete breakdown as to where our income is derived
as regards to professional fee, immunization, medicine given, medicine
dispensed, anesthesia, surgery, laboratory, x-ray, hospitalization, and
miscellaneous.

The purpose of this paper will be to Show that full utilization of
a computer’s capability will: (1) save us money in our practice;
(2) make us money in our practice; and (3) give us a complete proﬁle
of our practice, enabling us to adjust our skills to ﬁt the needs
of our patients.

(62) Application of a Modified Robert Jones Dressing

R. Bruce Hohn. D.V.M.. M.S.
Columbus, Ohio

The modiﬁed Robert Jones dressing is a heavily padded cotton
supportive dressing used primarily or postoperatively on limbs in
which tissue trauma has been severe or there is marked vascular im-
pairment and swelling. It is a safe type of immobilization but is
designed especially for hospital use, since ambulation with this bulky
dressing is restricted. The dressing is comfortable and animals will
only rarely chew at it.

(64) Problems in Treating Congestive Heart Failure in Dogs
Robert R. Pensinger, M.S.. D.V.M.

Boston, Massachusetts

Congestive heart failure is often difficult to treat. We know that
mitral valve disease becomes progressively severe with the aging dog,
but the failure of the heart may be related to chronic changes of the
myocardium and coronary vasculature. We do not know the etiology
of the disease, nor can we reverse the chronic disease process. Fluid
and electrolyte balance studies have proved the value of dietary con-
trol of sodium and protein in all stages of heart disease in the dog.
However, treatment often begins after severe myocardial hypertrophy
develops. In addition, there is a tendency to generalize our treatment
of congestive heart failure, but experience dictates careful assessment
of each individual case. Furthermore, the signs of congestive heart
failure may be confused with other medical problems. We have at-

I26

   

 

 

 

 
 

  




tempted to establish a systematic method of assessing the advance-
ment of heart disease in dogs.

Another major problem is the difﬁculty experienced in the effective
use of digitalis glycosides. Inaccurate dosages are sometimes used;
an inadequate dose will not give the desired therapeutic effect, and
an excessive dose often causes toxic signs. Thus, the therapeutic zone
between effectiveness and digitoxicity is critical, especially in the

01.” geriatric patient. Methods are being developed to assess digitalis

S m tolerance in the individual animal with heart disease.

not Thus, we have developed a better understanding of congestive
heart failure and its treatment, but many improvements are necessary

:3: in an aging canine population. It is not difﬁcult to understand that

similar therapeutic problems exist in human beings with congestive

,ute; heart .failure and that these problems have been the emphasis of
[Xe investlgations in man and dog. Recent efforts have been made to
“mg develop comparative studies in our clinic and laboratories in the hope
an that treatment of heart disease will continue to improve.

(66) Anomalous Angle Glaucoma in the Basset Hound
Milton Wyman, D.V.M.I M.S.
:on Columbus, Ohio
1n Of 59 Basset Hounds whose angles were examined, 69% had

defects of various degrees. The defects have been previously described
k as mesodermal dysgenesis of the angle. The congenital defect appears
y to have a genetic predisposition from our initial data; however, this
has not been conﬁrmed. Reference is made to the anomalous angle
and .ltS predisposition to zonular defects and lens luxation, either
partial or complete. The incidence of overt glaucoma was less than
10% of the dogs examined. Histologic sections conﬁrm the abnormal
l5 angles which were observed grossly. Medical and surgical treatment
is outlined for the disease as it occurs in the Basset Hound.

1t (67) Lembert Suture Technique for Ruptured
Cruciate Ligaments

Phillip T. Pearson. ID.V.M.. Ph.D.

Ames, Iowa

'nmmmgw

A modiﬁed Lembert suture technique has been used at Iowa State
University for over three years with good results. This technique
requires a 4 to 5 inch vertical incision just lateral to the patella,
straight patellar ligament, and tibial crest. Any remaining portions
of the ruptured cruciate ligaments are removed and the menisci are
examined for evidence of injury.

 

I27

 

 




 

The stiﬂe joint capsule and lateral femoropatellar fascia are closed
with heat sterilized vet-a-ﬁl sutures. Next, 10 to 15 Lembert sutures
are placed in the lateral muscle fascia. The ﬁrst bites of the sutures
are placed one-third of the distance from the anterior border of the
joint and the second bite just lateral to the lateral edges of the patella
and straight patellar ligament. All sutures are positioned before they
are tied.

To provide additional stability, an additional 3 to 4 Lembert
sutures are placed on both the lateral and medial sides of the stiﬂe
joint. The surgery is completed with subcutaneous fascia and skin
sutures.

(69) Needle Biopsy of the Kidney and Liver in the Dog

Carl A. Osborne. D.V.M.
St. Paul, Minnesota

The need for diagnostic speciﬁcity and the fact that morphologic
alterations constitute the principal criteria for classifying most renal
and hepatic diseases has contributed to the value of kidney and liver
biopsy in the clinical evaluation of patients with renal and hepatic
disorders.

In order to consistently obtain satisfactory kidney or liver speci-
mens via needle biopsy, without serious risk to the patient, adequate
localization and immobilization of the kidney or liver, together with
rational planning of the site and direction of needle puncture are
essential. A small paralumbar incision facilitates immobilization of
the kidney and allows satisfactory renal biopsy specimens to be ob-
tained with a biopsy needle without undue risk to the patient. Sim-
ilarly, a small midline incision facilitates immobilization of the liver
and allows satisfactory biopsy specimens to be obtained with a biopsy
needle without undue risk to the patient.

(7|) Electroencephalographic "Seizures" in Anesthetized
Dogs with Neurologic Diseases

W. R. Klemm. D.V.M.. Ph.D.. and C. L. Hall. D.V.M.
College Station, Texas

This paper is based on electroencephalogram (EEG) data taken
primarily from 80 anesthetized dogs that were referred to the Texas
A&M Veterinary Clinic because they had a history of convulsions.
Seizure criteria were arbitrary, but relatively speciﬁc. The ﬁndings
revealed that: (1) EEG seizures were of a variety of forms, (2) EEG
seizures occurred during anesthesia without the otherwise expected
motor accompaniment, (3) apparent EEG seizures occurred in some
dogs which had no known history of convulsions, (4) the majority
of the convulsive dogs did not have EEG seizures, but 79 of 80 had
conspicuous EEG abnormality of one sort or another, (5) the only
evidence of idiopathic epilepsy was in 3 littermates, and (6) a variety
of organic neurologic diseases was diagnosed.

(75) Idiopathic Cardiomyopathy in the Dog

Stephen Ettinger. D.V.M.: Gary R. Bolton. D.V.M.;
Peter F. Lord. B.V.Sc.. M.R.C.V.S.
New York, New York

Cardiac dilatation and biventricular heart failure are the out-
standing features of idiopathic cardiomyopathy, and atrial ﬁbrillation
appears consistently. The clinical syndrome is most often recognized
in young adult dogs of larger breeds, usually from 2 to 8 years of
age. As with other conditions causing atrial ﬁbrillation, the male
is more often affected than is the female.

Clinically, signs of heart failure develop rapidly, and signs of
right heart failure usually predominate early in the disease. Ascites,
generalized weight loss, and venous distention are prominent signs.
A cardiac cough and signs of left heart failure develop subsequently.

Treatment with digitalis glycosides to slow the heart rate and
improve cardiac performance is often helpful in the early phases of
the syndrome. However, long-term therapy has been unsuccessful
even after electrical cardioversion has restored a normal sinus rhythm
and maintenance therapy with digitalis glycosides has been employed.

Cardiac dilatation with dilatation of the mitral and tricuspid
anular rings results in mitral and tricuspid insufﬁciency. Grossly,
the .valve leaﬂets and chordae tendineae appear normal. Histologic
sections from the ventricles suggest the presence of ﬁbrosis; however,

this is neither consistent nor pathognomonic for idiopathic cardio-
myopathy.

Small Animals—Third Session

(76) Diagnosis of Renal Disease: Interpretation of
Laboratory Tests

Carl A. Osborne. D.V.M.
St. Paul, Minnesota

Urinalyses, concentration tests, blood urea nitrogen, serum

creatlnlne, and phen'olsulfonphthalein excretion are practical diagnostic
procedures which are clinically useful in the diagnosis of renal
dlseases. Single determinations of most renal function tests indicate
the functional competence of the kidneys at the time the tests are
performed, but do not indicate the etiology of the disease, the acute-
ness or chronicity‘ of the underlying lesions, or the degree of re-
versibility or irreversibility of the lesions. Because single determina-
tions of renal function tests are of limited diagnostic and prognostic
value, renal function should be re-evaluated at appropriate intervals
in order to establish the trend of abnormal renal function. Detection
of remission or exacerbation of abnormal renal function by serially
performed function tests often provides a reliable index with which
to establish a prognosis or determine efﬁcacy of treatment.

(77) Facts and Artitacts in the Microscopic
Examination of Urine Specimens

B. L. Glenn. D.V.M.. Ph.D.
Stillwater, Oklahoma

Microscopic examination of urine sediment is an essential part
of the urinalysis in evaluation of renal and postrenal urinary tract
disease. The technique for preparation of both stained and unstained
specimens of urine sediment for microscopic examination will be
reviewed.

Various types and forms of cells, casts, crystals, amorphous ma-
terial, and artifacts commonly encountered in urine sediment will be
illustrated. The interpretation and diagnostic signiﬁcance of various
features of the urine sediment will be discussed.

(78) Clinical Significance of Plasma Protein Concentrations
Oscar W. Schalm. D.V.M.. PhD.

Davis, California

Total plasma protein is readily deternirned, using less than a drop
of plasma from the capillary hematocrit tube. A hand refractometer
is used. Normal range for total plasma protein is 6.0 to 7.5 Gm. /
100 ml. for dogs and cats. The newborn animal commonly has less
than 6.0 Gm. / 100 ml. for the ﬁrst few weeks of life, and aged dogs
and cats may have 8.0 Gm./ 100 m1. due to the increase in the globulin
fraction with advancing age. Thus, age is a factor to be taken into
consideration when interpreting results. Albumin and ﬁbrinogen are
produced by the liver; the globulins are produced by lymphocytic
tissues. Loss of liver function, hemorrhage, chronic gastrointestinal
disease, inadequate nutrition, and lymphosarcoma commonly result
in low plasma protein values. Response to antigens, as in chronic
infectious diseases, increases gamma globulin which is reﬂected in a
rise in total plasma protein. Contraction of the spleen in excitable
dogs increases the erythrocyte concentration in blood (PCV) signiﬁ-
cantly which on the basis of the PCV value alone may suggest hemo-
concentration. An elevated PCV but normal total plasma protein value
suggest splenic contraction, whereas high PCV and plasma protein
values suggest hemoconcentration from dehydration. Results of hy-
drating a dog or cat can be readily visualized by following the changes
produced in plasma protein concentration. The plasma must be clear
for accurate estimation of total plasma protein. Free hemoglobin from
hemolysis or a lipemic plasma will increase the refractive index of
plasma and result in an erroneously high plasma protein prediction.
An above normal icterus index does not affect the result.

lymphoma requires correlation of physical and hematologic examina-
tions and lymph node biopsy. Early clinical signs are usually enlarge-
ment of peripheral lymph nodes and occasionally splenomegaly and
tonsillar enlargement. Late manifestations are variable depending on
organs involved and may include anemia, fever, and weight loss.
Hematologically, nonspeciﬁc leukocytosis often occurs; however
frank leukemia develops in less than 50% of all dogs. Circulating
malignant cells are usually fragile lymphoblasts which frequently
distort to form basket or smudge cells. Lymphadenopthy and leuko-
cytosis also occur in non-neoplastic diseases such as systemic mycotic
infections, toxoplasmosis, septicemia, and atypical reticulum cell hyper-
plasias. Lymph node biopsy should therefore be performed to estab-
lish the correct diagnosis and in lymphomas to determine the cell
type. An involved node should be selected and carefully removed with
the capsule intact. Touch imprints from the cut surface will aid the
pathologist in diagnosis. Accurate clinical and cytologic diagnosis of
lymphoma is a prerequisite to rational prognosis and therapy.

(8i) Diagnosis of Parasitic Diseases in Blood

paras1tes and other diseases which can be diagnosed in blood will be
presented. Special aspects of technique will be presented. Artifacts
Wthh may lead to mistakes in diagnosis as well as special features
of the stained blood smear helpful in evaluating the disease will be
discussed.

Blood parasites and other organisms to be studied will include
Babesza, Hemobartonella, microﬁlaria, Ehrlichia, and H istoplasma.

(82) Myeloproliferative Diseases in the Cat Associated
with C-Type Leukovirus Particles in Bone Marrow
Oscar W. Schalm. D.V.M.. Ph.D.. and G. H. Theilen. D.V.M.

Davis, California

The pluripotential stem cell of the bone marrow gives rise to
several cell lines. Myeloproliferative disease results when one or
more cell lines undergoes a maturation defect leading to failure to
Produce functional deﬁnitive cells. Erythremic myelosis results when
abnormal maturation is limited to the erythrocytic series. Granulo-
cytic leukemia is the end result when the granulocytic series is in-
volved. In some instances, both erythrocytic and granulocytic cell
lines undergo abnormal maturation producing erythroleukemia. Re-
ticuloendotheliosis is an appropriate designation when the proliferating
cell is too immature to be identiﬁed with a recognizable cell line.

Myeloproliferative diseases in the cat are characterized by rapid
wasting and profound irreversible anemia. Hepatomegaly, spleno-
megaly, and lymphadenopathy are also frequent ﬁndings. Terminally,
myeloﬁbrosis may develop and be associated with extramedullary

|3l

 

 




hematopoiesis in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. The myelopro-
liferative diseases can usually be differentiated from the more com-
monly occurring lymphocytic leukemia.

C-type leukovirus has been found by electron microscopy with
considerable regularity in bone marrow cells of cats with myelopro-
liferative diseases. This ﬁnding strongly implicates the C-type leuko-
virus as the causal agent. The possible viral etiology, similar to the
feline leukemia virus, abnormal proliferation of hematopoietic cells,
inﬁltrations in visceral organs, and terminal nature suggest placing
the myeloproliferative diseases of cats within the feline leukemia-
sarcoma complex.

(83) Laboratory Medicine in Small Animal Practice:
Component or Adiunct?

Walter F. Loeb. V.M.D.. M.Sc.. PhD.
Columbus, Ohio

The increased need for, and use of, laboratory determinations
in veterinary practice presents the veterinarian with a new problem.
Shall he establish or develop his own ofﬁce laboratory or use the
services of a large commercial laboratory? The criteria by which the
practitioner can resolve this to meet the needs of his own practice
will be discussed. Consideration will be given to species variations
and their implications on analytical methodology. Methods by which
the veterinarian can evaluate an outside laboratory he wishes to
utilize will be described. Some evaluation of “rapid” and “kit”
methods for clinical chemistry will be presented. In light of the
current concepts of presymptomatic diagnosis, suggestions will be
made for meeting one’s laboratory needs by a blend of analyses per-
formed by a high-volume commercial laboratory and analyses per-
formed in the veterinarian’s ofﬁce laboratory.

(84) An Evaluation of Serum Amylase and Lipase in
Experimentally Induced Pancreatitis in the Dog

Duane F. Brobst. D.V.M.. Ph.D.: A. B. Ferguson. B.V.Sc.. B.Agr.:
J. M. Carter. D.V.M.. PhD.
Lafayette, Indiana

It is generally believed that in acute pancreatitis hyperamylasemia
occurs within a few hours after onset and returns to normal within
2 to 6 days. Likewise it is thought serum lipase becomes elevated
several hours after amylase and remains elevated after amylase has
returned to normal.

The purpose of this investigation was the simultaneous measure-
ment of serum amylase and lipase during the course of experimen-
tally induced pancreatitis in the dog. Pancreatitis was induced in 6
dogs by injecting carbon tetrachloride into the parenchyma of the
gland or by injecting bile or chyme into a pancreatic duct. Measure-
ments of serum amylase and lipase were performed simultaneously
until the enzyme levels became normal. In 5 of the 6 dogs, signiﬁcant
elevations of serum amylase and lipase were observed, and the levels

were elevated for as long as 12 days. In the comparative analysis it
was found that serum amylase and lipase parallel each other during
all phases of the disease. Contrary to an existing point of view, serum
lipase elevation did not persist longer than the elevation of serum
amylase.

(86) Practical Radiologic Equipment tor Small
Animal Practice

Robert B. Barrett. D.V.M.
Athens, Georgia

Radiograph machines are available in a variety of sizes, outputs,
and. designs. While the practitioner has the option of leasing or
buying new or used equipment, he needs some guidelines to aid in
dec1ding which of the many units will be most acceptable and useful
in his particular type of practice. Further, the basic requirements
necessary for producing radiographs of diagnostic quality must be
defined before the veterinarian can decide his own needs for speciﬁc
1' adJOIQgiC equipment and ancillary accessories.

Thls presentation will discuss the various types of radiologic
eqmpment suitable for small animal practice and will consider a
number of ancillary radiologic accessories that are necessary to produce
rad10graphs of diagnostic quality. Comments will be made concerning
the deating of older machines and the place of the darkroom in
maklng good radiographs.

 

(87) Practical Contrast Mediums Used in Radiographic
Examination of the Urogenital System

Claud D. Evans. D.V.M.I and Ellis M. Hall. D.V.M.. PhD.
Tuskegee, Alabama

Positive and negative contrast agents are compared in their utility
in diagnosis of conditions of the urogenital system. Negative contrast
mediums used were air, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. Although carbon
dioxide is absorbed faster than air or oxygen, the advantages of air
from an availability point of view seem to outweigh the advantages
of carbon dioxide. Positive contrast mediums compared were methyl-
glucalnine diatrizoate and iodopyracet.

Negative contrast mediums (gas) have several advantages over
positive contrast agents when examining the urinary bladder, except
in cases where radiolucent stones are present. It also has merit in
identifying extrinsic masses of the urogenital system. Positive con-
trast agents, however, must be used to evaluate kidney and ureters

with respect to function.

I33

 

 




Procedures for performing negative and positive contrast studies
of the urogenital system are simple and practical. These procedures
can be effectively performed in any clinic having reasonable radio-
graphic equipment.

(88) Transosseous Vertebral Phlebography: A
Radiographic Method of Localizing Spinal
Cord Compression in the Dog

William E. Blevins. D.V.M.; Robert B. Barrett. D.V.M.;
Robert E. Lewis. D.V.M.. M.S.

Ames, Iowa, and Athens, Georgia

Transosseous vertebral phlebography is a radiographic technique
with which spinal cord compression can be localized. Its most frequent
application is the localization of a herniated intervertebral disc. Inter-
vertebral disc lesions can be very diﬂicult, if not impossible, to localize
using conventional radiography when the herniated disc is not cal-
ciﬁed. However, by establishing the blood ﬂow pattern in the longi-
tudinal vertebral sinuses, the posterior limit of the compression can
be determined.

Thirty dogs were used in establishing the technique and deter-
mining its efﬁcacy. It was found that by injecting a radiographic
contrast medium into the body of the 7th lumbar vertebra, the venous
sinuses could be opaciﬁed from the injection site to at least the 8th
thoracic vertebra in the normal dog. If a herniated intervertebral
disc is present, the flow of contrast medium in the venous sinuses
will be interrupted. The location of the interrupted ﬂow will indicate
the location of the herniated disc.

(89) Heritability ot Canine Hip Dysplasia

C. R. Jessen. D.V.M.. Ph.D.
St. Paul, Minnesota

Canine hip dysplasia, a developmental disease, was evaluated in
the dog with respect to the reliability of the 2-year-old radiographic
phenotype to predict the individual’s breeding value. Critical evalua-
tions were made in only one breed, the German Shepherd Dog, where
radiographic phenotypic evaluations were conducted. In this study,
244 individual oﬁspring from 54 full-sib families were used. The
parental radiographic phenotypes for each full-sib family were also
evaluated.

The metric trait used in this study was an index developed from
the utilization of the linear discrimination function. The index value,
which resulted from radiographic measurements, is a measurement
of the individual’s canine hip dysplasia status with respect to normal
breed phenotype. The heritability of this metric character (the index)
was estimated utilizing several methods of computation.

(90) Thoracic Radiologic Technique

Robert B. Barrett. D.V.M.
Athens, Georgia

There are great differences in the densities of the structures that
make up the thoracic cage, as well as the respiratory and cardiovas-
cular systems. The use of radiography as a diagnostic aid is probabbly
of more value in deﬁning disorders of the thorax than elsewhere in
the body. Radiography can be used in the thorax because delicate
differences in density and form are easily recognized, even with lesions
that produce limited clinical signs. However, because this is a region
of the body where motion creates a speciﬁc problem in achieving
radiographs of diagnostic quality, good exposure technique is necessary.

The exposure techniques, equipment, and accessory devices pre-

ferred to make good quality radiographs of the thorax will be con-
s1dered in this presentation.

(9|) Veterinary Radiotherapy

Edward L. Gillette. D.V.M.. Ph.D.
Fort Collins, Colorado

Some of the basic principles of radiation therapy and methods
used to treat certain tumors of animals at Colorado State University
are discussed. Follow-up information was obtained at 6-month inter-
vals for 262 animals which had been given radiotherapy for perianal
tumors, squamous cell carcinoma, ﬁbrosarcoma, or mast cell tumors.
Results were expressed as 2-year cure rates. Radiotherapy is an
important mode of treatment of cancers in man but has not been
greatly utilized in veterinary medicine. It is a worthy addition to
the therapeutic measures for older animals, and studies of radiation
responses of animﬂ tumors could be useful in devising improved
methods of radiotherapy of tumors of animals and man.

(9IB) A Comparison of Tissue Depth Doses Using Various
X-Ray Units and a Cobalt 60 Therapy Machine

James B. Smathers. Ph.D.: W. C. Banks. D.V.M.: John Simek. M.S.
College Station, Texas

Using a frozen hindquarter of a horse which had been sliced into
slabs of uniform thickness, the absorbed dose distribution versus
depth in tissue has been compared for x-ray energies of 100 kv.p.,
150 kv.p., 200 kp.v., and 250 kp.v. versus those of cobalt 60 gammas.
Variations in the depth dose distribution and the dose rate versus
X-ray ﬁlter utilized is illustrated for several energies. The correlation
of this information with the half value layer is indicated. Dose rate
variation through the skin is illustrated for x-ray energies of interest
The dosimetric technique utilized is lithium-ﬂuoride rods, 1 mm.
in diameter and 6 mm. long. The thermoluminescent response of
the rods versus dose was obtained for each energy using NBS cali-
brated secondary standard ion chambers.
Except for the dosimeter placed on the exterior surface, all dosime-
ters were irradiated under conditions of electron equilibrium.

(92) Radiographic Evaluation of Healing Fractures:
Normal and Complicated Cases

Timothy R. O'Brien. D.V.M.. Ph.D.

Davis, California

Radiographic studies are important aids in evaluating fractures,
determining the most suitable method of repair, and studying fracture
healing. Postsurgical radiographs are necessary to evaluate the ap-
position of the fracture fragments and provide a basis for a prognosis.

Normal fracture healing will be discussed, with special emphasis
on how the method of fracture ﬁxation inﬂuences callus formation.
Complication in fracture healing, as seen radiographically, will be
discussed in depth.

(93) Endodontic Therapy For Canine Teeth in the Dog

Donald L. Ross. D.V.M.. and John W. Myers. D.V.M.
Lackland Air Force Base, Texas

Exposure of the dental pulp, due to wear or trauma, results in
pulp necrosis, bone and dentine resorption, apical abscessation, and
loss of the tooth. Human endodontic techniques have been modiﬁed
and combined into a simple, inexpensive procedure for the dog. The
ﬁlling and hermatic sealing of the root canal is the desired objective.
The durability of the procedure is ensured by surgical exposure of
the root apex (apicoectomy) , cleaning and ﬁlling the canal, and seal-
ing both ends of the canal with amalgam. The appearance and
effectiveness of the tooth is preserved and the body is spared prolonged
exposure to apical abcesses.

(94) Advances in Small Animal Anesthesiology
Charles E. Short. D.V.M.

Columbia, Missouri

Most of the recent advances in small animal anesthesiology have
been associated with the development of halothane and methoxyﬂurane
anesthesia and improvements in the available equipment for the ad-
ministration of these agents. Although these two agents are not new,
the application and understanding of them by the veterinarian is
improving.

Guidelines have been established for anesthesia and adjunct therapy
for surgery of the eye since deep anesthesia is required and often
the patient is aged and suffering from various cardiopulmonary
complications.

I36

 

 




 

Surgical procedures of the chest require positive pressure breathing,
and the responsibilities of monitoring and maintaining near normal
physiologic function are critical for successful completion of the sur-
gical procedure.

The dog or cat with pathologic complications must be given
special consideration for successful anesthetic management. Guide-
lines for these complications have been established.

The problem of anesthetic management of the small pup or kitten
with small tidal volumes can be solved through the use of inhalation
anesthesia with appropriate equipment and attention to the principles
of anesthetic management.

(95) Cardiopulmonary Dysfunction in Small Animals
During General Anesthesia

Jerry R. Gillespie, D.V.M.. Pb.D.: E. P. Stetfey. V.M.D.; P. Hawes

Davis, California

We studied the respiratory gas exchange of healthy dogs prior to

and following general anesthesia.

Chest radiographs were taken prior to and at intervals following
general anesthesia in order that we could correlate the cardiopuhnon-
ary dysfunction with radiographic changes in the lungs.

We found animals given general anesthesia develop large gradients
between the level of oxygen in their alveoli and their arterial blood
( P Aoa-P 302) .

The cause of this abnormally large PAo2-Pao2 is the result of low
ventilation to portions of the lungs which are being relatively over
perfused with blood. The large PA02-Pao2 can cause a severe hypox-
emia and eventual death. Periodic deep inspirations are beneﬁcial
in preventing the large PA02-Pao2 and thereby preventing hypoxemia.

(96) Prevention and Treatment of Acute Renal Failure
in the Canine Surgery Patient

l. M. Gary Gourley. D.V.M.. PhD.

Davis, California

Acute renal failure following trauma or surgery has been deﬁned
as a sudden depression of renal perfusion and function; usually initi-
ated by extrarenal factors. Two types of failure are recognized: (1)
functional failure, immediately reversible by correcting the precipi-
tating extrarenal factor, e.g., blood replacement in hypovolemia; and
(2) organic failure, which is not immediately reversible and is caused
by changes in the renal parenchyma. In the latter instance, the
underlying cause of the organic lesion is considered to be the occlusion
of tubules by casts.

In conjunction with surgery, renal ischemia and antidiuretic hor-
mone eﬂ’ects occurring as a result of water deprivation, the admin-
istration of narcotics or anesthetics, the hemodynamic vasoconstrictive
effects of trauma, hypotension, and blood loss result in a low volume
of concentrated urine, favorable to the precipitation of protein (casts).
The casts form in the distal or collecting tubules causing obstruction
and dilation of the tubule proximal to the cast. Dilation of the tubule

brings about a ﬂattening and destruction of the tubular epithelium,
with consequential renal shutdown.

The prevention and treatment of acute renal failure under such
circumstances is effected by (1) anticipating and recognizing the
occurrence of the phenomenon; (2) instigating water or osmotic
diuresis preoperatively, operatively, and postoperatively; and (3)
utilizing peritoneal dialysis in the oliguric or anuric animal, until
diuresis occurs.

Under conditions of renal deﬁciency, body weight (water), urine,
and blood parameters (BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, acid-base) must
be determined and evaluated for proper diagnosis and therapy.

(97) Treatment of Sialoceles by Excision of the
Salivary Glands

Charles D. Knecht. V.M.D.. M.S.

Urbana, Illinois

Diseases of the salivary glands include inﬂammation, neoplasia, and
cysts. Cysts result from rupture of the salivary ducts. Sialoceles
(salivary cysts) of the mandibular or caudal sublingual salivary
glands are best treated by surgical excision of these glands. Sialoceles
of the cranial sublingual glands may be treated by excision of these
glands, marsupialization, or drainage and cautery. Healing is more
rapid if the cysts are excised with the glands.

(98) Use of Doxapram HCl for Controlled

Respiration and Arousal
Charles E. Short. D.V.M.

Columbia, Missouri
Doxapram HCl is a potent respiratory stimulant with rapid action

and minimal side effects. Its response is primarily respiratory in
nature with a secondary increase in heart rate and blood pressure.

It has been successfully used by slow intravenous drip for main-
tenance of respiration during anesthesia in debilitated or over—anes-
thetized patients and for control of respiration and more rapid arousal
following the completion of surgery.

Difﬁculties in respiration following surgery have fallen into 2
principal groups: (1) hyperventilation resulting from artiﬁcial res-
piration with 100% O2; (2) hypoventilation resulting from too much
anesthesia or other form of depression of the patient.

Doxapram has been effective for initiation of spontaneous breath-
ing with increased depth and rate in animals representing both groups.

“03) Surgical Treatment of Osteochonclritis Dissecans
ot the Shoulder ot the Dog

Robert L. Leighton. V.M.D.

Davis, California

Surgical removal of the loose cartilage with curettement of the
lesion is recommended for treatment of well-developed, painful lesions
of osteochondritis dissecans.

A curved incision is made from the lower spine of the scapula to
the proximal humerus. The underlying fascia and omo-transversarius
muscle are incised to reveal the deltoideus which is reﬂected by
osteotomizing the acromion process. The tendon of insertion of the
infraspinatus is severed. The joint capsule is incised. The lesion is
treated. Closure is by suturing the joint capsule and tendon, and
wiring the acromion fragment. Muscle, subcutaneous tissue, and
skin are closed routinely.

(I04) Diagnosis and Surgical Treatment of
Canine Hydrocephalus

E. D. Gage. D.V.M.. M.S.
College Station, Texas

Hydrocephalus is a common neurologic disorder in the dog and
may be either congenital or acquired following infection, trauma, or
neoplasia. Since it may result in multiple clinical manifestations, the
differential diagnosis is sometimes difﬁcult in the mature dog. Special
radiographic examinations, electroencephalography, and other neuro-
logic procedures may be employed to conﬁrm the diagnosis. The most
effective and permanent treatment of hydrocephalus is surgical relief.
A technique will be described in which the cerebrospinal ﬂuid is
shunted from the dilated lateral ventricles of the brain to the right
atrium of the heart by means of a one-way valve shunt system. This
ventriculoatrial shunting procedure has been employed successfully
in over 20 dogs. The procedure is within capabilities of any small
animal practitioner and provides a successful means of treatment. If
the condition is diagnosed and treated before excessive cortical dam-
age has resulted, the prognosis is favorable.

“05) Cardiovascular Effects of Halothane and
Methoxyflurane in Miniature Swine

Donald C. Sawyer, D.V.M.. Ph.D.. and William V. Lumb. D.V.M.. Ph.D.

Fort Collins, Colorado, and San Francisco, California

Hormel miniature swine were surgically instrumented with elec-
tromagnetic ﬂow sensors around the ascending aorta, and catheters
were placed in the aorta and superior vena cava. Following a 10-day
recovery period, preanesthetic values obtained from unanesthetized,
unmedicated animals were compared with data recorded during and
following anesthesia.

At an arterial blood halothane concentration of 2.53%, equal to
an alveolar concentration of 1.1%, cardiac output and stroke volume
decreased 50.0%. Mean arterial pressure decreased 41.0% and heart
rate remained unchanged. Peripheral vascular resistance increased
14.0% and hematocrit decreased 22.0%. The Paco2 was 46 :4 torr
during anesthesia and 34 i 3 torr while awake.

Data were obtained from 10 animals during methoxyﬂurane anes-
thesia at an arterial blood concentration of 2.83% equal to an alveolar
concentration of 0.22%. Cardiac output decreased 39.0%, stroke
volume decreased 48.0%, and mean arterial pressure decreased 28.0%.
Heart rate and peripheral vascular resistance increased 20.0%, and
hematocrit decreased 14.0%. The Paco2 was 50 :I: 6 torr during anes-
thesia and 35 i 3 torr while awake.

Ease and reproducibility of measurements and similarity of re-
sponses to those found in man may make this animal useful in studies
of all anesthetic effects on the circulation.

“06) Surgical Technique for Chronic Canine Tracheostomy

East Lansing, Michigan, and San Antonio, Texas

Chronic tracheostomy in laboratory animals, especially the dog,
is a necessary and useful tool for research in respiratory function of
the conscious animal. It is also useful for the temporary or repeated
exposure of the research animal to artiﬁcial atmospheres or to air
pollution in a closed environment.

The surgical technique is simple and can be accomplished with a
minimum of time and expense. A ventral approach is made to the
anterior cervical trachea and approximately one-third of the diameter
of 3 adjacent tracheal rings removed. The edges of the skin incision
are then sutured to the tracheal rings. A cuffed tracheostomy tube
can be inserted into the conscious animal with the aid of local anes-
thesia, and the experiment then may be performed.

A surgical procedure was developed that permitted long-term
studies of renal function in the ovine fetus. Fetuses were cathe-
terized at approximately day 120 of gestation and studied through
the remainder of gestation. Homeostasis during this period depended
on continual addition of fetal urine to the amniotic ﬂuids.

Symposium: The Veterinarian and Our Environment

(I IO) Ecology and the Veterinarian

Albert W. Franzmann. D.V.M.
Moscow, Idaho

Development of the premise that the veterinarian has a role in
ecology provides a basis for discussing man’s inﬂuence on ecosystems
and the importance of ecological thinking applied to all phases of
man’s activity. Veterinary medical research can and should contribute
to the advancement of knowledge necessary for us to better under-
stand the Earth’s ecosystems. Implementation of present and future
environmental knowledge is the responsibility of everyone, but vet-
erinarians who understand sound ecologic principles can impart a
potent inﬂuence in their sphere of involvement. Discussion of the
concepts of the indicator species and the biology of extinction provides
examples of challenging ﬁelds for research and ampliﬁes the impor-
tance of ecology today.

(I ll) Hazards of Environmental Pollution with DDT and
Other Organochlorines to Animal Populations
Larry Z. McFarland, D.V.M.. Ph.D.. and Ronald L. Garrett. B.A.
Davis, California

For more than 2 decades billions of pounds of DDT and other
organochlorines have been added to the environment. Subsequently
these persistent pesticides have been redistributed by wind, water,
and animals from the point of application throughout the earth’s

l4l

 

 

 




 

ecosystem. Most living organisms contain organochlorine residues;
the highest concentrations are in the carnivorous species. The actual
concentration of organochlorines in animals of the food chain is
determined by the complex interaction between animal and environ-
ment, since different animals absorb, store, detoxify, and excrete
pesticides at differing rates.

The organochlorines have been used predominantly to beneﬁt public
health, especially in malaria control. It is ironic that by saving
millions of human lives man has disrupted the Earth’s ecosystem
and possibly has endangered his future existence. The hazards of
organochlorine pesticides on animal populations to date are death,
reproductive impairment, disruption of natural species balance, de-
cline of some species, and altered behavior. Man must consider
carefully and nonemotionally the intimate balance between what is
good for man (public health) and what is good for man’s environ-
ment (world ecology).

(I I3) Phenol Toxicity and Metabolism—Comparative
Aspects

Frederick W. Oehme. D.V.M.l Ph.D.. and Lloyd E. Davis' D.V.M.. Ph.D.

Manhattan, Kansas, and Columbus, Ohio

The toxicity and metabolism of phenol was studied in dogs, cats,
pigs, and goats following intravenous injections of 1‘tC-phenol. No-
eﬁect, toxic, and nearly lethal dosages were used. Similar toxic effects
were exhibited at each of the dose levels in dogs, pigs, and goats, but
less than one-half the dose was required to produce similar effects
in cats. Toxicity was manifest as muscular tremors and “paddling”
convulsions. Metabolism of the injected phenol was most rapid in
goats, intermediate in pigs and dogs, and slowest in cats. Fifty-seven
to 92% of the injected phenol was accounted for in urine after 48
hours, but recovery percentage varied with the dose and species.
Urine from injected animals contained free phenol and the sulfate
and glucuronide conjugation products. Dogs excreted all three me-
tabolites in their urine, cats excreted only the conjugation products,
pigs excreted predominantly phenylglucuronide, and goats excreted
primarily phenylsulfate. At the higher dose levels the proportion
of phenylglucuronide in urine increased markedly in all species
except cats.

indicated an intense stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous
system.

Chronic studies in swine showed that oral doses of carbaryl ranging
from 31.5 to 300.0 mg./kg. induce altered gait, ataxia, posterior
paresis, prostration, and death after 18 to 7 weeks, respectively.

Administration of carbaryl to dogs and sheep at levels of 625 and
600 mg./kg., respectively, for 4 months did not elicit signs of toxicity
other than anorexia, diarrhea in sheep, and extreme emaciation in
the dogs.

Reproductive studies in swine, sheep, and hamsters did not show
any deleterious action of carbaryl at doses employed. However, small
(6.25 to 50.0 mg./kg.) doses of carbaryl fed to pregnant Beagles
resulted in dystocias, an apparent contraceptive effect at the highest
dose level, and a teratogenic action at all but the lowest and the
highest levels.

In recent years, attention has been focused on the potential health
hazards associated with the exposure of man to a variety of environ-
mental pollutants. Numerous toxicity studies have been conducted
in laboratory animals to assess the consequences of such exposures
and to provide information for extrapolation to man. This report
will describe studies under way in our laboratory since 1965, designed
to evaluate the biological consequences of a single inhalation ex-
posure to radioactive aerosols in a long-lived, medium-sized subject,
the Beagle dog. The report will emphasize the rationale of the studies
including: (a) development and use of a breeding program designed
to provide dogs of similar genotype over several decades for intro-
duction into a series of sequential, interrelated experiments, (b) use
of a randomized block experimental design with provision for studying
the effects of graded initially deposited levels of radioactivity over
the lifespan of the dog, and (c) selection of radiation dose patterns
to evaluate the inﬂuence of (1) tissues irradiated, (2) degree of homo-
geneity of irradiation of tissue, (3) relative effectiveness of alpha, beta,
and gamma irradiation, (4) radiation dose rate, and (5) total radi-
ation dose. Preliminary results will be cited to illustrate the approach
being used. This long-term research effort, which involves the use of
several thousand dogs, provides a prototype for the design and con-
duct of research on other potential environmental pollutants.

(I I6) Toxicity of Beryllium and Other Trace Elements
in Missile Propellants

F. R. Robinsonl D.V.M.. Ph.D.
Washington, DC.

Beryllium is an expensive metal that is used in spite of its cost
and toxicity of some of its compounds. Until recent years the indus-
trial exposures represented the topic of most importance. However,
recently the focus of the beryllium problem is shifting away from the
purely industrial exposures to concern for environmental contamina-
tion as the result of new uses of the metal.

There are over 700 cases of beryllium disease in the Beryllium
Case Registry. Many of these cases arose as a result of the use of
beryllium phosphors in the ﬂuorescent lamp industry in the 1940’s.
The incidence of cases has declined since 1950 and is probably due to
the improved industrial hygiene practices that were instituted to con-
trol the problem arising in the beryllium phosphor—related disease-
Even so, there appear to be enough acute and chronic cases of recent
onset to establish the disease as being of more than purely historical
interest.

Trace elements and other elements in trace amounts are present
in the exhaust products of rocket motors. However, there is little
concern for these elements since they are in very small amounts and
not known to cause disease in the human or animal populations.

(I I8) The Role of the Veterinarian in Air Pollution
Research

Ronald E. Engel. D.V.M.I Ph.D.: Jerry F. Stara. D.V.M.. M.P.H.

Durham, North Carolina, and Cincinnati, Ohio

The clean air act, as amended, gives emphasis to the control of
air pollution on a regional basis throughout the United States. To
fulﬁll the requirements of the act, extensive research in air pollution
has been undertaken by the US. government. Unless professionals
are trained in environmental research, our national goal for clean
air can not be achieved within a reasonable time.

Research in air pollution is intensifying every day. The alloca-
tions of resources for such research have been committed, therefore
it is incumbent on the veterinary profession to meet the demands for
the “environmental veterinarian.”

The role of the veterinarian in air pollution is an ever increasing
one. Colleges of Veterinary Medicine must prepare their graduates
for their new roles as members on the environmental research team
with engineers, physicians, chemists, and physicists.

This report describes the areas of research in air pollution available
to veterinarians. The qualiﬁcations necessary for the performance
of the various tasks are also described.

(I I9) Utilization of the Microti’rer System for Detecting
Agglutinins Against Bordeiella bronchisep’rica.

Ames, Iowa

The agglutinins of Bordetella bronchiseptica were titrated in a
microtiter system utilizing the settling patterns of the antigen dis-
cernible at 14 X magniﬁcation. The titers of swine serum samples
detectable by this particulate antigen settling test were consistently
30 to 50 times higher than results from the plate, tube, and micro-
agglutination methods. The particulate antigen settling test was
useful for the detection of antibody to B. bronchiseptica and B. per-
tusszs in both infected and resistant swine. By contrast, serum
agglutinins prepared in rabbits to Salmonella spp. antigens were
titrated by the various agglutination tests, and the response among
tests on an individual serum sample were approximately the same.

“20) lmmune Response of Swine to African Swine
Fever Infection

W. P. Heuschele. D.V.M.. PhD.
Greenport, New York

In the ﬁeld, African swine fever (ASF) virus is maintained in wild
pigs which are subclinical virus carriers. In domestic swine, ASF virus
produces a highly infectious, generally fatal disease. Occasional sur-
vival can not be attributed with certainty to protective antibody. Two
groups of 15 and 4 swine were inoculated with the 89th and 83rd
swine bone marrow culture passage virus, respectively. The 83rd
passage Virus was attenuated to a much greater degree than the
89th passage, based on clinicopathologic manifestations. The group
of 15 swine became carriers and experienced recurrent fever. All the
swine in this group had absolute hypergammaglobulinernia with high
complement-ﬁxing (CF) and precipitating antibody titers detectable
21 days postinoculation (DPI) and thereafter. The electrophoretic
patterns of increased gamma globulin were mostly polyclonal; how-
ever, monoclonal and diclonal patterns were also seen in several
serum samples collected in an early phase of the disease. Virus was
recovered from most of the swine.

The 4-swine group, given well-attenuated virus, had fever for 1
to 2 days within 7 DPI and had no recurrence. They resisted challenge
inoculation with virulent virus. The gamma globulin levels of all
swine in this group remained within normal limits. However, these
swine had low CF and precipitating antibody titers but were appar-
ently free from virus. Hypergammaglobulinemia may reﬂect con-
tinuous antigenic stimulation by persistent viral infection.

(l2l) Comparison of Plasmodium berghei and
Trypanosoma lewisi Infection in the Neonatally
Thymectomized Albino Rat

William L. Hanson. Ph.D.. and Willie L. Chapman. Jr.. D.V.M.. PhD.
Athens, Georgia

Neonatally thymectomized CDF albino rats (Charles River) were
infected with the pathogenic intraerythrocytic protozoan parasite,
Plasmodium berghei, or the nonpathogenic extracellular protozoan,
Trypanosoma lewisi. One hundred-thirty rats were utilized in these
experiments. Neonatally thymectomized, sham-operated, and un-
operated control rats were challenged with 0.5 X 10“, 1.0 X 106, or
5.0 X 10" P. berghei infected erythrocytes at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of age,
and parasitemia, anemia, and mortality were studied. Others were
infected with 1.0 X 106 or 5.0 X 106 T. lewisi at 8 or 12 weeks of age
and parasitemia was investigated. The rat, in general, becomes less
susceptible to P. berghei or T. lewisi with increasing age. At each
age studied with P. berghei infections and with each parasite dosage,
neonatally thymectomized animals developed signiﬁcantly higher par-
asitemias, more severe anemias, and in younger rats, higher mor-
talities, than sham-operated or unoperated controls. Signiﬁcant
differences were not observed in parasitemias in neonatally thymec-
tomized, sham-operated, or unoperated control rats challenged with
T. lewisi. These observations suggested that in the rat, thymus-
dependent cell-mediated immunity may play a role in acquired
immunity to the intracellular protozoan parasite P. berghei, but
probably does not have a role in acquired immunity to the extra—
cellular blood protozoan parasite, T. lewisi.

(l22) Canine Hookworm Vaccine
Thomas A. Miller. Ph.D.. B.V.M.S.

Kansas City, Missouri

A vaccine has been developed which consists of a suspension of
live infective larvae of the canine hookworm, Ancylostoma caninum,
that have been attenuated by exposure to ionizing radiation. Vaccine
should be inoculated by the subcutaneous route. Two doses of vaccine,
at an interval of not less than 14 days, is required for best results.
The vaccination schedule may be started in dogs of any age, although
3 weeks is the earliest practical recommendation.

Within 7 to 14 days after the vaccination schedule is completed,
vaccinated pups 'can withstand challenge infections that are lethal to
unvaccinated controls. Vaccinated pups are endowed with a resistance
to the establishment of 90% or more of the worms of the challenge
and are completely protected against hookworm disease. Protection
against infection and the immunity to disease are fully effective ir-
respective of the method of challenge infection whether this be by
experimental subcutaneous inoculation or oral administration of infec-
tive larvae, or by natural exposure under ﬁeld conditions to a heavily
contaminated environment.

Although monovalent in its composition (only A. caninum) the
vaccine confers a polyvalent protection against infection with all three
canine hookworms, and when used in cats protects against challenge
infection with their speciﬁc hookworm.

SYMPOSIUM—ANTIBODY FORMATION

(l23b) Cellular Aspects of Antibody Formation

M. J. Freeman, D.V.M.. Ph.D.: Helen Braley: W. P. McArthur
Lafayette, Indiana, and New York, New York

Modern concepts of antibody synthesis have been developed
largely from studies performed with an isolated spleen cell culture

 

system and by transfer of cells to irradiated, repopulated, syngeneic
recipients.

Most recent information on the cellular events of antibody syn-
thesis has been obtained in systems using the erythrocyte as the
antigen and the hemolysis-in-gel assay which permits enumeration
of cells producing antierythrocyte antibody.

Recent results have emphasized the complexity of the cellular
mechanisms of antibody synthesis. For some antigens, initial uptake
and processing by a macrophage appears to be essential. Previously
it was thought that the macrophage supplied the nucleic acid which
dlrected other cells to synthesize antibody. Howver, the role of the
nucleicacid may only be to serve as an adjuvant or carrier for an
active, Immunogenic fragment of antigen.

Other studies have indicated that separate cells derived from the
thymus and bone marrow are required for antibody synthesis. The
number and mechanisms of these cooperative cellular interactions
are not yet clear, but a minimum of three separate cells, described
so far only on an operational basis, may be involved. The ﬁnal

elucidation of antibody synthesis will require further major technical
and conceptual advances.

(I23c) Induction of Antibody Formation and
Immunologic Paralysis

Diego Segre. D.V.M.

Urbana, Illinois

Young offspring of immunologically paralyzed mice were more
susceptible to the induction of both paralysis and immunity to
pneumococcic polysaccharide type III (SIII) than were normal mice
of the same age. This difference gradually decreased with age. The
difference in immunologic responsiveness between the two types of
mice was attributed to a lesser concentration of natural antibody
Speciﬁc for 8111 in offspring of paralyzed mice, which did not acquire
this speciﬁc antibody from their mothers, as compared with normal
mice of the same age. Administration of either speciﬁcally puriﬁed
anti-SIII or normal IgG restored the offspring of paralyzed mice
to the same level of susceptibility to the induction of both paralysis
and immunity as that exhibited by normal mice. The biologic activity
of normal IgG was removed by a speciﬁc immunoabsorbent, and re-
covered by elution, thereby conﬁrming that the effect of normal IgG
was also due to speciﬁc anti—SIII antibody. It was, therefore, con-

I47

 

 

 




 

cluded that a relative deﬁciency of natural anti-SIII antibody was
indeed responsible for the altered immunologic behavior of offspring
of paralyzed mice, and that the results obtained are compatible with,
and explained by, a role of preformed antibody in the induction of
antibody formation and of immunologic paralysis.

(l23d) Regulation of Antibody Synthesis
Merlin L. Kaeberle, D.V.M., PhD.

Ames, Iowa

Antibody synthesis, like other body processes, is controlled by
regulatory mechanisms. The character of the immune response with
an orderly process of immunoglobulin synthesis and only occasional
dyscrasias is indicative of this control.

Control mechanisms must operate to (1) insure a degree of
speciﬁcity of the antibodies formed against an antigen, (2) prevent
formation of antibodies directed against “self” components, (3) limit
cell recruitment for any one antigenic stimulation, (4) limit prolifera—
tion of antibody-producing cells with consequential restriction on
quantity of antibody synthesized, and (5) insure a pool of available
noncommitted cells.

The regulatory mechanisms operate to control the speciﬁcity and
extent of the antibody response. Speciﬁcity is controlled by those
mechanisms which select cells for production of antibody to a par-
ticular antigenic determinant. The extent of the response depends
on factors which affect (1) the ability of an antigen to induce antibody
synthesis, (2) the number of antigen-sensitive cells recruited, (3)
the proliferation of antigen-sensitive and antibody-producing cells, and
(4) the antibody output of individual antibody-producing cells. Con—
trol is mediated by a complex interaction of genetic, anatomic,
physiologic, and immunologic mechanisms.

The role of anatomic and physiologic factors is still somewhat
speculative. The distribution of antigen-sensitive cells in various
tissues may determine accessibility to antigenic stimulation. The
association of antigen-sensitive cells and macrophages during a critical
period would regulate recruitment of antigen-sensitive cells. The
extent of the response may be limited by space restrictions on the
cloning process in lymphoid tissues.

Immunologic factors that function in the regulatory process in-
clude both antigen and antibody. The nature and dose of antigen can
determine whether tolerance or antibody synthesis results to a par-
ticular antigenic determinant. Tolerance can restrict the speciﬁcity
range of the antibody response. The dose of antigen may inﬂuence
the extent of the response through numbers of antigen-sensitive cells
recruited or stimulation of the progeny of antigen-sensitive cells.

Speciﬁc antibody possesses a regulatory role and may either en-
hance or inhibit a primary response. Enhancement of the response
can be explained on the basis of complexing of the antibody with
antigen to inﬂuence its distribution. Inhibition has been explained
on the basis of the formation of antigen-antibody complexes and
also on the basis of direct action of antibody on cells. Feedback
inhibition to restrict further differentiation of antigen-sensitive cells
or further proliferation of recently committed cells would serve to
limit the immune response.

(l23e) The Immunoglobulins
John W. Osebold. D.V.M.. PhD.

Davis, California

In recent years a great deal of information has become available
concerning the structure and function of proteins with antibody
activity, the immunoglobulins. The 3 main classes of immunoglobulins
are called IgG, IgA, and IgM. Proteins of these classes are found
in man and probably occur in all species of mammals. The principal
techniques for separating serum proteins will be mentioned in relation
to their role in the elucidation of the immunoglobulins.

The molecule of IgG has been shown to consist of 4 polypeptide
chains. Portions of these polypeptide chains are known to contribute
biological functions to the molecule such as the combining sites,

 

ﬁxation of complement, transfer across the placenta, ﬁxation to skin
cells, and allotype speciﬁcity (a heritable antigen).

The term “secretory immunoglobulin” is applied to IgA because
of its high concentration in colostrum, saliva, respiratory secretions,
and intestinal secretions. A remarkable mechanism for transporting
this antibody across epithelial barriers will be described. There is
reason to believe that the local synthesis of IgA may have great
Importance in host resistance.

Signiﬁcant variations in the classes of immunoglobulins will be
presented, such as the two classes of IgG found in sheep and cattle.

noglobulins provides direct evidence about genetic control of immuno-

globulin structure. Comparisons of sequences of puriﬁed immunoglob-

ulins has shown that portions of both the light (L) and heavy (H)

chains are controlled by genes that are inherited like other proteins
such as hemoglobin. These genes control the sequences of the COOH-
terminal half or constant (C) region of the various classes of L and
H chains (lambda, kappa, alpha, gamma, mu, and so on).

Of greatest interest for the study of antibody speciﬁcity is the re-
markable variability found in the NHz-terminal half or variable (V)
region. The genes for this region are not inherited in Mendelian
fashion. A large number of genes is required to code for the many
sequences in the V region, and in contrast only a few genes for the
C region. Thus two genes somehow code for one polypeptide chain.
The molecular basis for the generation of this diversity will be re-
viewed. The conclusions provide considerable stimulus in the study
of differentiation.

Research—Third Session

(l24) Veterinarians and Marine Research
Sam H. Ridgway. D.V.M.

San Diego, California

Marine mammals and other aquatic life are being used as exhibits
in zoos, aquariums, amusement parks, and oceanariums. They are
also kept by research laboratories and universities as models for bio-
medical, behavioral, and bionic research. Veterinarians working with
this group of animals have formed an organization known as the
International Association for Aquatic Animal Medicine. The mem-
bership of this organization are concerned with the following: ( 1)
maintenance of healthy aquatic animals for display and laboratory
research purposes, (2) environmental pollution and its effect on aqua-
tic life both in the wild and in captivity as well as in biological means
of pollution control, (3) ecologic stability and conservation of marine
life, and (4) extension of world food resources to feed an expanding
world population.

In order to maintain animals for primary areas of research, stud-
ies are usually required on disease control, husbandry and main-
tenance, ecology, and reproduction, among others. The increased use
of aquatic animals in the laboratory will provide vital knowledge
and capabilities in (1) medical research and student training, (2)
diseases of ﬁsh and other aquatic animals used as food, (3) ecology
and conservation, (4) pollution eﬁects and biological control of pollu-
tion, (5) nutrition and new food species development, (6) development
of new drugs from the sea, (7) controlling dangerous marine animals
such as sharks, rays, and poisonous ﬁshes, (8) bionic research in div—
ing, hydrodynamics, underwater acoustics, circulation, biocybernetics,
and neural control mechanisms, (9) behavioral research, and (10)
public education and recreation.

(I25) The Veterinarian's New Role in Sea Farming

Samuel R. Monroe. Jr.. D.V.M.
Pensacola, Florida

Man’s conquest of the ocean will prove to be his third great
achievement of this century and will be equally as important as his
ﬁrst two great achievements of the 20th century—the atomic age
and the space age. The veterinarian’s role in the newly developing
ﬁeld of ocean space is discussed.

In man’s conquest of the ocean, mariculture, which is marine
agriculture (farming of the sea), will play a vital and exciting role.
The part that the veterinarian will play, in farming the sea to
produce food for man, is outlined, especially as regards diseases of
ﬁsh and other marine life, pollution, selected breeding, ﬁsheries man-
agement, nutrition, and economics.

There are many different kinds of problems in the ocean; there-
fore many different kinds of specialists will be needed in man’s
conquest of the ocean frontier. Special emphasis is given to the

ISO

“team” approach to solving problems in a controlled marine en-
vironment, and the need for the veterinarian to cooperate with other
groups such as marine biologists, biochemists, plankton experts, and
oceanographers is stressed. Colored slides showing the author’s sea
tarming activities will be shown.

SYMPOSIUM—NEUROLOGIC DISEASES IN SMALL ANIMALS

(l29b) Correlated Aspects of Neurologic and
Behavioral Development in the Dog

M. W. Fox. Ph.D.. B.Vet.Mecl.

St. Louis, Missouri

 

The development of various reﬂexes in the dog is described
against a background of histologic and electrophysiologic studies of
brain and spinal cord development. Reﬂex development can be corre-
lated with structuro-functional changes in the nervous system to form
a basis for developmental neurologic diagnosis.

Certain reﬂexes and more complex neonatal responses do not
“mature out” but persist, being incorporated into more complex and
often motivationally different behaviors later in life. The signiﬁcance
of this phenomenon of ontogenetic emancipation and ritualization
is discussed in relation to emotional reactivity, socialization, and

communication.

(l29c) Spinal Cord Origin of the Components
of the Mic’ruri’rion Reflex

J. E. Oliver. Jr.. D.V.M.. Ph.D.: W. E. Bradley. M.D.;
T. F. Fletcher. D.V.M.. PhD.

Athens, Georgia; Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota

The site of origin from the spinal cord and peripheral pathways
of the sensory and motor nerves to the urinary bladder and external
urethral sphincter were delineated by the methods of evoked response
in 30 cats and retrograde degeneration in 12 cats.

The parasympathetic preganglionic neurons originated in the
sacral segments in the intermediate regions of the gray matter and
reached the bladder by way of the pelvic nerve. The preganglionic
parasympathetic perikaryons to the urinary bladder were distributed
over a length of approximately 1.5 segments, centered near the junc-
tion of segments 8-2 and 8-3.

The sympathetic innervation of the urinary bladder involved two
pathways, a small component directly from the sacral sympathetic
trunk ganglia and the major pathway in the hypogastric nerve. Ipsi-
lateral and contralateral preganglionic and afferent sympathetic ﬁbers
originated in the L-2—5 segments and traveled through the caudal
mesenteric plexus and hypogastric nerve to the urinary bladder. They
usually were distributed over approximately two full segments cen-
tered near the junction of L—3 and L-4.

The urethral branch of the pudendal nerve supplied the somatic
innervation of the external urethral sphincter. The motor neurons
to the urethra were located in the ventral part of the ventral horn
of the sacral spinal cord, extending for approximately two segments
with a center near the junction of segments 8-1 and 8—2.

(l29f) Canine Epilepsy
James G. CunninghamI D.V.M.

Davis, California

Canine epilepsy, like human and other epilepsies, is an excessive
paroxysmal neuronal discharge. When clinically manifested, it may
produce a great diversity of signs including abnormal motor activity,
disturbances of consciousness, autonomic signs, and behavioral changes.
Such abnormal neuronal activity may arise in only part of the brain
producing focal, asymmetrical signs (partial epilepsy) or in a more
generalized way throughout the whole brain (or at least both
cortices) leading to symmetrical signs.

Anything that alters neuronal function in the brain is potentially
epileptogenic. Extracranial processes leading to abnormal brain
function such as hypoglycemia and hypoxia are known to be epi-
leptogenic. Such intracranial processes as neoplasms, encephalitis,
hydrocephalus, and contusion and hemorrhage of traumatic origin
have also been shown to lead to canine epilepsy. Cerebral pathology
cannot be found in another large number of epileptic dogs. This
“idiopathic” epilepsy may have an hereditary origin.

A routine approach to the canine epileptic will be discussed,
including the laboratory tests for extracranial causes, neurologic exam—

ination, skull radiography, and cerebrospinal ﬂuid tap and pressure
studies as aids in the diagnosis of intracranial causes. More special-
ized tests such as electroencephalography and cerebral angiography
will also be described.

The medical management of the canine epileptic will then be dis-
cussed.

Research—Fifth Session

U30) Biostatistics and the Design of Experiments in
Veterinary Research

Robert R. Jorgensen. D.V.M.. M.P.H.

M onterey, California

Veterinarians, particularly those engaged in biomedical research,
will ﬁnd the 1970’s bringing an increasing proportion of our profes-
sional membership into direct involvement with scientiﬁc inquiries
commonly called experiments. These experiments, which must be
properly planned if they are to be meaningful, frequently generate
numerical values called data which must be interpreted in a sophis-
ticated fashion.

.This report concerns itself with the proposition that modern vet-
ermary research will rely increasingly on biostatistics as a necessary
and valuable professional ally, and that it will beneﬁt us to learn the
essential words of the language of the biostatistician and the elements
of the design of experiments. The result will be a marked increase in
our ability to interpret the results of our data and the reduction in the
need for the biostatistician to “diagnose” for a “sick,” that is, poorly
des1gned, experiment.

Basic principles of the design or planning of experiments, an
example of a poorly designed experiment, and opportunities for
self-education in biostatistics as it relates to veterinary medicine
W111 be outlined. The distinction between a working knowledge of
biostatlstics and a mathematical background will be emphasized.

U32) Metastasis: New Method of Cell Labeling tor
Quantitative Analysis of Tumor Spread

Isaiah J. Ficller. D.V.M.. Ph.D.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Quantitative, relatively unequivocal results can be obtained by
applying the labeling technique of tumor cells with 1251 5-iodo-2’-
deoxyuridine to studies of tumor cell embolism, arrest, and metastasis.
. C57 mice were injected IV with labeled cells and were killed at
Intervals of 1 minute to 2 Weeks later. Blood, urine, and organs were
collected, processed, and monitored.

l53

 

 




 

The data permitted the following conclusions. Although the lungs
trap the majority of tumor cell emboli, a fair number of emboli
recirculate. Tumor cell death occurs rapidly, and about 1% of the
cells survive after 24 hours. About 400 melanoma cells were in the
lungs after 14 days and these yielded an average of 80 metastases.
Apparently each metastasis originates from very few surviving tumor
cells.

(I33) Immunoproliterative Disorders with Monoclonal
Gammopathies in the Dog

Arthur I. Hurvitz. D.V.M.. Ph.D.. and Ray Prata. D.V.M.
New York, New York

A broad group of plasma cell or plasma cell-like proliferative
disorders exist which are allied to the classic syndrome of multiple
myeloma as described in the dog. Analysis of the serum electropho-
retic patterns in these irnmunoproliferative disorders reveals lowered
albumin and elevated globulin. The abnormal globulin (paraprotein)
is homogeneous as compared to diffuse patterns found in other diseases
producing hypergammaglobulinemia. In man, paraproteins are clas-
siﬁed on the basis of their chemical, physical, and immunologic
properties, and an attempt has been made to correlate the clinical
and pathologic manifestations with the class of paraprotein being
elaborated. Except for one case where the paraprotein was classiﬁed
as 7 A, [Meadway, W. et al. J .A.V.M.A., 150, (1967): 386], detailed
classiﬁcations of the paraprotein in related canine disorders have not
been done.

We have studied three cases of canine gammopathies. The para-
protein in each case belongs to a different immunoglobulin class,
i.e., 'y M, 'y A, and Bence-Jones protein. These cases presented dis-
tinct clinical pathologic features which were similar to those found
in man with comparable disorders.

Understanding of the chemical structure of human immunoglob-
ulins has come from the study of human myeloma proteins and Wal-
denstrom’s macroglobulins. The paraprotein usually represents the
product of a single clone of cells that have undergone neoplastic
changes. The proteins are obtainable in large quantities in a puri-
ﬁed state and are homogeneous relative to normal immunoglobulins
or most puriﬁed antibody preparations. Studies of the paraprotein in
similar conditions in dogs should contribute greatly to our under-
standing of canine immunoglobulins.

(I34) Quantitative Bone Marrow Evaluation Procedures
Using Serial Sampling

Bethesda, Maryland, and Davis, California

The biopsy or aspiration of bone marrow is becoming a mroe rou-
tine procedure for the diagnostic evaluation of hematopoietic disorders
encountered in clinical veterinary medicine. Common accessible sites
for aspiration include the iliac crest in dogs and the proximal femur
and iliac crest in cats. Multiple, repeated marrow aspirations are

occasionally required to establish a diagnosis of a hematopoietic
dyscrasia, e.g., leukemia, myeloproliferative disorders, or to follow
the progressive changes occurring quantitatively or morphologically
in the erythroid, myeloid, or megakaryocytic cell lines in other con-
ditions. The ribs, particularly in the dog, offer distinct advantages
over other anatomic sites for obtaining multiple aspirations from
previously undisturbed active bone marrow. A procedure adaptable
for use in both diagnostic clinical veterinary medicine as well as
research will be described for obtaining repeated rib marrow samples
under local anesthesia from the standing restrained dog, along with
normal marrow cell differential values and values from marrow from
other sites for purposes of comparison. Visual aids will be used to
illustrate key points of this report.

U35) Bluetongue Virus: Some Relationships Among
North American Isolates and Comparisons with
the Virus ot Epizootic Hemorrhagic

Disease of Deer

Frederick C. Thomas. D.V.M.. and Daniel 0. Trainer. Ph.D.

Madison, Wisconsin

Several isolates of bluetongue virus (BTV) and one of the viruses
of epizootic hemorrhagic disease of deer (EHD) were obtained and
plaque puriﬁed in L-929 cells. These were then compared anti-
gemcally and on the basis of plaque size and morphology. Antiserums
were prepared against BTV in calves, and pools of 3 calves for each
Isolate were used as the reference serums. The EHD antiserum was
similarly prepared in deer. A sensitive plaque-reduction neutraliza-
tion test was developed to make antigenic comparisons and proved
to be a useful quantitative method. Two-way neutralization titers
were examined to deﬁne the degree of antigenic relatedness among
the BTV isolates and between these and the virus of EHD.

Columbia, Missouri, and St. Paul, Minnesota

_Serologic tests and viral isolation procedures were performed on
26 111 calves involved in an epizootic of respiratory-enteric disease in
beef cattle. Of the total population of 188 cattle, morbidity exceeded
95 %, and 4 calves died. Infection began in a group of steers that had
been received 4 days earlier and then spread sequentially to 2 other
g {cups of cattle in the immediate area. The epizootic curve had a
trlmogal distribution, with treated cases occurring within a 3-week

isolated from 5 calves, and 5 calves had a fourfold or greater increase
in titer to BVD virus. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (1BR) virus was
not isolated, but 3 calves became serotest-positive and 1 calf developed
a fourfold increase in titer against that virus. An unidentiﬁed cyto-
pathogenic agent was isolated from the calf which had a fourfold
increase in titer to IBR virus. Three calves had evidence of dual infec-
tion with BVD and PI—3 viruses.

(I37) Immunotluorescence with Mycoplasma hyorhinis
and a Sterol-Requiring Strain of Mycoplasma granularum

Leon N. D. Potgieter. B.V.$c.. and Richard F. Ross. D.V.M.I Ph.D.

Ames, Iowa

Fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugates were prepared with serums
of various animals hyperimmunized with M ycoplasma hyorhinis
(strain SK76) and Mycoplasma granularum (strain 816).

Nonspeciﬁc ﬂuorescence of both swine and rabbit globulin conju-
gates was most effectively removed by diethylaminoethylcellulose
chromatography with a 0.1 M pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. Antibodies
to medium components were removed by conjugate absorption with
M ycoplasma laidlawii grown in a suitable medium. Autoﬂuorescence
of nonsterol-requiring mycoplasmas was eliminated with a chelated
azo . dye counterstain. The conjugates were species speciﬁc when
tested with a variety of mycoplasmas.

Examination of sections of visceral organs from pigs experimentally
infected with M. hyorhinis revealed cocci and larger spherical bodies
in the serosal exudate. Fluorescent coccoid forms were observed in
the superﬁcial cell layers of synovial membranes from arthritic joints
of these animals.

Synovial membranes and some lymph nodes from pigs experi-
mentally infected with M ycoplasma granularum exhibited a ﬂuores-
cent ﬁlamentous network. Fluorescence was mainly in the subsyno-
Vial area of the synovial membrane, but small coccal aggregates and
ﬁlaments were noticed irregularly between and on the superﬁcial
cell layers.

(I38) Coronary Circulation in Swine: An Experimental
Model for Myocardial Infarction Research

Robert R. Pensinger. M.S.. D.V.M.
La Jolla, California

An experimental model is essential in the understanding of a
disease process. The pig has many advantages in studies of the
coronary circulation and the development of cardiac arrhythmias and
myocardial infarction after experimental coronary occlusion. How-
ever, convenience and habit perpetuate the continued use of the dog
in many medical research laboratories. The observations reported in
this paper are based on original ﬁndings as a veterinary research

investigator in coronary circulation studies. Practical and scientiﬁc
observations should establish the pig as an experimental model for
the following reasons: (1) There is increasing difﬁculty in the pro-
curement of large, healthy dogs for this type of research and, with
an imbalance of supply and demand, the price of dogs exceeds the
cost of pigs. A program can be organized to supply pigs by contract
without humane objections. (2) The many variables of dogs can be
known factors in swine: age, breeding, size, health history, environ-
ment, shipping. (3) Technicians and medical investigators often
realize that the pig is actually easier to use for acute or some chronic
studies. (4) The coronary circulation anatomy is strikingly similar
to that of the human heart. Also, the consistent anatomic pattern
of the pig provides a better-controlled experiment. (5) After
experimental coronary occlusion in the pig, the electrical derange-
ments are consistent and comparable to serious arrhythmias occurring
in the human heart after sudden coronary circulation disturbances.
(6) Chronic myocardial infarction studies show that the pig does not
have an existing collateral circulation. This compares with the human
heart before coronary atherosclerosis and ischemia stimulate col-
lateral circulation. It is thought that sudden death in younger men
is due to the sudden coronary occlusion before the development
of collateral circulation. In addition to this observation, other workers
have shown that spontaneous diseases, such as athersclerosis of the
major coronary artery, can be produced in the pig. Thus, we have
presented our reasons for utilizing the pig in coronary artery re-
search. We have also presented some of our observations. With the
increasing responsibility of the veterinarian in laboratory animal
medicine and research programs, it is helpful to understand these
ﬁndings as an integral part of the research team.

(I39) Artificial Heart: Effects of Endogenous Heat
in Miniature Swine

Manuel T. Karagianes. D.V.M.. and Murlin F. CivvillisI D.V.M.
Richland, Washington

Total artiﬁcial heart implantation requires deﬁnition of the tol-

erance of the host to added endogenous heat generated by the power
source/ energy converter of the artiﬁcial heart. Sponsored by the
Artiﬁcial Heart Program of the National Heart Institute, investi-
gators at Battelle-Northwest are now in the fourth year of study
t0 determine limitations in crucial areas, such as the host’s ability to
adJIISt physiologically to increased heat loads without harm to criti-
cal organs or impairment of normal functions. To accomplish the
study, electrical heat exchangers were designed to deliver 0 to 140 w.
power and were implanted in the descending thoracic aorta of Hanford
miniature swine. Experiments have included acute, subacute, and
chronic studies, with swine continuing on heat for periods beyond
twenty months to date. Whereas results presently indicate that mini-
swine tolerate added endogenous heat for periods in excess of one
year, a decreased tolerance in the presence of high ambient tem-
perature or pyrexia suggests practical problems which may be en-
countered in the human recipient.

Earlier investigators and this project at Letterman Army Insti-
tute of Research have utilized unanesthetized sheep restrained in a
standing position. Twenty-four hours prior to an experiment, arte-
rial and venous catheters are inserted under general anesthesia.
Parameters monitored continuously are cortical electroencephalo-
gram, electrocardiogram, aortic and central venous pressures, res-
piration, and rectal temperature. Arterial and venous pH and blood
gases are measured hourly. Arterial blood values are determined
hourly for protein, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, creatinine, lactate,
catecholamines and electrolytes. Blood volume is determined prior
to hemorrhage. Urine outputs are monitored with an indwelling
catheter. A modiﬁed Lamson technique is used to produce shock
refractory to transfusion. Treatment is administered with the shed
blood at the end of the hypovolemic period. Surviving sheep are
observed for 72 hours or until death. Of 8 control animals given
no treatment except reinfusion of shed blood, none survived longer
than 36 hours. The drugs studied all improved survival ratios; amino-
pentylphorothioate was the most effective, with all animals surviving
of a group of 5. Signiﬁcant differences between this preparation and
those utilizing anesthetized dogs were also noticed and will be dis-
cussed.

(I43) Collection and Utilization of Cat Semen for
Artificial Insemination

Nickolas J. Soika. M.S.. D.V.M.. and Lee L. Jennings. B.S.
Charlottesville, Virginia

Semen is collected from toms with an artiﬁcial vagina using an
estrus queen as a teaser. Approximately 3 out of 5 toms are train-
able and generally respond predictably in 7 to 10 days. The average
ejaculate volume is 0.04 ml. containing 57 X 10“ sperm. Toms can
be ejaculated 2 or 3 times per week without signiﬁcantly lowering
their sperm count. Daily collection gives semen volume and sperm
count reﬂecting uniform daily spermatogenic potential after the 4th
day. Semen is diluted with saline, citrate buffer and egg yolk, and
phosphate buffer and egg yolk. The latter 2 are combined at 1: 1

ratio with egg yolk. Estrus queens detected by physical behavior
and cytology are inseminated with 0.1 ml. diluted semen deposited
into the anterior vagina or posterior cervix. Pregnancy will result
from deposition of 1.25 X 10“ sperm, but not less than 5 X 10“ sperm
are recommended for routine insemination. The queen is induced
to ovulate with 50 I.U. of chorionic gonadotropin injected intra-
muscularly. Citrate and phosphate buffered semen, or both, will
maintain excellent viability for as long as 7 days when stored at 4 C.
One insemination will cause conception in 50% of the queens. If
inseminated a second time in 24 hours and given an additional 10
I.U. of human chorionic gonadotropin better conception rates (75%)
are obtained.

with these vaccines was evaluated and compared to that of natural
infection with virulent virus. The interference of maternally derived
immunity with these vaccines was also evaluated.

From the results of this and other studies, recommendations for
immunization of cats against FPL are discussed.

Feline Pneumonitis Vaccine
R. M. Cello. D.V.M.. and Carmen Mauris, B.S.

Davis, California

A study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of a commer-
cially available vaccine in protecting susceptible cats from infection
with feline pneumonitis agent. Infection was judged on the basis of
clinical signs, the presence of inclusion bodies in conjunctival epithelial
cells, and recovery of the organism from the conjunctiva or nasal
mucosa, or both.

Cats vaccinated with this product were challenged 5 or 6 weeks
later with 0.4 m1. of pneumonitis agent instilled intranasally and into
the conjunctival sac. It was established that between 5,000 and
10,000 EID50 of this organism regularly produced disease by this route
in susceptible animals. All vaccinated cats challenged with this con-
centration of agent developed clinical signs of feline pneumonitis
indistinguishable from those which developed in the nonvaccinated
control group. The vaccine was judged to be ineffective in protecting
animals against this disease.

SYMPOSIUM ON FELINE LEUKEMIA-SARCOMA COMPLEX

(I47a) Leukemia-Sarcoma Complex in Animals and Man
Gordon H. Theilen. D.V.M.

Davis, California

The leukemias and sarcomas of pou1try and mice are caused by
a family of RNA viruses referred to as leuko or C-type viruses. Leu-
kemia viruses infect a variety of cells, are slow to produce cell
transformation, and have a narrow range of host infectivity. Sar-
coma viruses, on the other hand, are defective, probably mutants of
leukemia viruses, readily transform cells, often have a wide host range
and usually need the leukemia virus as a “helper” in order to repli-
cate.

We isolated a cat leukemia virus that possessed properties simi-
lar to avian and murine leukemia viruses. More recently we isolated
a cat sarcoma virus that is similar to the sarcoma viruses of poultry
and mice. It has a wide host range and will induce sarcomas in
cats, dogs, rabbits, and 4 species of nonhuman primates. Thus, a
leukemia-sarcoma complex of poultry, mice, and cats has been
established. The leukemia—sarcoma complex is similar in the 3
species in which the cause has been established, which may mean
a leukemia-sarcoma complex exists in other animals and indeed in
man.

(I47d) Recent Immunologic Progress in Feline
Leukovirus Research

Myron Essex. D.V.M.. M.S., and Thomas G. Kawakami. Ph.D.

Davis, California

Immunologic techniques, including complement ﬁxation, immuno-
diffusion, immunoﬂuorescence, and cytotoxicity tests have been used
to determine the relationships among avian and murine leukoviruses.
These serologic tests, especially complement ﬁxation and immuno-
diffusion, are now being used in several laboratories, including ours,
for immunoassay and immunologic characterization of the feline leu-
kemia and sarcoma viruses.

Preliminary results suggest an antigenic relation between the
California isolates of the feline leukemia and feline ﬁbrosarcoma
viruses, both of which were isolated in our laboratory. Further stud—
ies are underway to characterize this relationship. Special emphasis
is being placed on the study of feline leukoviruses replicating from
heterospecies cell cultures.

(We) Studies on a Feline Viral Fibrosarcoma from
the Los Angeles Area

Paul Arnstein. D.V.M.. M.P.H.: Murray B. Gardner. M.D.:
Robert J. Huebner. M.D.
Berkeley and Los Angeles, California; Bethesda, Maryland

Fibrosarcomas from a Siamese cat were ﬁrst studied in 1968. Tu-
mors were sampled, found positive for C-type virus by electron mi-
croscopy, harvested, and serially passaged in cats and dogs. Under
optimal conditions, sarcoma “take” was essentially 100% in 4 passages
of tumor homogenates and parallel 4 passages of cell-free virus con-
centrates in feline fetuses and young kittens. Older cats developed
librosarcomas in 3 instances. All cats with tumors which were exam-
med by electron microscopy were positive for C-type virus in tumor,
bone marrow, salivary gland, and lymph node samples whenever
these tissues were checked.

Pups were susceptible to tumor induction, either by inoculation
of feline tumor homogenates or by inoculation of cell-free feline sar-
coma Vlrus. If inoculated in utero, the pups developed rapidly pro-
gresswe C-type virus-positive tumors. Pups inoculated when older
than 2 days, deveIOped ﬁbrosarcomas which often regressed and were

type virus negative by electron microscopy. Mature dogs devel-

Opféd nonprogressive tumors irregularly. All induced tumors in both
fellne and canine passages, involving over 100 animals with tumors,
were histologically similar ﬁbrosarcomas.

Serums of cats with tumors were negative in complement-ﬁxation
(011‘) tests against tumor extract and concentrated viral antigens. Dogs
(Wlth tumors) in which sarcomas were induced postnatally usually
developed CF antibody against homologous tumor and virus antigens,
as well as against feline lymphoma antigens. Serologic ﬁndings sug-
gest a feline lymphoma-sarcoma complex ﬁtting the pattern of tu-
morgenie C-type virus complexes in the chicken and the mouse.

(l47t) Pathogenesis of the ST-Feline Sarcoma
Stanley P. Snyderl D.V.M.I M.S.

Davis, California

Fibrosarcomas were transmitted to a large number of kittens
and to dogs, rabbits, and nonhuman primates using cell-free millipore
ﬁltrates and differential centrifugates. Associated with the tumors
of the original source cat and transmitted tumors in kittens were
large numbers of C-type Virus particles. Similar particles were no—
ticed in the tumors of some pups. The tumors induced were invari—
ably ﬁbrosarcomas. Metastatic tumors in kittens were of either a solid
or cystic type and metastases were most commonly found in skeletal
musculature, liver, and brain. Virus particles were found budding
from neoplastic cells in all metastatic tumors examined. Additional
pathogenesis studies on dose and age effects were done. These studies
help to conﬁrm the viral cause of this cat sarcoma.

(I479) Infection of Human and Animal Cells with a
Feline Leukemia Virus-Enveloped Sarcoma Virus

Timothy E. O'Connor. Ph.D.
Bethesda, Maryland

Infection of mouse cells with a murine sarcoma virus is defective
in that coinfection of a mouse cell with both mouse sarcoma virus and
mouse leukemia virus is required for cell transformation and progeny
virus production. The infective capacity of the sarcoma virus is
increased by aggregating the virus with mouse leukemia virus. An
interviral aggregate of mouse sarcoma virus and cat leukemia virus
is prepared by pelleting the virus mixture in a high speed ultracentri-
fuge. This interviral aggregate can infect and transform cat cells and
yield progeny virus consisting of a mixture of feline leukemia virus
and mouse sarcoma virus contained within feline leukemia virus
envelope. This viral mixture can infect and transform dog, pig, and
human cells and can be utilized as a detector for growth of feline

leukemia virus in these cell species.

From a larger retrospective case-control study designed to test for
an association of any feline and human cancer in the same household,
data will be presented on approximately 400 feline malignant lym—
phoma and various sarcoma case households. Findings of human can-
cer with these feline cancers were compared to human cancer oc-
currence in matched households with the same human cancer risk,
but containing cats without neoplasia. The association of these ma-

lignancies in more than one cat in a household, and the association
of feline and canine cancer together, also were studied. Using the veri—
ﬁed malignancies of cat, man, or dog in the same household, the po-
tential of natural intra- and interspecies transmission of feline onco-
genic agents was evaluated. The source of case and control households
was the Animal Neoplasm Registry in Alameda and Contra Costa
Counties, California.

\l48b) Contributions of Veterinary Medicine to
Improvement of Urban Health

J. Douglas McCluskie. D.V.M.. M.P.H.. and
Harvard E. Larson. D.V.M.. M.P.H.

Denver, Colorado

Although the veterinarian has contributed much in the ﬁeld of
.humanOhealth in the past, he has been primarily associated with the
inspectlon of foods of animal origin. Unfortunately, many veteri-
narians have limited their participation in public health to the area
of. meat inspection. Today’s growing urban problems require the
utlllzatlon of all health disciplines including the expertise of the
vetennarian. His potential contributions are much broader than that
of food inspection.

Today we are faced with increasing problems of the environment
because of increased urbanization and population explosion. Where
does today’s veterinarian ﬁt into this picture, and what can he con-
trlbute toward improving the health of man? The veterinarian can
part1c1pate in health programs most signiﬁcantly at the local level
0f government. This participation need not be limited to official em-
DlOyment, for all members of the profession have a responsibility to
thell‘ community. The veterinarian can participate in a number of
ways. The veterinarian serves as the best resource for information
on the zoonoses, is qualiﬁed for all types of food inspection, and
through care and treatment of pet animals serves in the ﬁeld of
Preventive medicine as well. Veterinary medicine must accept its
responsibility to urban health.

(l48c) Pets. Child Development. and Mental Illness

Boris M. Levinson. Ph.D.
New York, New York

Pets decrease alienation by providing communication with nature,

contact comfort, and companionship. Pets may play a crucial role

I63

 

 

 




 

 

 

in a child’s emotional development particularly in homes devoid of
affection and emotional security where they may abort mental illness.
The pet may then become the touchstone with which the child ap—
proaches himself and reality. Love for the pet creates a relationship
of mutual trust and conﬁdence while building a bridge to the future
and to greater self-awareness.

In the course of child development, emotional crises may occur.
The use of animals in therapy or as supportive aides at home may be
indicated. A group dynamic encounter is established when the pet
is part of the therapeutic constellation. The locus of therapy can be
transferred outdoors. A pet aide, particularly a dog, may satisfy the
child’s need for phsyical contact without the fear of undesirable
emotional entanglements that accompanies contact with persons. It
is easier for a child to project some of his unacceptable feelings on
a pet. The animal may also assume different roles to a child. At one
time the pet is protective and at others aggressive, and it may be
benign and benevolent in turn.

(l48ol) Toxoplasma gondii: A New Life Cycle

J. P. Dubey. M.V.Sc.. Ph.D.; N. L. Miller' 3.5.;
J. K. Frenkel. M.D.. PhD.

Kansas City, Kansas

Toxoplasma causes pneumonia, hepatitis, myocarditis, and lym-
phadenitis in animals and man. Its life cycle was not understood.
We found that oocysts resembling those of Isospora bigemina were
excreted in feces of cats fed Toxoplasma-infected mice. These iso-
sporan oocysts were identiﬁed as a stage of Toxoplasma by detailed
comparisons of oocysts and Toxoplasma infectivity numerically and
by physical, chemical, and antigenic properties. Typical coccidian
stages: schizonts, male, and female gametocytes were also found in
the intestine of kittens fed infected mouse tissues. The toxoplasma
oocysts were resistant to acids, alkalies, common laboratory disinfec-
tants, and survied for several months under moist conditions. Oocysts
were highly infectious to laboratory animals, and contact with feces
of cats with toxoplasmosis presents a special hazard.

The role of a public health veterinarian and state epidemiologist in
the Governor’s Highway Safety Program in North Carolina is pre-
sented, with special emphasis on 3 areas: the medical aspects of driver
licensing; alcohol and highway safety; and emergency medical ser-
vices. The author discusses the unique role of a veterinarian on the
Governor’s Highway Safety Advisory Committee which is composed
of 6 members representing several areas of state government. The
organization of a state-wide program is discussed from the standpoint
of administrative and epidemiologic considerations, including the
relationship to the National Highway Safety Bureau in the US. De-

(I49) Overcoming World Hunger and Population
Acceleration: Does Veterinary Medicine
Have a Role?

Ernest S. Tierkel. V.M.D., M.P.H.
Washington, DC.

There can be no question about the importance and timeliness
of the theme we have chosen for this session—the balance between
population and food supply. There is also no question about the
responsibility of veterinary medicine as a profession and veterinarians
as key members of a socially conscious scientiﬁc community for
becoming involved in the attainment of a workable balance between
the rate of human reproduction and our ability to sustain the
iannly of man.

Contributions from our profession toward achieving this balance
have already begun; but there is much more that can be done. We
{rave arranged a divergent group of speakers in the next 6 presenta-
tions who will discuss some of the many factors which must be con-

s1dered in tackling the problems of adequate nutrition and those
of alleviating the ever-mounting pressures of population growth.

(l5l) The Veterinarian in Interdisciplinary Relations:
Tradesman. Paramedic. or Professional

Patrick M. Morgan. D.V.M.. Dr.P.H.

New Orleans, Louisiana

The author brieﬂy reviews attitudes and trends of the last few
Years related to interprofessional attitudes toward the veterinary pro-
fess10n. He gives a critical appraisal of the current situation and
offers some possible reasons for the current state of affairs.

Examples of both good and bad interdisciplinary relations are
revrewed and comments are made as to how the less than satisfactory

incidents might have been modiﬁed to the best interests of the veteri-
nary profession.

Speciﬁc recommendations are made to correct some situations the
author thinks detrimental to the veterinary profession. Other sugges-
Wms or comments from the section shall be requested. A résumé of
these shall be submitted to the AVMA.

“52) Veterinary Medicine in Civil Affairs and the
World Hunger Problem

Buddy L. Reynolds. D.V.M.
Fort McClellan, Alabama

In recent years, there has been considerable interest in veterinary

MEDCAP projects which are usually medication dispensing activ-

I65

 

 

 




 

ities; however, these projects are irrelevant to the world hunger prob-
lem and the food-producing priorities of the underdeveloped nations
of the world. Since increased food animal production is a most im-
portant part of the aspirations of people in underdevelped nations
and of vital concern to people of all nations, US. military veterinary
medical input should optimally be consistent with the developmental
priorities and programs of these nations.

Major emphasis should be put on herd health programs. Special
consideration should be given to nutritional problems and day—to-day
management of improved breeds of livestock. Two programs most
amenable to receiving assistance from American military veterinary
personnel and units are: the training of paraprofessional indigenous
personnel to work in various veterinary capacities and education of
indigenous farmers to the fact that good sanitation, nutrition, and
management will increase the yield and eﬂiciency, thus increasing the
availability of more food for these countries.

Of vital concern to the success of these operations is the need for
extensive background information, to include customs, courtesies, and
techniques which are accepted in practice in other countries.

(l53) Food for the '70's

A. B. Childers, Jr.. D.V.M.
College Station, Texas

Historically, animal protein from meat animals, dairy products,
poultry products, and seafood has ﬁlled an important role in man’s
diet. The decade of the ’70’s may herald a period in which we have
more people than food on a scale not yet experienced by mankind.

The argument continues as to whether or not animal protein
sources with their inefficiency of conversion will be necessary to meet
the growing protein deﬁcit of the world’s population. Yet animal
protein contains essential amino acids not available from plant sources
and animals are able to utilize land masses unsuitable for crop
production as well as the sea to produce human food.

Veterinarians have in the past and are currently playing an
important role in programs of preventive medicine, food inspection
and hygiene, and research designed to insure an adequate, nutri-
tious, and wholesome supply of food from animal sources. There are
those who say we are wasting our time. Yet we have a vital role to
fulﬁll. Our acceptance or rejection of this responsibility will reﬂect
upon us and our profession for generations to come. We must decide
and act now, for to do nothing is to say “no.”

(I54) Center for Population Research

James F. O'Donnell. Ph.D.
Bethesda, Maryland

The ﬁghts against disease and the eradication of poverty are in-
divisibly related to the imbalance between population and resources.
Although industrial and agricultural production has increased in
many developing countries, population growth has accelerated as
public health measures which have reduced death rates have been
introduced.

Even in the United States where population problems may be less

rob- severe, signiﬁcant numbers of Americans have more children than
ons they wish simply because they do not know how to control the size
im- of their families.
ons In order to respond to the problems in a meaningful way, the
ary National Institutes of Health was given a mandate in August, 1968, to
ital establish within the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development, a Center for Population Research, to direct, coordinate,
3‘31 and conduct a national program of research and training in the pop-
lay ‘ulation area. Speciﬁc responsibilities include support of research
0st through grants and contracts on the development of new, effective,
try and safe contraceptives which are acceptable to various population
>us groups, research on the medical effects of currently used contracep-
of tives, expanded research in reproductive physiology, studies of the
nd causes and treatment of infertility, and investigation of the social,
he psychological, and demographic aspects of family planning programs.
35 USS) Physiologic Responses to Conception Control

Methods in Domestic Animals

Harold W. Hawk. Ph.D.
Beltsville, Maryland

Conception control methods are used in domestic animals for
controlling estrus and ovulation, for studying basic reproductive
processes, and for identifying the physiologic responses to contracep-
t1ve procedures being used by human beings.

The presence of a plastic spiral intrauterine device (IUD) in the
sheep uterus reverses the direction of myometrial contractions and
Prevents sperm transport and ovum fertilization; in cattle and swine,
an IUD causes the death of developing embryos. An IUD also causes
Premature corpus luteum regression in sheep and cattle, elevates endo-
metrlal vascular function, intensiﬁes the acute leukocytic response of
the uterus to bacteria or semen, increases the bactericidal and
spermmidal capabilities of the uterus, and alters the chemical composi-
tion of endometrial ground substance.

‘ Estradiol injected into the ewe after the middle of the estrous
cycle Induces the regression of corpora lutea. Estradiol also enhances
the luteolytic effect of an IUD early in the cycle.

The use of progestogen-impregnated intravaginal sponges to control
estrus 1n sheep increases the separation of sperm cells into heads and
talls 1n the vagina and decreases fertility.

quality problems confronting our nation today and in the foreseeable

(l57) Effects of Trace Elements on Human and
Animal Health

Lloyd A. Selby, D.V.M.. Dr.P.H.: Carl J. Marienteld. M.D.. M.P.H.:
James 0. Pierce. M.S.. Sc.D.

Columbia, Missouri

Trace elements abound in the environment of man and animals.
Some are essential components of biochemical functions; others are
present but are considered to be nonessential to the maintenance of
normal body functions. Certain trace substances at low concentra-
tion may be beneﬁcial, but at higher concentrations they are detri-
mental to health. There are a number of analytical methods used to
detect and evaluate trace elements in the environment, including
specialized methodologies for investigation levels in animal tissues.
Geographic variation in the distribution of trace elements may relate
to their eﬂect on health. The relationship between effect and mea-
surable exposure and intake requires further study as our knowledge,
state of the art, and measuring tools for determining subacute effects
become more sensitive.

(l59) Pesticides: Their Toxicity and Their Ecologic Impact
Emil A. Pﬁtzer. Sc.D.

Cincinnati, Ohio

The major chemical classes of pesticides have properties which
markedly inﬂuence their impact as pesticides, as mammalian intoxi-
cants, and as persistent residues in some ecosystems. Modern ana-
lytical techniques provide the ability to trace the pesticides through
their pathways for normal pest control, unwanted intoxication epi-
sodes, and the resultant occurrence in food, air, and water around
the world.

New data answer many questions, but they also present many
new questions. Are there effects on human beings due to long-term,
low-level exposure to pesticides which have heretofore been unknown?
How should decisions be made when they require scientiﬁc judgments
about that elusive negative quantity of absolute safety? Should sci-
entists or laymen make decisions when judgments of beneﬁts versus
risks are central?

The scientist and the layman of today recognize that actions taken
in the name of progress and for the good of one segment of the
human population may lead to consequences which are not necessarily
considered as progress or good by another segment of the population.

Rational decisions based on facts and legitimate concerns for the
total environment will require cahn communication between all with
knowledge about health beneﬁts, health risks, and ecologic impacts
from the use of pesticides.

Rockville, Maryland

There .is an ever-increasing interest in the possibility that the
use or misuse of drugs in food-producing animals may result in
adulteration from drug residues of edible products derived from such
animals. The Food and Drug Administration determines prior to
approval that each new drug, or combination of drugs, can be used
m a way which will not result in drug residues in tissues. This is
done by having adequate res1due data submitted as part of the new

(I63) Military Consumer Protection

Donald W. Ringley, D.V.M.. M.P.H.
Washington, DC.

Air Force veterinarians direct a unique world-wide military con-
sumer protection program. This program includes following food
products from the feedlot or ﬁeld to ultimate consumption by the
consumer. Sanitary standards for slaughter and food-processing plants
are important and part of the program. However, experience in-
dicates that in today’s environment the crucial points in consumer
protection are in the distribution system and at the commissary
and dining hall level. To this end the Air Force has developed a
consumer quality level program, a closely monitored food service
sanitation program complete with public health education for food
service personnel and a cooperative program with the Federal Food
and Drug Administration for the establishment of microbiologic
standards for certain convenience foods.

(I64) Sate Use ot Pesticides on Livestock

James L. Hourriganl D.V.M.
H yattsville, Maryland

The large-scale practical usage of pesticides is one of the signiﬁcant
technologic developments of the 20th century. Although animal health
and public health veterinarians have been involved for decades in the
use of pesticides, we ﬁnd that some of the practices followed and
pesticides used in the past are no longer acceptable to the public
or to ourselves.

We see considerable opposition to particular chemicals which
.have been our main line of defense and have been very effective.
We ﬁnd ourselves turning to less persistent pesticides and those which
do not leave residues in meat and milk.

Our goal is safe, effective pest control. The pesticides we do use
must be chosen and applied with considerable care so as to avoid
tissue residues greater than established tolerances, or toxicity to live-
stock or persons applying the pesticide. Unused pesticides and con-
tainers must be disposed of in a manner to avoid contamination
of the environment.

- .~,—\, ,—

 

Test results established “in-place” warehouse fumigation with
aluminum phosphide under light weight polyethylene ﬁlms as a highly
efﬁcacious and efﬁcient technique for control of stored-product in-
festation. Effective control was recorded in a Wide range of com-
modities, with varied packing and packaging, against a variety of
insect species selected both for known tolerance to standard procedures
and for history of infestation incidence.

The efficacy of the fumigation procedure can be estimated ac-
curately by minimal monitoring of gas concentrations under the
polyethylene tarp. Signiﬁcantly, fumigation can be conducted safely
in-place, without restricting access to the area and without disruption
of normal warehouse activities. This procedure is equally efﬁcacious
where inside storage is not available.

In conjunction with fumigation procedures, the warehouse space
application of dichlorvos vapor as a “preventive” measure was highly
effective in controlling incipient warehouse infestations. During a 12—
month test, experimental use of these procedures at a major military
subsistence depot resulted in a 98% reduction of commodity tonnage
infested.

(I66) Human Toxicity Resulting from Pesticide Use
Victor B. Beat. D.V.M.

Iowa City, Iowa

It has been recognized that most pesticide poisonings go undiag-
nosed. A concerted effort has been made to evaluate every sick
person encountered with a history of pesticide exposure. Three factors
1n tox101ty are: (1) inherent toxicity of the compound, (2) high con-
centration for a short time, and (3) low concentration for a long time.
It is recognized that repeated short exposures may result in poisoning.
Exposure to products dispensed by veterinarians as well as commonly
used pesticides may produce illness. Examples of those products
3T9: atgard, equigard, task, no pest strips and ﬂea collars. Primary
routes .of exposure are oral, respiratory, and dermal. Use caution
to mlmmize exposure. Cooperation with the medical doctor is essen-
t1a1 1n pesticide poisoning. Slides will show median lethal dosages and
some types of exposure. Case histories will be reported.

U67) Development of Transferable Drug Resistance
in Salmonella and Its Public Health Implications

Robert A. Baldwin. D.V.M.. M.S.
Annandale, Virgina

Transferable drug resistance is the transfer of antimicrobial resis-
tance from one bacterium to another by cell-to—cell contact. This type
of resistance has also been referred to as infectious drug resistance,
contagious drug resistance, and multiple drug resistance. It is a resis-
tance Which is transferred by genetic material, deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA), during bacterial cell mating or conjugation. It is sometimes
multiple, simultaneously transferring resistance to several unrelated
antibiotics. It is knOwn to occur only among gram-negative entero-
bacteria such as Salmonella, Escherichia, and Proteus. Both inter- and

intraspecies transfer of this resistance has been reported. The public
health implications of this phenomenon concern the Food and Drug
Administration for 2 reasons: resistant organisms in animals may
be transferred to man by direct contact or through contaminated
food; and by continued exposure to antibiotic residues in food, the
frequency of resistance transfer may be, increased in persons con-
suming such food.

(I69) Use of Supplemental Tests in the Diagnosis
and Control of Hog Cholera

S. H. Young. D.V.M.

Roanoke, Indiana

The early detection of hog cholera is essential to the hog cholera
eradication program. Most of the infections disclosed at this stage
of the eradication efforts are of the chronic nature. The high mor-
bidity and mortality usually associated with the disease is either
delayed or completely absent. Transmission between animals in a
herd may be extremely slow in comparison to the usual concept of
viral spread. The clinical signs and postmortem ﬁndings are obscure
and often confused with other. disease conditions. The secondary
disease conditions associated with the viral infection may be essentially
the only ﬁndings observed. Hog cholera may not be considered until
after treatment has been found to be unsuccessful.

Dependable diagnostic tests for the early detection of hog cholera
have been developed. Utilization of the ﬂuorescent antibody (FA)
test, histologic examination of brain tissue and white blood cell counts
in conjunction with the history, clinical signs, and postmortem ﬁndings
enables an accurate diagnosis. The ﬂuorescent antibody, serum-
neutralization (FASN) test for the detection of serum antibody against
hog cholera can be used for detecting the presence or absence of past
exposure to hog cholera virus. This can be useful both as a diagnostic
aid and in traceback work.

(I72) Modern Transportation as an Instrument in
the Spread of Livestock Diseases

F. W. Hansen. Jr.. D.V.M.
H yattsville, Maryland

_ Transportation has always been a factor in the spread of livestock
dlseases. It is the scope and potential of such spread that is changing.
As different types of transportation develop and the speed of trans-
portation increases, the greater the distances the spread of disease
may occur and the chances of spread of diseases not known to an
area become greater.

Transportation will be an instrument in disease spread to the ex-
tent it permits exposure to occur, to the extent it conveys disease
organisms, and the rapidity with which transportation is conducted.
Trends in domestic transportation indicate a probable reduction in
exposure hazards in the future, and stress will become less of a factor
than at present. Increased air transportation of animals, man, and
products increases the danger of introducing foreign disease. Carriers
and containers are a potential risk, but play a minor role in the
actual dissemination of disease. The veterinary profession faces a
challenge to meet the needs of the future if it is to maintain its
position as the principal barrier against the transportation of disease.

Regulatory Veterinary Medicine—Second Session

( I73) A Data Retrieval System for Disease and
Administrative lntormation

Norman E. HuttonI D.V.M.; Wayne D. Yoder, D.V.M.:
Stanley L. Lahm. B.S.

Ames, Iowa

A computerized data retrieval system has been developed for use
at Diagnostic Services, Animal Health Division, U.S. Department of
Agriculture. This system combines the recording and retrieval of
both administrative and disease data. A decision was made to separate
the recording of in-depth research data from the administrative infor-
mation. This has proved to be a satisfactory approach and has
provided ﬂexibility.

The prime concerns in developing the system were simplicity, ease
of operation, being able to obtain information readily and minimizing
the cost of installing the system.

All aspects of the system will be discussed. This will include the
internal forms used for systematically gathering the data, the coding
of the information, the key punching, the computer processing, the
reports prepared, and the costs of the system.

(I75) Regulatory Veterinary Medicine and the
Nation's Farm Animals

W. L. Bendix. D.V.M.

Richmond, Virginia

This paper considers reports of a dearth of veterinarians concerned
with the care and treatment of livestock important in food and ﬁber
production. The validity of such reports, which indicate a serious
and growing trend of veterinarians away from “farm practice,” is
examined in various regions and in the country as a whole.

Continuation of this trend, in the author’s view, must be accom-
panied by increasing seriousness. How far it may go and the end
result , of critical deterioration of the “farm practice” situation are
considered in relationship to the agricultural economy. The possibility
of regulatory veterinary medicine being drawn into the picture is
explored. The author questions the desirability of regulatory involve-
ment, as it would concern the livestock economy, the farmer, and the
regulatory functions of regulatory veterinary medicine.

Possibilities of forestalling or counteracting the trend and correct-
ing the conditions which brought it about are explored, and the
underlying causes are investigated. Based upon his ﬁndings the author
presents his recommendations and suggestions.

Background information was sought and received from a large
number of correspondents throughout the country, and the paper
represents a distillate of the author’s thinking with that of his
correspondents.

(I77) The Value of Graduate Training in Epidemiology
and Preventive Medicine to Regulatory Veterinarians

John C. Sawyer. D.V.M.. M.P.V.M.

Davis, California

Regulatory veterinarians are charged With the responsibility of
developing and conducting programs for control, eradication, and
prevention of disease and conditions devastating to the nations’ live-
stock. Fulﬁlling this obligation requires more than maintaining
knowledge of the basic medical disciplines, disease control regulations,
and speciﬁc disease program procedures. There is an obligation to be
a part of and thereby sensitive to the needs of a dynamic livestock
industry.

This sensitivity and responsiveness cannot be received and inter-
preted only at the level of the directors of such large programs. There
must be awareness and an incentive to search for answers from within.
Recognizing this, the Animal Health Division, USDA, has conducted

basic epidemiologic orientation courses and sent veterinarians to

universities for graduate study. This led to the development of a

speciﬁcally designed graduate program in epidemiology and preventive
medicine.

. The response to this program by the university, the students, and
d1sease control agencies has indicated that each has something to learn
from the other and that this is a promising relationship.

The value of this training to the regulatory veterinarian extends
beyond the application of his new knowledge in methodology to a

renewed interest and incentive and to a greater awareness of the com-
mon goals.

Salmonellosis, a disease of animals and man, has come into world-
wide focus. A rapid and accurate means by which salmonellae can
be found in animal by-products, feed, and animal tissues is required.
The application of the ﬂuorescent antibody (FA) technique appears
to present a solution to the problem. A discussion of an FA conjugate
and its application to animal feeds, animal by-products, and swine
tissues Will be presented.

(I79) Modern Concept of Poultry Disease Eradication

Harry E. Golds’rein. D.V.M.
Columbus, Ohio

The history of poultry disease control and eradication programs
has had a most interesting evolution over the years. This evolution
has recorded on-the-farm efforts involving individual small ﬂock
operations to completely integrated programs involving millions of
birds.

The poultry industry throughout the years has depended upon
institutions of learning, experiment stations, commercial pharma-
ceutical and biological interests, and extension services when en-
countering disease problems. The veterinary practitioner has not been
too active in this ﬁeld. The state regulatory veterinarian has not been
consulted and has not provided the services to gain the conﬁdence
of the poultry industry.

Poor communications have provided the problem. Extensive ef-
forts to provide good communications can change the attitude and,
with time, create a more optimum result.

(I80) Diagnosis of Equine Infectious Anemia by
Agar-Gel Immunodifiusion Test
Leroy Coggins. D.V.M.. Ph.D.; Neal L. Norcross. Ph.D.;
Sidney R. Nusbaum. D.V.M.
Ithaca, New York

A novel antigen, speciﬁc for equine infectious anemia (EIA), ap-
peared in the spleens of ponies peracutely infected with EIA virus. This
speciﬁc antigen combined with antibody in serum from EIA-infected
horses to form a precipitin line in an agar-gel immunodiffusion reac-
tion. The antigen was detectable in spleens collected 9 to 11 days
after inoculation from ponies with very severe clinical illness. A
lower level of antigen was present in spleens taken earlier or later
in the illness and was often not detectable in animals with only mild
clinical symptoms.

Speciﬁc EIA antibody was detected in a few animals at 18 days post-
inoculation and was present in most horses at 21 days postinoculation.
Levels of antibody increased with time especially in those animals
repeatedly injected with virulent EIA virus. One pony known to be
infected for over 3 years maintained. its antibody during this period.
The various isolates of EIA virus had no detectable antigenic differences
and no cross reactions occurred with antsierums against equine abor-
tion virus, equine arteritis virus, African horse-sickness virus, or
equine piroplasmosis.

In the development of a diagnostic test for EIA the immunodiffusion
reaction was used to identify EIA antibody in the serum of horses sus-
pected of having the disease. A positive diagnosis was made when a
line of identity formed between the control EIA antigen and the sus-
pect serum which joined the control precipitin line. A plan was
prepared to test the premise that the presence of EIA antibody in a
horse was sufﬁcient evidence to indicate infection with EIA virus, except
in cases of passive transfer of antibody such as maternal antibody in
the young foal.

I76

 

 




Blood samples from both experimentally infected ponies and
horses involved in ﬁeld epizootics of EIA were examined for the presence
of antibody with the agar-gel immunodiffusion test and for the presence
of virus by inoculation into susceptible ponies. The results were ﬁtted
to a statistical analysis formula to determine the accuracy of the
immunodiifusion test in detecting infected animals as ascertained from
observations of experimentally inoculated ponies. The analysis re-
vealed that the agar-gel immunodiﬂ'usion test was an accurate indi-
cator of EIA infection in horses. It is therefore concluded that the
ﬁnding of a speciﬁc antigen and antibody has made it possible to
devise a simple, accurate, and inexpensive diagnostic test for EIA.

(l8l) Federal Requirements for Canine
Viral Vaccines

Marvin T. Got-F. D.V.M.

Ames, Iowa

The federal government requires that certain tests be made on
vaccines sold in interstate commerce. Potency, safety, and sterility
assays on ﬁnished vaccines have long been required. A new concept
has been implemented—testing of seed virus from which vaccines are
made. For canine distemper and infectious canine hepatitis this
new concept is now in effect. Testing requirements for rabies vaccine
seed Virus are being developed.

This report discusses seed virus testing and ﬁnished vaccine
testing for canine distemper, infectious canine hepatitis, and rabies
vaccmes to be used in dogs.

(I 82) Progress of the Cooperative State-Federal Inspection
Programs Under the Wholesome Meat Act

James K. PayneI D.V.M.. M.S.
Washington, DC.

The Wholesome Meat Act which was passed on Dec. 15, 1967, gave
the states 2 to 3 years in which to develop inspection programs that
are equal to federal requirements. The Act also provides for close
cooperation and assistance by the US. Department of Agriculture in
working with states to enable them to develop their programs within
the tlme allotted. The federal government is authorized to pay up
to 50% of the cost of state inspection programs.

The states have made much progress since the Wholesome Meat
Act was enacted. Since that time, all of the states have passed manda-
tory inspection laws. Twenty-one states passed legislation in 1969.
They have all entered into cooperative agreements with the US.
Department of Agriculture and are receiving matching funds. Addi—
tional supplemental agreements have been signed with several states.
State inspection program expenditures have increased by over $25

million, and full-time inspection personnel have more than doubled.
The states continue to have difﬁculties in ﬁlling veterinary positions.

Procedures have been developed for evaluating and certifying state
systems. These criteria were developed in consultation with the
National Food Inspection Advisory Committee.

First Session

(l83‘) Characterization of the Immune Response of
Turkeys to Mycoplasma meleagridis

Stanley H. Kleven, D.V.M., Ph.D., and
Beniamin S. Pomeroy. D.V.M.. Ph.D.
Athens, Georgia, and St. Paul, Minnesota

Studies on the serologic response of turkeys after artiﬁcial inocula-
tion with M ycoplasma meleagridis indicated that antibodies of high
molecular weight (IgM) were produced within 4 to 6 days after
inoculation. Low molecular weight antibodies (IgG) were not detected
until 10 to 14 days postinoculation. After 3 to 4 weeks postinoculation,
circulating antibodies consisted primarily of IgG, although detectable
levels of IgM persisted. Fractionation of selected serums with sephadex
G200 and treatment of serums with 2-mercaptoethanol indicated that
the serum plate agglutination test is more efﬁcient in the detection
of IgM than in the detection of IgG antibodies. Tube agglutination
tests measured both types of antibodies, whereas the hemagglutination-
inhibition test detected only IgG.

Poults infected with M. meleagridis as 19-day embryos exhibited
serum plate agglutination titers at one week of age, but tube agglu-
tination titers were not detected until 3 weeks of age. Hemagglutina-
tion inhibition and 2-mercaptoethanol-resistant tube agglutination titers
did not appear until 6 weeks of age. Thus, poults infected as embryos
have an early but depressed IgM response, and the IgG response is
delayed until 6 weeks of age.

(I84) Detection of Mycoplasma meleagridis in Turkeys
by Culture of Sinus Washings Compared with
Serum Plate Agglutination

Christopher H. Bigland, D.V.M., D.V.P.H., M.Sc.:

R. D. Crawford, PhD.

Saskatchewan, Saskatoon

The culture of sinus washings from turkeys naturally infected with
M ycoplasma meleagridis detected carriers of the organism even when
serum plate agglutination tests were negative. This technique adds
another tool to the M. meleagridis testing program.

Of 1,004 samplings, a combination of both sinus culture and plate
agglutination tests detected the highest number of positive birds (47%)
compared with sinus culture alone (21%) or serologic testing alone
(31%)- '

Positive cultures from sinus washings were not obtained from either
male or female turkeys during the breeding season despite isolations
of 29% in 661 samples in the prebreeding period and 14% of 99
samples in the postbreeding period.

(l85) Significant Factors in the Control of
Mycoplasma meleagridis

R. Yamamoto. Ph.D.. and Herrard B. Ortmayer. B.S.

Davis, California

Several parameters were studied to develop data applicable in the
control of M ycoplasma meleagridis infection in turkeys. Genital in-
fection detected at 1 day of age persisted through sexual maturity in
males and females infected initially by vertical transmission. Of the
2 modes of infection, vertical or horizontal, the latter played a rela-
tively minor role in potentially or ultimately contributing to egg-
borne infection. In 2 experiments (I and II) in which the mode of
infection was horizontal (i.e., contact), genital carriers were detected
in 0.0% (0/36) and 2.3% (3/128), respectively, of birds studied from
time of hatch to sexual maturity. In 2 experiments (IIIA and IVA)
in which infection was initiated by vertical transmission (i.e., egg-
borne), the genital carrier rates were 24% (6/24) and 32% (8/25),
respectively. The agglutination test detected a majority of the genital
carriers infected by either route when tests were conducted at approxi-
‘mately 10 weeks of age. In 2 small-scale experiments (IIIB and IVB)
111 which late season eggs were double-dipped in tylosin solution
(3,000 ppm), genital carriers were not detected in 22 and 91 birds,
respectively. However, in a ﬁeld study (V) utilizing treatment pro-
cedure, a serologic reactor rate of 3.6% was detected in 596 poults
tested at 6 weeks of age, and genital carriers were detected in 4 of
the 13 reactors. It was concluded from this and other studies that a
program to produce M. meleagridis-free turkeys must consider: (1)
dlpplng of hatching eggs in antibiotic solution to reduce the incidence
of infection to minimal levels, (2) sanitary procedures during sexing
to prevent possible mechanical transmission of infection present in
the cloaca of poults at hatching, (3) serologic testing and removal
of reactors during the early growing period, and (4) cultural proce-

iures at sexual maturity to detect genital carriers not detected by
serology.

U87) Occurrence. Characteristics. and Potential
Pathogenicity of Serotype I Avian Mycoplasma

Julius Fabricant. V.M.D.. PhD.
Ithaca, New York

Mycoplasma of avian serotype I were ﬁrst reported and described
from turkeys and chickens. A large number of isolates made at this
laboratory indicate that this organism is widely distributed in turkeys

and not uncommon in chickens. Most of these isolations were made
from dead-in-shell or pipped turkey embryos or day-old turkey poults
from ﬂocks in which M ycoplasma meleagridis was also present. Grossly
Visible respiratory tract lesions were common in such embryos or
poults. Serotype I mycoplasma were demonstrated to persist in the
respiratory tract of poults raised from naturally infected hatches for
as long as 16 weeks. The heavy rate of egg transmission of these
organisms and their occurrence in association with lesions in embryos
and poults suggest that these mycoplasma are pathogens. Mycoplasma

I79

 

 

 

 




previously described as serotypes I, J, K, N, Q, and R belong to a
single group which share common serologic components in varying
degrees but are completely distinct from other avian mycoplasma. The
group also shares biochemical and biophysical characteristics, some
of which are unique to this group. The most important of these
characteristics is the ability to grow in the presence of a 1% concen-
tration of bile salts.

(I88) Intestinal Microtlora of Turkeys Infected with
Infectious Enteritis (Bluecomb Disease) Agent

Syecl A. Naqi. B.V.Sc.&A.H.. Ph.D.: Charles F. Hall. D.V.M., M.S.:
Donald H. Lewis. Ph.D.
College Station, Texas

The purpose of this study was to develop techniques for the study
of the intestinal microﬂora in avian species and to compare the intesti-
nal microﬂora of turkeys challenged with infectious enteritis agent
to that of uninoculated control turkeys. Studies were conducted with
birds of various ages from 1 day to 8 weeks.

Studies with apparently healthy turkey poults revealed that the
alimentary tract is invaded by several bacterial species soon after
hatching. Such organisms multiplied extensively and reached very
high levels within 24 to 72 hours posthatching. However, subsequent
to this early rise the bacterial numbers slowly decreased and charac-
teristic intestinal microﬂora was established early in life.

Signiﬁcant differences were noticed in the intestinal microﬂora of
turkeys inoculated with the infectious enteritis agent. The changes
were characterized by: (1) a rise in the total microbial count of the
entire intestines, (2) a signiﬁcant increase in the number of putrefac-
tive and potentially pathogenic organisms, (3) a decrease in the lacto-
bacilli count in the presence of severe infectious enteritis, and (4) an
increase in the number of lactobacilli in mild cases of infectious

enteritis.

(I89) Effect of Avian Influenza-A Viruses upon Egg
Production and Fertility in Turkeys

Davis, California

Two Avian inﬂuenza-A viruses, namely T/Calif/meleagrium/64
and T/Calif/5142/ 66, isolated from turkeys with mild respiratory
signs and a drop in egg production were studied under experimental
conditions.

Exposure of turkeys by the intravenous and intratracheal routes
to both strains of the virus resulted in a decrease in fertility and egg
production. The effect of the virus was conﬁrmed by an experiment
in which insemination of turkeys with semen contaminated with the
virus resulted in a drastic decrease in fertility and a drop in produc-
tion.

and Flowery Branch, Georgia

Epidemiologic procedures were presented illustrating methods to
determine sites of contamination and modes of transmission to the
ﬁnished product. Decontamination and processing procedures were
evaluated.

Not only was Salmonella eliminated from the plant, but total
bacterial counts were effectively reduced.

ﬂ‘ill Isolation of a Reovirus from Bursa of Fabricius of
Chickens Affected by Infectious Bursal Disease

Emil F. Gelenczei. D.V.M.. Ph.D.. and Philip D. Lunger. Ph.D.

M illsboro, Delaware, and Newark, Delaware

Virus isolations were made from chickens affected by infectious
bursal disease (IBD) . Infectious bursal agent (IBA) was isolated from
the bursa of Fabricius by chicken embryo inoculation. Five isolates
were obtained from different geographical areas. The isolates showed
tipllial characteristics of IBA inoculated into chicken embryos and
c c ens.

_However, all isolates changed their original characteristics following
serial passages in certain avian cell cultures. These changes were
best observed in embryonic chicken liver and kidney cell cultures.
There was no or slight neutralization of these cell cultures by IBD-
lmmune serum. The size and morphology of the tissue culture (TC) -
adapted isolates, as demonstrated by the electron microscope, and
then resistance to various physical and chemical treatments was
identical to that of the avian reoviruses. Furthermore, these isolates
produced pock-type lesions on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM)
cf chicken embryos.

Nevertheless, the isolates propagated in embryonic chicken and
duck ﬁbroblast cells and demonstrated all characteristics that are typi-
cal of BA. These TC-adapted virus strains were signiﬁcantly neutralized
by IBD-immune serum. They did not develop pock-like lesions on the
CAM. Electron microscopy revealed that the morphology of the virus
particles was identical to that of IBA.

These observations indicate that the reovirus is a common inhabi-
tant in chickens. In the epornitics of infectious bursal disease investi-
gated, a mixed infection of IBA and a reovirus was present in the bursa
of Fabricius. The two virus species were separated by certain tissue
culture techniques and identiﬁed.

(I92) Growth and Characterization of the Infectious
Bursal Agent in Cell Cultures

Phil D. Lukert, D.V.M.. Ph.D.. and R. B. Davis. D.V.M.
Athens, Georgia

The infectious bursal agent (IBA) was grown in cells derived from
the bursa of Fabricius and from kidneys. Initial growth and adapta-
tion was performed in bursal cells and infection of the bursal cultures
was detected by cytopathology and immunoﬂuorescence. Cytopathol-
ogy was not readily observable in kidney cell cultures but infection
could be detected by immunoﬂuorescence. Cultures infected with IBA
were resistant to challenge with Newcastle disease virus. Virus could
be quantitated by counting infected foci at 24 hours, using immuno-
ﬂuorescent staining. The virus was characterized as to the site of
replication, nucleic acid type, ether and pH sensitivity, and approxi-
mate size. Serums were evaluated for the presence of antibody, using
the quantitative procedure described.

Poultry—Second Session

(I93) Filtered Air and Positive Pressure To Produce
Poultry Flocks Free of Disease

Charles W. Beard. D.V.M.. Ph.D.: L. N. Drury. M.S.:

David P. Anderson. D.V.M.. Ph.D.: Caswell S. Eidson. PhD.
Athens, Georgia

The isolation principles of ﬁltered air and positive pressure were
adapted to poultry ﬂock rearing and maintenance at the USDA
Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory. Five conventional poultry
houses were modiﬁed during the past 4 years by installing ﬁltered-air,
positive pressure (FAPP) ventilation systems.

Respiratory diseases, including Newcastle disease and infectious
bronchitis, have been prevented in 10 nonvaccinated ﬂocks over the
4-year period. Epizootics of infectious bronchitis were an annual oc-
currence prior to the housing modiﬁcation. Observations on mortality,
postmortem examinations, serologic ﬁndings, and Virus isolation at-
tempts indicate the absence of Marek’s disease in ﬂocks brooded and
raised under the FAPP ventilation system. Several ﬂocks in nearby
conventional houses were positive for Marek’s disease using the same
criteria.

A FAPP house was constructed at the University of Georgia Poultry
Disease Research Center that included additional modiﬁcations. It
has housed 2 ﬂocks in the immediate vicinity of ﬂocks with very high
mortality to Marek’s disease. Evidence of Marek’s disease was not
found in the FAPP ﬂocks.

The FAPP principle has been successfully applied to a much larger
commercial poultry house with encouraging results.

Athens, Georgia

Chickens exposed to Marek’s disease agent either by contact or

m intra-arterial inoculation of whole blood from infected donor birds
51- (Ga isolate) rapidly become infected regardless of age at time of
es exposure. Ages at time of exposure were 1 day, 5, 10, and 15 weeks.

In from whole blood onto chicken kidney cell monolayers or direct cell
3A culture of the kidneys, agar gel precipitin test, and gross and micro-
ld scopic pathology.

(I95) Factors Influencing Intectivity of Dust and Litter
Containing the Marek's Disease Agent

- Poultry litter has been shown to induce Marek’s disease in chicks,
With an incidence and lesion pattern comparable to that induced by
inoculation of infective whole blood. This report deals with separa-
tion of different components of litter and ambient dust. Methods of
bioassay, including procedures in handling the particulate material,
administering it to chicks, and assessing its effect in recipients will
be reported. Effect on infectiousness by physical treatments of litter
Including exposure to ultraviolet light, different temperatures, and
x-irradiation will also be reported. Although infective litter was easily
obtained from chickens with artiﬁcially induced Marek’s disease,
sources from the ﬁeld even from houses with high losses appeared to
be very erratic in the amount of infective material they contained. It
appeared that infectious litter maintained oncogenicity for at least 4
to 5 months after the time it was ﬁrst collected. Reasons for the slow
loss of activity will be discussed from the standpoint of the natural
mode of transmission. A comparison with other Viral diseases and

implications for practical control measures of Marek’s disease will
be made.

Parameters of infection and their relationship to disease were
studied throughout a 76-week period in a ﬂock of 100 White Leghorn
chickens naturally exposed to Marek’s disease (MD) under ﬁeld condi-

tions. When initially tested at 8 weeks, 81% of the ﬂock was positive
for antibody and 17% had detectable viremias. Examination of blood
samples obtained monthly from each bird showed that the proportion
of birds positive by virus isolation and serologic tests remained rela-
tively constant despite the occurrence of 33% mortality from MD.
Birds with early (8-12 weeks) or persistent (50% of samples) viremias
were, respectively, 3 or 17 times more likely to develop MD than birds
lacking these characteristics. Viruses isolated either early or late
from birds which survived the experiment and lacked MD lesions were
less pathogenic than viruses isolated from birds dying of MD. Some
survivor birds were able to transmit the disease by direct contact and
this ability appeared correlated with the presence of cutaneous virus
or viral antigen. Quantitative relationships of antibody development
to disease were studied for selected individual chickens.

(I97) Studies on the Diagnosis and Biology of
Marek's Disease Virus

Vicco von Biilow. Dr. med. vet.
Tiibingen, Germany

A recently developed embryo test has proved to be a speciﬁc and
practicable method for the diagnosis of Marek’s disease (MD) virus
infections. Infected cells were inoculated into the yolk sac of 4-day-old
chicken embryos. Numerous pocks appearing on the chorioallantoic
membrane at 9 to 12 days postinfection were the characteristic signs
of a MD infection. The test was working with blood cells as well as
with tissue culture cells. Embryos from different sources were not
equally susceptible. Graft versus host reactions could be excluded.

The MD-associated antigens were demonstrated with direct FA
tests in chickens, embryos, and cell cultures.

Serial embryo passages of MD virus could be done using susceptible
embryos free from MD antibodies. The highest virus yields were in
the embryo spleen and bursa of Fabricius. Embryo passages of a
classic MD virus resulted in the loss of pathogenicity for chickens. The
inoculated birds became viremic, shed the virus, developed precipitating
antibodies, and were resistant against challenge with acute MD. There
was no serologic evidence for any antigenic alteration of the embryo-
passaged MD virus.

The same tissues from S-line chickens infected with the J M strain
of Marek’s disease virus were examined by the ﬂuorescent antibody
(FA) and agar gel precipitin (AGP) tests and by electron microscopy
(EM). In vitro virus assays of cellular and cell-free materials from
some of the tissues were done. All samples of feather follicle epi-
thelium were positive for antigen detectable by FA and AGP, contained

large numbers of both naked and enveloped herpesvirus particles,
and were the source of infectious, cell-free virus. The bursa of
Fabricius, kidneys, leukotic gonad, and nerve plexuses also contained
FA-detectable antigen but not so consistently or extensively as did
the feather follicle epithelium. All of these tissues, except kidney
tissues, were found positive by the AGP test and were determined by
EM to be infected, but nearly all virus particles were naked and intra-
nuclear. In vitro virus assays showed infectivity to be cell associated.

Cornell White Leghorns were housed in Horsfall units with birds
previously exposed by contact to other birds inoculated with the GA
isolate. Control birds were housed in separate Horsfall units. Groups
of control and contact-exposed birds were killed and examined for
{loss and microscopic lesions at weekly intervals beginning with the
ﬁrst and continuing through the eighth week posthatching. Kidneys

tumors were found in the ovary of 1 exposed bird at 7 weeks and in
the kidneys, liver, and spleen of 1 bird at 8 weeks. Microscopic lesions,
consrstlng of perivascular cuﬂ’ing by mononuclear lymphoreticular cells,
were found in the brains of contact-exposed birds at 4 through 8 weeks.
Lymphoid foci were found in the kidneys and similar foci found in
the skin at 5 through 8 weeks in exposed birds. Lymphoreticular cell

groiliferation was detected at 7 and 8 weeks in the gonads of exposed
bir s.

(MD) .lS hmited to cytopathic effect (CPE) or ﬂuorescent antibody (FA)

another research tool in the study of MD. Anti-MD antiserum was pre-

pared in chickens tolerant to chick kidney cells. Anti-sheep red blood
cell antiserum was prepared in chickens. Anti-chicken antiserum was
prepared in rabbits. Infected chick kidney cultures were allowed to
react with anti-MD antiserum for 30 minutes, followed by rabbit anti-
chicken antiserum for 30 minutes and ﬁnally by sheep red blood
cells coated with chicken anti-sheep red blood cell antiserum. Areas
of hemadsorption were counted. This method of detecting virus infected
centers can then be compared to the CPE and FA techniques.

(ZOI) Monitoring Poultry Vaccines for Lymphoid
Leukosis Biocontamination

Dale D. Oshel. D.V.M., M.S.: D. R. Wenger. D.V.M.; T. A. Koski. B.S.

Ames, Iowa

A 3-phase program was inaugurated in 1968 for licensed manufac-
turers of live-virus poultry vaccines to (1) test master seed viruses for
freedom from lymphoid leukosis (LL) viruses, (2) develop LL-free ﬂocks
for sources of fertile eggs for vaccine production, and (3) test bulk
and ﬁnished vaccines by the complement ﬁxation for avian leukosis
test (COFAL) for possible biocontamination.

Progress has been made in all 3 phases. Effective Oct. 1, 1969,
weekly tests on material representing each egg source ﬂock for licensed
live virus poultry vaccines must be tested. Each weekly check test must
be COFAL-negative for LL virus, subgroups A and B, for that week’s
production to be eligible for release for marketing. If the weekly check
test is positive for COFAL activity, then each serial produced from that
source ﬂock must be tested negative prior to release.

The Veterinary Biologics Division has adapted the COFAL test for
use in testing poultry biologics and has monitored bulk and ﬁnal
container samples of poultry vaccines. The Division has provided
training sessions for technical personnel of all licensed manufacturers
of poultry vaccines.

A few vaccine samples produced from virus material harvested
prior to 1967 from untested ﬂocks are positive for COFAL activity. Vac-
cine samples produced with eggs from ﬂocks with COFAL-negative tests
for LL have also been uniformly negative for COFAL activity.

(202) Salmonella Growth Curves as Related to
Isolation Methodology

Virginia L. Carlson. M.S.. and G. H. Snoeyenbos. D.V.M.

Amherst, Massachusetts

The growth curves of Salmonella typhimurium were determined in
T83, TBG, and SBGS broth inoculated with 10 to 100 viable organisms / ml.
and incubated at 37 and 43 C. Salmonella and “nonsalmonella” growth
curves were determined in contaminated poultry litter incubated at
the 2 temperatures in the selective mediums.

In pure cultures the log phase was approximately 4 times longer
in TBG than in SBGS or TSB; the generation time was approximately 3
times longer in TBG and SBGS than in T83. There were shifts in the
length of log phase and generation time of S. typhimurium in poultry
litter cultured in TBG and SBGS. The “nonsalmonellae” reached a lower
peak population and often declined at a more rapid rate than did
S. typhimurium.

The incubation temperature did not greatly inﬂuence peak S.
typhimurium populations. The presence of competing organisms de-
creased peak populations of the bacterium by one or more logs.

It appears that if single plates are to be made from either TBG or
SBGS selective broth, the optimum time for plating is 24 to 36 hours
after the mediums have reached incubation temperature.

(204) Effect of Novobiocin on Fowl Cholera in Turkeys

A. H. Hamcly, D.V.M.. Ph.D.. and C. J. Blanchard. B.S.
Kalamazoo, Michigan

Fowl cholera is a systemic disease affecting turkeys, chickens, and
other species of fowl. Since commercial vaccines showed variable re-
sults in protecting birds against fowl cholera, an effective therapeutic
agent is needed to control this important disease of poultry. Novobiocin
was evaluated against fowl cholera both in vitro and in vivo.

Novobiocin was active in vitro against 12 of 13 strains of Pasteurella
multocida that were originally isolated from ﬁeld cases of fowl cholera.
The minimal inhibitory concentration ranged from 0.5 to 8.0 Jug/ml.
with an average of 2.0 Mg/ml. The minimal bactericidal concentration
ranged from 0.5 to 10 pg./ml. with an average of 2.8 ng./ml.

Novobiocin feed or water medication was effective in reducing death
losses in turkeys following severe experimental infections of P. mul-
focida under controlled conditions. N ovobiocin water medication (1
Gm./gal. for 7 days) reduced the average death loss from 82.5 to 6.6%.
Novobiocin mixed in the feed at the rate of 350 Gm. /ton for 7 days
was also effective in reducing death losses in turkeys both experimen-
tally and naturally infected with fowl cholera. The mortality rate

was reduced signiﬁcantly after novobiocin medication.

(205) Persistence and Multiplication of Erysipelothrix
insidiosa in the Turkey

R. E. Corstvet, Ph.D.: C. A. Holmberg. D.V.M.: Janet Riley. B.S.
Stillwater, Oklahoma

Investigations were conducted to determine the effect of vaccination
and medication (procaine penicillin and erythromycin) on multiplica-
tlon and persistence of Erysipelothrix insidiosa in experimentally in-
fected turkeys. The number of organisms in the blood and their
presence in the intestinal tract and in the environment of the turkey
was determined at various intervals postexposure.

Vaccination did not prevent the multiplication of E. insidiosa in
some of the vaccinates. The majority of the nonvaccinated and non-
medicated turkeys had a progressive increase of E. insidiosa in the
blood after inoculation with the pathogen. The antibiotic-treated tur-
keys maintained detectable levels of organisms in the blood for a longer
period than did the other groups. A greater number of erythromycin-

treated turkeys retained detectable levels of organisms in the blood
and maintained them for a longer period than did the procaine
penicillin-treated group. Presence of the pathogen in the cloaca did
not correlate with its presence in the circulatory system, nor was there
a correlation between presence of E. insidiosa in the environment and
its presence in the turkey. The presence and concentration of agglu-
tinins in the blood did not appear to have an effect on the presence of
E. insidiosa in either the circulatory system or digestive tract.

(206) Duck Plague (Duck Virus Enteritis)

Louis Leibovitz. V.M.D.
Eastport, Long Island, New York

The previously reported pathologic changes of duck plague are
reviewed. A summary of the gross and histopathologic observations of
the spontaneous and experimental infection is reported.

Gross necropsy ﬁndings are those of speciﬁc, progressively devel—
oped, enanthematous lesions of the digestive mucosa, hemorrhage and
necrosis of visceral organs, serosal hemorrhages, and collections of
free blood within body cavities and hollow organs.

Characteristic microscopic lesions are associated with the circula- l
tory, digestive, and reticuloendothelial systems. Rupture of the walls
of capillaries and venules, with escape of blood elements into the
tissues, are found in early stages of the disease. Later stages evidence
progressive tissue necrosis associated with the vascular damage.

The cycle of speciﬁc cellular response to duck plague virus is as

follows: (1) altered straining properties, (2) cellular swelling, (3) di- :
vision of the cytoplasm into subunits that are discharged through a i
, ruptured cell surface, and (4) the formation of intranuclear inclusion
bodies. This speciﬁc cellular response is most pronounced in reticulo-
endothelial tissue, but is also found Within the epithelial cells of the
digestive mucosa] lesions, pancreas, and in hepatic cells found in
focal necrotic areas of the liver.

Age, species, and sex of the host, as well as virulence of the virus,
inﬂuence the pathologic response.

 

 

(207) Isolation of a Type | Avian Adenovirus (CELO)
Mutant That Was Nonpathogenic tor the Chicken Embryo

Louise T. Miller. M.S.: V. Jasty, B.V.Sc.
Kingston, Rhode Island

, A mutant isolated from plaque—puriﬁed type 1 avian adenovirus
i (CELO) differed from the parent virus in embryo pathogenicity and in
plaque size.
Allantoamnionic ﬂuid containing plaque-puriﬁed type 1 avian
. ‘5 adenovirus was passed through a 100-mm. millipore membrane and used
to inoculate bottles of chick embryo kidney cells (CEK) . After adsorp-
tion, the cells were overlaid with agar, and incubated at 37 C. On
day 6, pinpoint plaques were observed. With additional incubation, the
plaques were seen to vary greatly in size. One large and one small
plaque were harvested, diluted with phosphate-buffered saline, and
used to inoculate additional bottles of CEK cells which were overlaid.
The plaque-harvesting and passage procedure was repeated four times.
The time of appearance and plaque size remained as described above.
The characteristics of the small plaque virus in tissue culture and
in embryonated eggs were essentially the same as those of the original
virus. The virus that produced the large plaques was identiﬁed as a
mutant since it differed markedly from the parent stock in plaque
size and embryo pathogenicity. Antiserum against the mutant effec-
tively neutralized the cellular pathogenicity of the parent virus.

The mutant is being studied to determine whether it differs in other
characteristics from the stock virus. Its oncogenicity is of special inter-
est because the parent virus is known to induce tumors in hamsters
and to transform mammalian cells in culture.

ce 0n the basis of ﬂuorescence microscopy, avian infectious bronchitis
virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) were speciﬁcally and
as diﬁerentially identiﬁed in single and dual infections of primary chicken
li- embryo kidney cells (CEKC). In singly infected CEKC cultures, the size
a and number of foci of viral infected cells was directly related to the
.n viral concentration of the inoculum and the time of viral replication.
3- Evidence of interference of NDV by IBV was observed in dual infections
[9 of CEKC. Replication of NDV occurred equally well in baby hamster
n kidney cells (BHK-21) as in CEKC, but there was no evidence that IBV
infected BHK-21 cells.

(209) A Quantitative Immunotluorescent Test for the
Avian Encephalomyelitis Virus

Athens, Georgia

A ﬂuorescent antibody conjugate was prepared against the avian
encephalomyelitis virus and immunoﬂuorescent staining of infected
cells was used to quantitate the virus. The growth of the virus was
evaluated in several cell culture systems. Using this procedure virus-
neutralization tests were conducted on serums to evaluate the immune
status of chickens against the avian encephalomyelitis virus. This
procedure was more rapid than the virus-neutralization test run in

:mbryonated eggs and can readily be applied under diagnostic situa-
lOIlS.

lilO) Responsibility of Investigators ot lnvestigational
New Animal Drugs Under the Food. Drug and
Cosmetic Act and Regulations

James E. Porter. D.V.M.. and F. George Sperling. V.M.D.
Washington, DC.
This report deals with the actions required and the responsibilities
of the following organizations and people to comply with regulation

130.3 (a) the Investigational New Animal Drugs (INAD): (1) the drug
manufacturer or sponsor; (2) the investigator; (3) the feed manufac-

 

 

 

I89

 

 




turer and the producer; (4) the Food and Drug Administration, Bureau
of Veterinary Medicine; (5) the United States Department of Agricul-
ture, Consumer and Marketing Service.

This report will be divided into 3 parts. The 1st part deals with
the responsibilities of the drug manufacturer and the investigator.
After the drug manufacturer develops a product he submits certain
data to the Food and Drug Administration and requests the establish-
ment of an Investigational New Animal Drug application previously
called a VIND, recently redesignated INAD.

The 2nd part deals with the responsibility of the feed manufac-
turer and the livestock and poultry producer. When new drugs are
developed the drug manufacturer, in order to further investigate to
establish safety and efﬁcacy of the product, contacts the feed manu-
facturer to carry out ﬁeld clinical studies which will assist the drug
manufacturer in eventually obtaining an approved drug application.

The 3rd part deals with the actions and responsibilities required by
law of the Food and Drug Administration and the US. Department
of Agriculture. The Investigational New Animal Drug regulation
section 130.3 (a) is, in effect, an exemption from section 505 (a) of the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The purpose of this regulation is to
permit interstate shipment of a new drug substance without an ap-
proved application. If the drug is intended for use in clinical investiga-
tion, in animals that will be used for human food, data should be
included to show that consumption of edible products will not be
inconsistent with the public health and do not contain drug residues
or their metabolites. An authorization will be required to market the
edible products from these animals.

(2| I) Oncogenic Specificities of Strain MC29
Avian Leukosis Virus

Joseph W. Beard. M.D.
Durham, North Carolina

Much studied avian leukosis viruses isolated in the past 4 decades
are principally of 2 well-deﬁned groups. Most strains, like RPL12,
cause erythroblastosis and other growths, although a smaller number,
as exempliﬁed by BAI strain A, induce myeloblastosis and a varied
associated tumor spectrum. Occurrence of a less intensively investi-
gated third group of genome-speciﬁc leukosis strains is indicated by
the oncogenic activity of strain M029 which closely resembles that of
several other isolates such as Furth’s strain II described nearly 40
years ago. This report describes distinctive aspects of myeloid and
other tissue neoplastic responses to the agent in the host and in
culture.

agar gel precipitin test (AGPT), the ﬂuorescent-antibody (FA) test or
the indirect-hemagglutination test. Birds exposed to MDV may react
differently, some may live without signs, others become paralyzed or
die, and others recover.

To test for the development of antibodies in infected chickens and
the signiﬁcance of these antibodies, birds were exposed to MDV at dif-
ferent ages and bled at weekly intervals after exposure. Antibody
titers of the serums from each bleeding were determined by AGPT or
FA, or both, after the last bleeding thereby testing all the dilutions
of each serum against a common antigen.

Birds that developed antibodies 2 to 4 weeks after exposure and
maintained a titer thereafter survived beyond a 10-week period. Birds
that did not develop demonstrable antibodies or birds that developed
antibodies but in low titer did not survive infection.

When birds were exposed at various ages to MDV, the older birds
developed antibodies earlier than young birds and in higher titers
which suggests that older birds usually survive exposure because of

the capability of developing antibodies rather than because of an
age resistance.

. Flock A chickens had precipitins against Marek’s disease (MD)
Virus and some were viremic, whereas their progeny (ﬂock B) main-
tained in isolation since July, 1968, have been negative by these
cntena. Antibody-negative chicks derived from ﬂock B were more
susceptible (p < 0.01) than antibody-positive chicks from ﬂock A
when challenged at 1 day old. When exposure was delayed until
the antibody titer declined (3 weeks), susceptibility of chicks from
the 2 flocks was not signiﬁcantly different.

Ewdence that maternal antibody could neutralize MD virus was also
cbtamed by using cell culture techniques. Signiﬁcantly more MD-
mfected cells (p < 0.01) were found in kidneys of ﬂock B-derived
Chicks than in those from ﬂock A following exposure to MD virus at
1 day old.

The incidence of precipitating antibody in 15 strains of chickens

was assessed by testing serums from chicks up to 4 days of age.
Pay-old chicks hatched contemporaneously were tested for susceptibil-
lty to MD. In 3 trials chicks of more susceptible strains tended to have
a lower incidence of detectable maternal antibody than those of more
resistant strains but in only 1 trial was this relationship signiﬁcant
(rank correlation coefﬁcient of p < 0.01). Chicks with or without ac-
tively acquired antibody when 6 weeks of age did not differ sig-
niﬁcantly in MD incidence at 8 weeks. ‘

(2|4) Biologic and Morphologic Studies of
Reticuloendotheliosis Virus (Strain T) in Chickens

A. S. Levine. D.V.M.; F. Padgett. D.V.M.;
W. F. Campbell. D.V.M..: A. C. Raitano. D.V.M.
Indianapolis, Indiana

An electron microscopic survey for virus in tissues from chickens
infected with strain T of reticuloendotheliosis virus was undertaken.
Sections of femoral bone marrow, spleen, liver, and cerebellum from
infected chickens were examined. Mature virus was observed singly
or in groups within cytoplasmic vesicles in the spleen. Some virus
particles in the liver resembled those described in murine leukemia
(dried grape appearance). Mature virus was seen scattered through-
out the meshwork of axons and dendrons of the cerebellum and oc-
casionally groups of particles were found within synapses or axons
as seen in cross-section. Virus particles were not observed in the
femoral bone marrow. »

Attempts to concentrate and purify reticuloendotheliosis virus
(strain T) have demonstrated a progressive decrease in titer as the
virus preparation is subjected to centrifugation (2,000 rpm.) . Con-
centration of cells or cellular debris were shown to exhibit the highest
titers observed. Storage of partially puriﬁed virus at —70 C. does
not maintain infectivity, even though cellular debris tended to stabilize
the virus.

(2|5) Use of the Embryonating Egg in Studies on
Marek's Disease

Peter M. Biggs. Ph.D.. M.R.C.V.S.. and B. S. Milnel F.|.M.L.T.
Houghton, H untingdon, England

The inoculation of Marek’s disease virus (MDV)-infected cultured
chick kidney cells (CKC) or freshly prepared buffy coat cells onto
the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) or into the yolk sac of chick
embryos, results in the formation of pocks in the chorioallantoic
membrane.

Inoculation of 11-day-old embryos followed by an incubation
period of 5 days was found to be optimal‘ for the CAM route and inocu-
lation of 4-day-old embryos followed by an incubation period of 12
to 14 days for the yolk sac route.

The CAM route was found to be an accurate technique for assaying
MDV-infected cells which are not immunologically competent. How-
ever, when preparations, such as buffy coat cells, containing immuno-
logically competent cells are used, graft versus host pocks are produced
which are indistinguishable from the pocks induced by MDV-infected
cells. Eggs derived from hens with MDV precipitins were only up to
twofold less sensitive than eggs derived from hens with no MDV
precipitins. An examination of a number of inbred and other lines of
chicken as a source of eggs showed only a twofold difference in sensi-
tivity.

The yolk sac route was neither as sensitive nor as accurate as
the CAM route or a tissue culture technique for the quantitation of
MDV-infected CKC. However, the yolk sac route was found to be useful
for the detection and quantitation of infected whole blood and buffy

coat cells. The presence of antibodies to MDV signiﬁcantly reduced
the sensitivity of the yolk sac technique. However, when eggs derived
from hens without precipitins to MDV were used, the yolk sac technique
was signiﬁcantly more sensitive for the assay of MDV-infected blood and
buffy coat cells than assay in cultured CKC. The yolk sac technique is
simple and therefore useful for the identiﬁcation of infected material
but it should be used with some caution since nonspeciﬁc pocks were
noticed on rare occasions.

(2l6) Study of Plaque Types and Rescue of Virus from
Tissue Cultures Infected with Cal-l Strain of Herpesvirus

T. Mikami. D.V.M.. M.S.. and R. A. Bankowski, D.V.M.. Ph.D.

Davis, California

Two distinct types of plaques were observed on serial passage
of the Cal-1 strain of Marek’s disease herpesvirus (MDHV) in chick
kidney cell (CKC) cultures. The smaller type 1 plaque which is nor-
mally observed on primary isolation of the agent from Marek’s dis-
ease (MD)-infected chickens was replaced by the larger type 2 plaque
by the 14th serial passage. Using the same stock inoculum in CKC
cultures prepared from chickens from the same ﬂock, replacement
oftype 1 occurred in 2 of 5 trials.

Marked differences were observed between the 2 plaque—type
producmg agents (PTPA) regarding rate of growth, cytoplasmic vacuola-
tlon, intranuclear inclusions, recovery of cell-free virus from super—
natant ﬂuids of CKC cultures, and pathogenicity for chickens.

Mediums containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10% dimethyl-
sulfoxide had marked sparing effect on viability of type 1 and type 2
agents following 3 cycles of freezing and thawing as measured by in
vitro and in vivo tests.

Serums of chickens containing precipitin antibodies did not neu-
tralize cell-free virus producing type 2 plaques in CKC cultures. How-
ever neutralizat'on occurred with chicken hyperimmune antitype 2
serum.

At least 2 lines were observed by the gel diffusion test with each

PTPA: One line was conﬂuent to each type and another appeared to be
speCIﬁc for each PTP .

A herpesvirus isolated from turkeys (Hv'r) will protect chickens
against Marek’s disease (MD). The minimum dose of virus necessary

to obtain adequate protection has been determined. The HVT offers
some protection against MD when it is administered to birds between
1 day and 3 weeks old regardless of when they are challenged with
the virulent virus. Preliminary results indicate that the Hv'r is also
effective in limited ﬁeld trials.

(2l9) Immunization Against Marek's Disease

Caswell S. Eidson. Ph.D.. and David P. Anderson. D.V.M.l Ph.D.
Athens, Georgia

Since the ﬁrst reports of an association between a herpes-type
virus and Marek’s disease (MD), considerable evidence has been ac-
cumulated which supports the premise that the herpes-type virus
causes MD. Continuous passage of the virus in cell culture results in
the loss of its oncogenic potential for the chicken. Recently a herpes-
type virus was isolated from turkeys and when injected into chickens,
it was found not be oncogenic.

In order to determine whether the 2 isolates were capable of im-
munizing chickens against MD, chickens were vaccinated at one day
of age with either a high-passage tissue culture propagated MD
herpesvirus (GA isolate) or with a low-passage tissue culture pro-
pagated turkey herpesvirus (WHG isolate). The vaccinated and con-
trol birds were challenged at 3 weeks of age either by injecting the
chickens subcutaneously with 0.2 m1. of GA infective plasma or by
contact exposure. Vaccinated birds were protected up to 30 weeks of
age; whereas the controls experienced 30 to 60% mortality.

It has been necessary to vaccinate each bird since the virus will
not spread from the vaccinated birds to the contact control birds.
Although the turkey herpesvirus will protect chickens from the MD
challenge virus, it differs from the MD herpesvirus in several ways.
First, the MD herpesvirus has been found to be a cell-associated
virus; whereas the turkey herpesvirus can be readily found as a
cell-free virus in the tissue culture mediums. Second, the turkey
herpesvirus does not ﬂuoresce when stained with an MD-ﬂuorescent
antibody conjugate.

(22l) Prolonged Barbitura’re Anesthesia by
Chloramphenicol in Laboratory Animals

H. Richard Adams. D.V.M.
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

After an accidental break in aseptic technique, 450 mg. of chlor-
amphenicol was administered to a lO-kg. dog undergoing experimental
pericardiotomy under pentobarbital anesthesia. The remainder of
the procedure was uneventful and spontaneous respiration occurred
within 10 minutes after closure; however, the dog did not awaken
from the anesthetic until 30 hours following the procedure. The pro-
longed duration of anesthesia observed in this patient prompted an
experimental investigation into chloramphenicol—barbiturate interac-
tion in groups of rodents, cats, dogs, and infrahuman primates.

I94

 




Ipe
ac-
rus

Dn-

With certain oxybarbiturates, chloramphenicol consistently induced
a prolonged duration of anesthesia in all species examined. Thera-
peutic dose levels of chloramphenicol prolonged the mean duration
of anesthesia in dogs, cats, and monkeys (Saimiri sciureus, M acaca
irus, and Macaca mulatta) by 100 to 300% over the respective
control values. In rats and mice, higher doses of chloramphenicol
prolonged the duration of anesthesia by 400 to 2,000% over the
respective control values.

These ﬁndings suggest that chloramphenicol may inhibit the liver
microsomal enzymes concerned with the biotransformation of certain
oxybarbiturates since it is well known that the anesthetic action of
these agents is terminated by hepatic metabolism.

(222) Diseases of Aged Swine

Daniel G. Brown, D.V.M.. and Donald F. Johnson. D.V.M.
Oak Ridge, Tennessee

Thirty-ﬁve swine which served as controls in a longevity study
of an experimental herd were affected predominantly by chronic dis-
eases after 7 years of age. Thirty-four percent succumbed to acute
cardiac and respiratory failure. The remainder were affected with
a multiplicity of chronic diseases: vertebral exostoses and interverte-
bral ankyloses, 46%; tumors, 43%; gastroenteritis, 40%; cystitis, 28%;
urolithiasis, 17%; cholecystitis, 11%; and nephritis, 11%. Five of 6
females which lived longer than 9 years were affected with endo-
metrial hyperplasia.

The usual clinical syndrome, except for those swine which died
of acute cardiac and respiratory failure, was loss in body weight,
debilitation, bacterial infection, and the usual blood changes associated
with infection. The speciﬁc cause of death was often masked by the
multiplicity of chronic pathologic alterations.

New York, New York

Twelve young adult rats which had received injections of testo-
sterone proprionate of the third day of life were examined at necropsy.
Gross lesions were observed in only 3 animals. One showed severe
purulent oophoritis, and there were accumulations of clear ﬂuid
in the ovarian bursae of 2. Routine cultures disclosed Pasteurella,
pneumotropica from the purulent lesion. Nine yielded negative aerobic
and anaerobic cultures. Two contained nonpathogenic organisms.
M ycoplasma species were recovered from all uteri including the one
containing Pasteurella. Microscopic examination of tissues revealed
mild to moderate accumulations of exudate containing mononuclear
and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, even though no gross lesions
could beldetected. Control rats were negative to mycoplasma cultures
and exhibited no such lesions. Signiﬁcance of these abnormalities is
discussed as possible impediments to interpretation of experimental
data.

(225) Infection of a Taiwan Monkey (Macaca cyclopis)

Leeches (Dinobdella ferox) infest the nasal passages of 4 to 6%
of recently captured Taiwan monkeys (M acaca cyclopis). This species
of leech has also been reported in a rhesus monkey 3 months after
importation to a research institute in England. The parasite ingests
blood from the mucous membrane with resultant epistaxis and chronic
inﬂammation. Partial or complete occlusion of the nasopharynx occurs
depending on numbers of parasites in a host. Breathing and eating
are affected and some discomfort to the host occurs. Successful re-
moval of the parasite readily follows the instillation of a ﬁne mist of
insecticide into the nasal passages. Slides of a representative case will
be shown and discussed and the veterinary aspects of this parasite
class summarized.

(226) Nutritional Muscular Dystrophy and Neonatal
Mortalityin a Rabbit Breeding Colony
Daniel H. Ringler‘i. D.V.M.. M.S.. and G. D. Abrams. M.D.
'Ann Arbor, Michigan

Neonatal mortality in a commercial rabbit breeding colony reached
a level of 90% (approximately 1,000 deaths) over a 4-month period,

and breeding does in the colony subsequently became infertile.
Necropsy of affected neonates revealed no gross lesions. Histopatho-
logic ﬁndings were limited to acute degenerative and inﬂammatory
changes in skeletal muscle, suggestive of vitamin E deﬁciency. Analy-
sis of the ration demonstrated low levels of vitamin E. When adult
does maintained in the laboratory were fed this ration, they mani-
fested severe myopathy, widespread calciﬁcation of soft tissues, and
increased susceptibility of their erythrocytes to hemolysis by hydrogen
peroxide. The histologic lesions and susceptibility of erythrocytes to
hemolysis were reversed by the addition of vitamin E to the diet in
the laboratory. When the deﬁcient diet was replaced by another com-
mercial diet in the breeding colony neonatal mortality and infertility
were corrected.

(228) Spontaneous Rabbit Oral Papillomatosis: Case
Report and Experimental Veriﬁcation

Steven H. Weisbroth. M.S.. D.V.M., and Sheldon Scher. B.S.
' Stony Brook, New York

Oral papillomas of the domestic rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus)
were encountered intially as incidental ﬁndings in rabbits from a com-
mercial rabbitry. Since the disease has not appeared in the literature
since the original description in the mid-1930’s a review of the patho-
logic changes and infectious nature of the condition was undertaken.
In addition to lesion description an epizootiologic survey of the rab-

bitry in which the papillomas originated showed the condition to be
limited to rabbits between the ages of 6 and 18 months and further
that no correlates were found with respect to caging proximity, genetic
relatedness, or breed or fur pattern. The infectious nature of the
papilloma was demonstrated by inoculations of lesion material onto
the tongues of normal rabbits and rabbits carrying a variety of infec-
tions and transmissible tumors. Correlates were not found between
the agent of oral papillomatosis and those of S'hope papilloma, Shope
ﬁbroma, or the Brown-Pearce carcinoma.

Following suddengspontaneous death of 3 of 24 guinea pigs received
from a commerciaf‘ vendor, routine necropsy examination revealed
pericarditis in one pig. Subsequent bacterial culture and histopatho-
logic examination deﬁned the disease as subacute pericarditis caused
by Diplococcus pneumonia. There was no pneumonia found.

Laboratory Animal Medicine—Second Session

(230a) Continuing Education in Laboratory Animal
Medicine

A. G. Edward. D.V.M.

Davis, California

Continuing education in laboratory animal medicine has been
formng for the last decade. It has had sporadic and individual
attention.

The stimuli for this effort has been: (a) the need to upgrade
this specialty through self study for the American College of
Laboratory Animal Medicine boards and formal education, applying
past criteria and disciplines via graduate degree programs; (b) the
need of those veterinarians, graduating a decade or more in the
past, to update, making their formal education comparable to that
of today; (c) diversiﬁcation of laboratory animal medicine into new
facets such as gnotobiology, creating individual need to attend work-
shops and to study; and (d) maturing of the specialty and the
individual practitioner in recognizing perspectives not previously

addressed such as management, ﬁnancial, temporal, political, and
social implications.

There is a need for continuity, group concern, and a “feed back”
mechanism that measures the quality of education in laboratory
animal medicine.

(230b) Laboratory Animal Medicine and Vivarial
Science: A Program in Continuing Education

Kenneth F. Burns. D.V.M.. Ph.D.

New Orleans, Louisiana

The postdoctoral fellowship program at Tulane University School
of Medicine is designed to provide for an integrated training program
in both basic sciences and clinical disciplines for veterinarians inter-
ested in pursuing academic careers in laboratory animal medicine.

Academically qualiﬁed veterinarians receive course work along
interdisciplinary lines through the cooperation of other departments
of the school of medicine such as the pathology, pharmacology, and
surgery departments. Trainees concurrently serve a clinical residency
in laboratory animal medicine under the direction of board-certiﬁed
veterinarians in this specialty. This residency consists of a rotating
clinical responsibility in the experimental animal colonies, supervised
seminars, and formal lectures in laboratory animal medicine and
vivarial science. The graduate degree earned is either the Master of
Medical Science in Vivarial Science (M.M.S.), the Master of Public
Health (M.P.H.), or the Doctor of Philosophy in Pharmacology-
Toxicology (Ph.D.), for qualiﬁed candidates.

(23la) Education and Postdoctoral Training in Laboratory
Animal Medicine

Alvin F. Moreland. M.S.. D.V.M.

Gainesville, Florida

The University of Florida College of Medicine began a program of
postdoctoral training in July, 1965. Candidates are appointed as
fellows in laboratory animal-comparative medicine and receive stipend
support from National Institutes of Health Grant RR05003. The
program provides training for a maximum enrollment of 3 students.
Students must be accepted by the graduate school. This program
provides a course of postdoctoral training for veterinarians in the ﬁeld
of laboratory animal-comparative medicine which assures their profes-
sional or clinical competence and in addition provides them with an
academic background of sufﬁcient depth to allow them to advance and
disseminate knowledge in this ﬁeld. The program may extend a vari-
able length of time determined by qualiﬁcations of trainees and re-
quirements for completion of the Master’s degree and associated clini-
cal training. All trainees receive instruction in (1) laboratory animal
disease control, diagnosis, treatment and experimental induction, sur-
gery, and postsurgical care; (2) laboratory animal biology, husbandry,
and technology; (3) maintenance of animal breeding colonies; (4)
design of animal facilities and equipment; and (5) administrative pro-

quired to conduct a medical research project of sufﬁcient depth to
meet the research requirements for a graduate degree and all receive
appropriate didactic instruction in a basic science discipline as required
for the Master’s degree.

(23lb) Training Methods Used in Laboratory Animal
Medicine Training Programs

Ronald E. Flattl D.V.M.. Ph.D.. and Louis R. Nelson. D.V.M.

Columbia, Missouri

The methods used in training veterinarians in the speciality of
laboratory animal medicine vary considerably. Formal course work,
seminars, and residency training are the methods most often: used.
Formal course work may be offered in basic sciences or speciﬁc courses
In laboratory animal medicine may be required. Multiple courses in
laboratory animal medicine usually require that more than one profes—
s10nal person be actively involved in the training program. Research
training and an advanced degree are important parts of some programs.

The training program at the University of Missouri has 7 actively
participating professional people (6 of which are A.C.L.A.M. dip-
lomates). Seven courses in laboratory animal medicine are required
1n addition to statistics and a regular seminar. Elective courses are
also available in many areas. ~

Residency training is emphasized by utilizing approximately one-
half the total training time divided between the Laboratory Animal
Diagnostic Laboratory, the Department of Laboratory Animal Medi-
cine at the University Medical Center, and the Sinclair Comparative
Medicine Research Farm.

Training in research is accompliShed by requiring a thesis as part
of the requirement for a master’s degree in laboratory animal medicine
which is awarded upon successful completion of the program. '

(23lc) Veterans Administration Program of
Continuing Education
.Fred Buddingb. D.V.M.. PhD.

Hines, Illinois

The Veterans Administration Program of graduate education in
laboratory animal medicine probably differs from other programs
in that it is more speciﬁc goal oriented than other programs. The
program was instituted and implemented to develop individuals
trained to. act as chiefs in charge of the animal research facilities
and the complementary training programs developed within the V.A.
Since V.A. animal research facilities are mainly of small size, the
amount of time needed to direct such a facility, once it is properly
developed, is limited. This necessitates training an individual who is
interested in his own research and the program therefore stresses
training in depth in one of the disciplines. A 2-year residency pro-
gram is blended into the quest for an advanced degree. This degree
may be obtained from one of several cooperating universities.

(23ld) Graduate Education in Laboratory Animal
Medicine at the University of Missouri

Charles C. Middleton. D.V.M.l M.S.

Columbia, Missouri

At the University of Missouri, a degree in Laboratory Animal
Medicine is granted through an area master’s degree program. This
means that graduate degrees are granted in areas where a department
does not exist; the faculty of the area elects a chairman and a director
of graduate studies.

Graduate school approval was obtained in 1967, and the ﬁrst
students started the program that fall. An NIH training grant from
the resources branch was funded in 1968, with 3 students supported
by this grant. Three other students in the program are supported
by individual NIH Postdoctoral Fellowships or other funds.

Most students will take 3 years to complete the program which
includes residency training, graduate course work, and a master’s
thesis. An alternate program is in effect, and 2 students are presently
enrolled. In this program, the student spends the ﬁrst 2 years in
residency training and takes the laboratory animal medicine courses.
They bypass the master’s degree and pursue a Ph.D. in a basic
science, usually pathology.

The faculty members in laboratory animal medicine are appointed
in an academic department in the Veterinary School and hold joint
appointments in the Laboratory Animal Medicine Area Program. The
departments represented include pathology, microbiology, medicine and
surgery, physiology, biochemistry, and anatomy.

(23le) Postdoctoral Graduate Education in Laboratory
Animal Medicine at Ohio State University

Steven P. Pakes. D.V.M.. M.S.
Columbus, Ohio

The postdoctoral graduate education program in laboratory animal
medicine at Ohio State University was initiated in 1961 in the College
of Veterinary Medicine. It is a 2-year program leading to a Master
of Science degree in Veterinary Medicine. The program has great
ﬂexibility being intimately associated with the College of Medicine
and is designed to meet the needs and disciplinary interests of the
individual student. The curriculum is devised to impart the broad
body of knowledge existing in laboratory animal medicine, and to
achieve productive scholarship and knowledge in a discipline in rela-
tion to the specialty.

gram is research oriented and promotes specialization in a major area,
as well as breadth of scholarship through the requirement of a minor
in a related ﬁeld.

Graduate work in laboratory animal medicine is conceived of as
basic training in methodology and the development of scholarship
within the specialty. This in-depth training prepares the student to
assume a position of informed and responsible authority in his ﬁeld
and to contribute creatively to it.

Laboratory Animal Medicine—Third Session

(232) Laboratory Animal Resources: The Role of the
National Institutes of Health

Charles McPherson. D.V.M.
Bethesda, Maryland

.The Animal Resource Program of the National Institutes of Health
as31sts institutions in developing and improving animal resources for
biomedical research and education. The importance of animal re-
sources is emphasized by the fact that well over half of all NIH-
supported research projects make use of animals. Survey data are pre-
sented indicating the current status of animal resource facilities, per-
sonnel, administration, ﬁnancing, and animal use patterns. Programs
of support for training, research, animal model development, diagnos-
tlc laboratories, information projects, and special animal resource
colonies are described. Probable future directions of animal resource
programs and of involvement of veterinarians in laboratory animal
medicine and comparative medicine are discussed.

(233) Attitudes for Laboratory Animal Care in the l970's

Edward C. Melby. Jr.. D.V.M.
Baltimore, Maryland

The veterinary profession is a relative newcomer to what may be
classiﬁed as laboratory animal medicine, science, and technology, active
involvement has occurred only since the late 1940’s. Although small
In terms of total percentage of effort by the profession, it is a rapidly
growing ﬁeld with unparalleled opportunities for scientiﬁc and profes-
sional achievement.

It is a rapidly changing ﬁeld. Newer concepts and techniques are
providing research animals of a quality never before available, and
automated equipment is decreasing the need for and reliance on ill-
trained or poorly motivated animal care attendants. Acceptance of
centralized animal facilities and their administration has greatly

expanded the role and opportunities for veterinarians contributing to
biomedical research and education. A summary of our past achieve-
ments and expectations for the coming decade in this ﬁeld will be
presented together with speciﬁc recommendations for veterinarians
seeking careers in this specialty.

(234) Trends in Laboratory Animal Medicine

Roger D. Estep. D.V.M.
Washington, DC.

The 1960’s marked a period of unparalleled growth in the volume
of knowledge and in the techniques and resource developments essen-
tial in laboratory animal medicine. These realities were favored by the
existence of a “climate of acceptance,” unmet needs, and ever-expand-
ing demands for veterinary contributions to laboratory animals in the
areas of service, education, and research.

As this decade ends, its impact is left upon the speciality of labora-
tory animal medicine. Its characterization reﬂects the interfacing of
current capabilities with projected needs, early deﬁnitions of goals
and objectives, systematic development, and adaptation to unforeseen
changes. These events will fashion the trends of the 1970’s.

This paper will attempt to elucidate speciﬁc patterns in laboratory
animal medicine during the past decade.

(235) Implementation of Federal Laboratory Animal
Legislation

Ernest E. Saulmon. D.V.M.
H yattsville, Maryland

In 1966, Congress passed the ﬁrst federal legislation which con-
trolled the procurement, transportation, holding, and use of animals
intended for purposes of research. This law required the Department
of Agriculture to promulgate regulations and minimal standards to
insure minimum care for these animals. The department asked for
and received aid and assistance from many sources, both in the re-
search ﬁeld and from humane organizations, in establishing these
standards. These standards are minimal as opposed to optimal stan-
dards used by voluntary plans.

Dealers, as deﬁned in that legislation, have been licensed and re-
search facilities have been registered with a marked improvement
noticed in the care and handling of these animals. It has been
necessary to take legal sanctions against some organizations, but the
entire industry has cooperated to attain the objectives of the act.

Problems remaining to be solved include restriction of the act to
6 species of animals, deﬁnition of dogs and cats as “live animals,” and
abuses found related to the transportation, care, and handling of
animals intended for pets or exhibition.

Euthanasia of large groups of animals will be discussed.

New high in professionalism...and protection

Now, from Fort Dodge’s vast experience in
biologicals comes new efﬁcacy and security
in a canine distemper-hepatitis vaccine:
Can-O-Vax, with Tubex injection system.

New tissue culture Can-O-Vax passes one of
the most stringent potency tests ever de-
vised. Further, each serial will be subjected
to similar testing—among the most strin-
gent in use today—before being marketed.

Passage of the hepatitis fraction through
bovine kidney cells, exclusive with Fort
Dodge, has resulted in signiﬁcant reduction
of transitory corneal Opacities ordinarily as-
sociated with modiﬁed live virus hepatitis
vaccines.

The highly professional Tubex injection
system assures accuracy, sterility, security
—with time-saving convenience. It enhances
your image of clinical proﬁciency.

Remember to look for the
Corvel Extra / Ordinary beneﬁts

At ﬁrst glance, pharmaceuticals and biologicals in the Corvel
Extra/ Ordinary Line might seem similar to competitive

products. But when you look closer, you ﬁnd advantages not
duplicated elsewhere. There are no “ordinary” products here!

Often the most obvious difference is a proprietary one, such as
found in the Tylocine® products. Or it might be a difference
in your cost, a quality difference, or support for the veterinary
profession through Client Education literature or the Corvel
Practice and Professional Aids program.

Be sure you know all the products good enough to be
in the Corvel Extra / Ordinary Line—and never settle

for less than the Extra/ Ordinary advantages. CORveL

e As easy for you
to dlgest as they are
for your dogs.

As a veterinarian, you probably know how good our soft-moist dog foods
are for your dogs . . . that they’re full feeding, highly palatable, and easy to digest.
But, do you know how easy they are for you? First, there's the way
Gaines soft-moist foods are highly digestible for your wallet. If you're a
member of thelGaines Veterinarians’ Feeder Plan, a professional pack
of soft-moist is only $6.78. That’s for 72 6-02. packets. Which is the
nutritional equivalent of 72 l-lb. cans of a leading full-feeding canned food.
And that costs you $10.01 and up. (Mostly up!) ‘ .

Then there’s the way they’re easy to feed. Easy-to-open and
easy-to—throw-away cellophane packets. And, of course, cellophane weighs
a lot less than cans, which makes it a lot easier to handle. And they’re
even easier to clean up after. (In general, soft-moist products form a noticeably
better stool than canned.)

And we think all of that makes Gaines soft-moist products a
Pretty easy food to take. For your dogs and you.

Enclosed is the registration analysis for the AVMA'S 106th Annual Meeting
held in Minneapolis, July 13~l7, 1969.

We are happy to report that we had the highest number of exhibitors in
AVMA history at our Minneapolis meeting. Registration was up from last
year, and conventioner and exhibitor alike are proclaiming the meeting to
be one of our most successful.

Our appreciation and thanks go to all who helped make this meeting the
success it was.

You may want to mark your calendar to show that the 107th AVMA Annual
Meeting will be held during the dates of June 22-26, 1970 in Las Vegas,

JOURNAL of the AVMA or the AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH are
urged to use these publications to reach your best prospects. Both
journals enjoy the prestige of a specialized audience~—the next best thing
to personal contact.

Dear Miss Stevens:

Enclosed is your contract and invoice for exhibit space at the 107th
Annual Meeting of the AVMA to be held in Las Vegas, Nevada, June 23-26,
1970. Payment in full must be made not later than April 15, 1970.

Exhibit space has been assigned on a basis of one (1) point for each
$500.00 of advertising in AVMA publications in 1969, and five (5) points
for each year of participation in an AVMA exhibit. Obviously, under this
system, not all companies will receive the specific space requested. In
such instances, every effort is made to assign space of the same
dimensions in another location.

Complete information about booth furniture, electricity, labor and
drayage will be mailed to you by our official contractor, Manncraft
Exhibitor Service of Kansas City, Missouri. We urge you, in the mean—
time, to review the rules and regulations contained in the exhibit
prospectus and to also familiarize your representatives with this infor~
mation. Additional c0pies of the prospectus are available on request.

Thank you for participating in our 107th Annual Meeting.
