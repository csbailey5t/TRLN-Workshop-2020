A HOOPOE OVER MAJORCA

~ On the Island of Majorca

In the woods round Castle Belver

Rocky, stony is the ground.

And yet this same unyielding earth

Has given birth to each tall pine.

A million firs and olives intertwine

Dense as a forest in a tangledom of dusky green.

They say the hoopoe ﬂies this way,

As yet he has not come my way;

But ’tis not strange he hides on high,
That gay elusive crested bird

Whose gladsome note is oft times heard
By native child or donkey boy.

Seated am I on the stony ground
Silent as the walls of the ageaold ruin,
Quiet as the dead that lay therein.
The wintry sky is growing red

For twilight is near and I must away
And cease my watch till another day.

When suddenly over my head
The evening sky turns a deeper red,
For a hoopoe ﬂies with wings outspread

THE ANIMAL WORLD

 

129

His wonderful piebald crested head
Is like a halo against the sky,
His plumage red as a prunus tree.

He is radiant, and rich, and bold and free,
He rides on the air like Pegasus winged,
King and Emperor, embodiment live
Of a carefree world that is all but lost
And his lovely ‘Hoopoe’ on the wind is tossed
As he ﬂies to the open sea.

YOUNG ANIMALS

Infancy in Animals, by Maurice Burton, DSc
(Hutchinson’s Nature Library, 185.), with draw—
ings by Jane Burton, is a study full of fascination.
It reveals at once how much is known and how
much is still to be known about the ways of ani’
mals. Every page is an argument for the kind
treatment and preservation of animal life.

If we were to criticize the book it would be on
the grounds that much of the study of the ways of
animals and their young was done on captive
creatures. Wild animals were never meant for
captivity either in zoos or as pets.

The magistrates made an order for the imple’

ments to be either destroyed or placed at the

disposal of the RSPCA.

Everything directly connected with cockﬁght—
ing was handed to the RSPCA. The 62 live birds
were humanely destroyed and were handed to the
local branch of Dr Barnardo’s Home, Sealand
House Old Folks’ Home, Chester, and the Chila
dren’s Orphanage, Chester. '

Costs to a total of £540 were awarded against
the defendants, whose fines totalled £615.

Inspectors

RSPCA Inspectors in the case were: Senior
Inspector Lanning, and Inspectors Burr, A. W.
Cole, W. Jones, Abrahams, Budd, Thelwell,
Scott and McCready. (Case No. B1621.)

Historical Background

In between the wars, the RSPCA took ﬁve suc—
cessful prosecutions for cockﬁghting, the last one
being in 1933.

 

 

 

It was quite a common thing for cockﬁghts to
take place at Newmarket and for the birds to be
sent to Folkestone and thence to Calais, where
further cockﬁghts took place. Sometimes the
promoters sent the RSPCA postcards to say that
they were , sending the birds to Calais for the
purposes of a cockﬁght.

Under the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, a
conviction can only be made if a person is either
attending a cockfight or actually promoting it. In
other words, the delinquents have to be caught
‘redvhanded’. It has frequently happened in the
past that RSPCA inspectors have discovered that
cockﬁghts have taken place but because they
were not able to be present at the precise moment
when ﬁghting was taking place no action could be
taken. The Society therefore promoted a Bill—
eventually passed into law as the Cockfighting
Act, 1952—to prohibit a person having in his or
her possession any appliances used in connection
with cockﬁghting: these would include the steel
spurs, the metal ‘funnel’ for weighing the birds,
portable cock pits, and anything of that kind.

 

Spurs, scissors (blood-stained), tags found
on spurs and indicating counties, pencil,
safety pin, chalk, tag for ringing (identi-
ﬁcation of birds), foot-rule, iodine tube,
wood ball presumed for spur tips, box
with spares, ointments‘, list showing allo-
cation of spurs to diﬁerent types of
birds, sponge in waterproof bag

Reprinted from MEN ONLY with acknowledgments; the version printed in MEN ONLY was slightly

Do Parrots Think?

By Angus I. Macnaghten

shorter.

 

 

In this article, Major Macnaghten, Council Member, gives his personal Views. The RSPCA
is, of course, opposed to the caging of wild birds, particularly when they are birds accustomed
to warmer climates. The Author wishes to explain that his personal experiences are conﬁned
to birds rescued from bad homes or acquired as companions for other parrots.

 

 

The Virtual disappearance of parrots as household
pets, due to the fear of psittacosis from newly
imported birds, and their replacement by their
smaller kinsman, the budgerigar, is bringing to
an end the ﬂow of family anecdotes concerning
their conversational wit and intelligence. Now it
is the turn of the ‘budgie’ whose imitative facul—
ties are admittedly prodigious, but, at the risk of
contradiction, I consider that the parrot has an
overwhelming lead in the apparent ability to
think for itself.

Not all parrots are talkers, as I know to my
cost. The Grey Parrot from West Africa (Psittacus
erithacus), the predominantly green Amazon
Parrot (Chrysotis) and the Greater Sulphur Crested
Cockatoo from Australia (Psittacus galeritus)
share the honours for conversational ability, and
the majority of the parrot stories that have been
handed down derive from one or other of these
three species.

The imitative and retentive powers of parrots is
undoubted, and there is no reason to disbelieve
such tales as that of the ancient African Grey
which was bought by a Cardinal for one hundred
golden crowns because it could say the Apostles’
Creed. But how much further do their preten’
sions go? Certainly they have an excellent, if
malicious, sense of humour: a typical example was
that of a parrot at Hampton Court in the time of
the Tudors which used to infuriate the watermen
across the river by calling for a Wherry. On the
arrival of the unsuspecting boatman it would say,
mockingly: ‘Give him a groat! Give him a groat!’
No doubt someone had taught the bird this trick
which it recognized as an unfailing source of
amusement. Many people who have kept a parrot
and a dog in the same house will know of the
parrot’s delight in whistling for the dog and gloata
ing over its consequent bewilderment on failing
to find its master.

Parrots certainly enjoy using bad language.
W. T. Greene in The Grey Parrot mentioned a
bird which took great pleasure from indulging in
strong language. This would be followed by loud
laughter and then: ‘Naughty Polly, you mustn’t
swear.’ But it seems that this particular type of

vocabulary must be acquired young, and I do not
know of parrots learning to swear in middle or
old age. '

A more pleasing, if pathetic, characteristic is
the immense affection in which parrots often
hold their owners, and it is heartbreaking to see
their sorrow and bewilderment when sold on the
death of a welleloved master or mistress. Some
pine away and die, a merciful fate, as was the case
of the little parrot which belonged to the Duchess
of Richmond, ‘La Belle Stuart’, and which for
over two hundred years has remained , united
with her mistress’s wax efﬁgy in Westminster
Abbey. Greene in Parrots in Captivity gave an
instance of this affection in an account of a
peculiarly intelligent Grey Parrot. This bird,
when acquired by ‘a lady of high rank’ could only
speak Dutch, but rapidly picked up French and
German words as well. He spoke single words
and sentences in the Dutch language, and also
introduced Dutch words ‘with judgment’ between
German ones, when he did not know, or had for—
gotten, the German equivalent. He asked ques
tions and returned answers, made requests and
returned thanks, and used words correctly in
relation to time, place and persons. The parrot
was devoted to his mistress, and would say:
‘Well, what is the lady doing there?’ When she
died, .the bird nearly died of grief, and used to
reaawaken the grief of the mourners by asking
them: ‘But where is the lady now?’

This remarkable bird really seemed to have the
power of thought as well as a sense of humour:
a stout Major whom he knew well once attempted
to teach him a trick. ‘Jump on the stick, Polly,
on the stick’, he commanded. The bird was
obviously annoyed and did nothing until sud;
denly he burst out laughing loudly, and said:
‘Major, jump on the stick, Major!’

One of the charms of speaking parrots in the
home is their apparently uncanny knack of join—
ing in conversation or in a family joke or habit.
I shall never forget our old ‘Cockie’, a centenv
arian at least, rocking with silent laughter, if he
saw that we were amused, nor for that matter
the way in which his companion, ‘Hettie’, would

The RSPCA assistants preparing food for air

giving a routine examination to an iguana show

Air Hostel for animals at London airport.

No effort is spared to comfort birds as well as
animals on their journey. Fruit—suckers, shamas
and minivets, birds from India, are receiving
nectar from the assistant manager.

The other pictures show the wide variety of
animal passengers. Last year alone 471,790
living creatures passed through the hostel.

The RSPCA makes no secret of its opinion
that most of these animal and bird passengers
should not be travelling at all. The place for
wild animals and birds is in their native
haunts. ‘

THIRTY-SIX PARTICIPATED IN COCKFIGHTING

When a force of twenty police officers and
RSPCA inspectors went to a Cheshire farm on
the afternoon of Sunday, June 10, they found a
cockpit spattered with blood, fourteen dead
cockerels and 62 live birds in containers of various
kinds. Chairs and benches were set around the
cockpit, which was in the upper storey of a grana
ary building, and people ‘scurried in all direc—
tions’ when the police were seen. This was alleged
at a Magistrates’ Court at Chester Castle, when
36(113eople appeared on charges arising out of the
rai .

After an adjournment on the second day of the
hearing, the 36 people were ﬁned sums ranging
from £10 to £80, and each was ordered to pay £15
costs; some of the summonses against four of
them were dismissed. The Chairman of the
Bench said that the offences were ‘deliberately
planned and carried out without any regard for
the law, to satisfy your own warped sense of
amusement’.

The 62 birds alleged to have been found at the
farm were brought to the court precincts in cages
in an RSPCA bus. Their crowing; could be heard
from time to time as the evidence proceeded. The
dead birds were kept packed in dry ice in a basket
in the courtroom. The alleged cockpit——a square
made with planks measuring 11 ft. square and
16 in. high—with a sponge rubber mat as its
ﬂoor, was erected in the castle courtyard for the
magistrates to inspect. The defendants all pleaded
not guilty.

‘Barbarous’

Counsel prosecuting for the RSPCA and the
Chief Constable of Cheshire said the charges
were brought under the Protection of Animals
Act, 1911, and the Cockﬁghting Act, 1952. They
arose out of the Visit by ofﬁcers of the Society
and the police to the farm owned by one of the
defendants.

The 36 people who arrived in cars came from
far and near, Counsel said; most - of them from
Cheshire and Lancashire, others from Dorset,
Westmorland, Staffordshire and Berkshire. He
continued: ‘They were people of good standing
collected on this Sunday morning obviously pur»
suant to a wellaorganized plan to hold a cock,
fighting main, bringing birds there to participate
1n the battle, and to divert themselves in this
rather barbarous fashion by watching the ﬁght.’

Birds specially bred

Describing cockﬁghting procedure, Counsel
said it had been established over the years alr
though it had been prohibited by law for over a
century. The gamecocks were specially bred and

reared for their ﬁghting prowess, and were prev
pared for battle with a sharp metal spur attached
to a leg. Their combs and wattles and wing
feathers are trimmed to make them less of a tar—
get for their opponents. They were matched
against cocks of even weight, and fought to the
death in a cockpit. The loser certainly died, and it
was not‘unusual for the victor to die too. The
spurs inﬂicted sharp deep wounds; death might be .
quick, but sometimes the ﬁght might go on until
one bird was prostrate with exhaustion and a
sitting target.

‘It appeared’, he said, ‘that the cockﬁghting
at the farm began shortly after everyone had
assembled at 9 a.m., on Sunday, June 10, and con»
tinued throughout the morning. The police and
RSPCA inspectors moved into the premises at
2.30 pm. Some unidentiﬁed person saw them,
gave the alarm, and retreated into a granary. The
door was closed and held shut against the police.
When the police got in they found people scurry;
ing about in all directions, a number of them com~
ing from a room upstairs which was the scene of
the cockﬁghting.’

Police Dog used

Some of them made more or less energetic
efforts to get away, and a police dog had to be
used against two who managed to get into a ﬁeld.
Others endeavoured to hide among farm imple—
ments and hay. A search of the premises disclosed
spurs and other cockﬁghting apparatus. The
wooden cockpit seemed to have been dismantled
in a hurry, and blood and feathers were spattered
about. Some of the 62 live birds found in boxes
in the granary had evidently been in battle that
day. One was still dazed and bleeding from a
wound. The fourteen dead birds which were
found showed injuries which could have been
caused by sharp spurs, and one of them still had a
spur attached to its leg.

Some of the live birds had obviously been
weighed. in preparation for battle, for they had
weight labels attached to their legs. Natural spurs
which had been cut from the birds were also
found. The police had not been able to discover
who owned many of the birds: ‘There seems to
have been some reluctance about claiming them’,
said Counsel. They did not know either to whom
the cockpit belonged.

Among the defendants were two women. One
was found hidden under some hay and farm imr
plements. Some of the bird containers had her
name on. She admitted that a bloodstained overall
was hers, but said that the blood might have
come from a scratch on her hand. ‘The prosecu’
tion say that she had come from Stoke with a

Indian fruit-suckers, shamas and minivets receive nectar

Animals are carried from one country to
another for such purposes as being caged in zoos,
being made to perform unnatural antics for the
entertainment of a paying public or for use in
painful experiments.

All such uses of wild creatures are wrong says
the RSPCA.

Unfortunately, however, the Law permits such
exploitation of animals and birds.

For this reason the RSPCA maintains its
Good Samaritan service at London airport
giving the animals comfort, food, rest,
exercise and where necessary veterinary treat—
ment. Whilst providing this service the
RSPCA continues vigorously its agitation to
stop the exploitation of animals and birds and
so bring‘nearer the time when they are left to
live the lives for which nature intended
them. '

Their journey is not really necessary!

rush to the front window, whenever she heard a
military band on the wireless, from familiarity
with the excitement of seeing the Guards passin
our house every day at Windsor. ‘
Parrots generally have no trouble in distinguish;
ing dogs from cats, though ‘Hettie’ was once
baffled at the sight of a toy pomeranian. ‘Pussy?’
she asked in a puzzled tone of voice. Explanations
would have been difﬁcult, so we agreed with her
verdict. ‘Hettie’ then ‘miaued’, quite contentedly.
What then do all these engaging habits amount
to? Dr Karl Russ, the great nineteenth century
authority, wrote: ‘that parrots are possessed of
wit and irony is incredible, but it is incontestable
that they attach meanings to certain words.’
Greene, however, in Parrots in Captivity was more
cautious: a parrot belonging to a doctor learned
‘to say, whenever-a patient knocked: ‘Open the
door, and call the doctor.’ But occasionally it
reversed this order and would shout out: ‘Open
the doctor, and call the door’, apparently quite
unconscious of its mistake, and showing, claimed

 

 

Greene, that ‘although it might attach, and doubt.
less did, a certain meaning to the sentence, the
several words of which it was composed con—
veyed no ideas to its mind’. Poor Polly!

‘In the face of anecdotes’ wrote Greene, ‘it
would really appear as if these birds were gifted
with a certain modicum of human intelligence,
but a little‘reﬂection and careful observation will
show that while the Parrot is certainly capable of
attaching ideas to certain sounds, it is incapable
of generalization; and that many of its most
apposite answers and remarks are no more than
mere coincidences.’ This was Greene’s considered
opinion, and is probably a just one, but I like to
think that occasionally there are, and have been,
parrots possessed of some sixth sense, putting
their powers outside the range of scientiﬁc
deﬁnition.

MARKET REFURMS

RSPCA Inspectors in various parts of the country
have reported improvements both great and small.

At Nelson Cattle Market, Merthyr Tydﬁl, the
calves are now under cover and a new scale has
been installed for weighing sheep,'replacing the
old custom of weighing the sheep on the cattle
scale, which entailed discomfort and alarm for
the smaller animals.

At Dolgelly, the Inspector has succeeded in
obtaining straw bedding for the calves, cover for
the pigs and special pens to accommodate the
boars. '

At Maidstone Cattle Market new loading ramps
have been installed for the use of pigs; whilst at
Sudbury Market a portable ramp has been pro
vided to ease conditibns for both pigs and sheep.

From Tynedale Market, Northumberland,
comes the following excellent news, reported by
Inspector Cowan: ‘The extension to the cattle
market has now been completed, at a cost of
£6,000 and the following work has now been car—
ried out: Thirty new cattle pens have been built;
they are of steel rail construction and have con—
crete ﬂoors with proper draining channels. Four
new cattle loading ramps have been built and so
constructed that all cattle are loaded on the level:
no cattle have to walk up an incline. An area has
been covered in, so that all cattle are under
cover as soon as they leave the lorries. New slid—
ing doors have been ﬁtted, so as to provide better
ventilation during hot weather. Extra glass panels
have been ﬁtted to the roof to give better lighting.

All animals are provided with straw and hay, free
of charge. Calf muzzles are not allowed. No cattle
are allowed to stay overnight in market and it is
always cleared in good time. . . .’

A new livestock. market is being built at
Shrewsbury and one block—for attested dairy
cattle—is already in use. Inspector Watt, writing
of the newly opened section, states: ‘This market
is a very great improvement and there is every
comfort for the stock. Calves are conveyed to the
pens by special hand carts, milking machines are
available and no one, apart from the owner or a
drover, is allowed in the sale ring. I cannot speak
too highly of the vast improvements made. The
remainder of the market will not be completed
for some time, but there can be no doubt that it
will be completed and at long last ShreWSburV
Market, instead of being an eyesore, will be a

place where animals will enjoy plenty of com!
ort. . . .’

number of birds and that she was handling them
herself.’

The first prosecution witnesses were nine
RSPCA inspectors who said they kept watch on
the farm from 2.45 am. until the police arrived.
One of them described how at about 12.30 pm.
there was ‘a great noise of cocks crowing and
people shouting.’

 

‘
ﬂ

‘Highly Respectable’

A Chief Inspector led the eleven police
witnesses. Crossrexamined, he agreed that there
was no sign of betting at the farm, and that the
defendants were ‘highly respectable’ people.

Major Hancock, chief veterinary officer of
the RSPCA, said he had examined the carcasses
of fifteen cocks. They bore signs of injury
to the head, neck, and chest. One bird had the
tattered remains of an eye hanging out of the
socket. He thought the birds suffered before they
died.

Defence Counsel: Would you agree that game
cocks are peculiarly insensible to pain?—They
may be berserk when they are fighting and in’
different to the wounds they receive, but as soon
as the heat of the battle is over they must experiv
ence pain.

At the close of the evidence for the prosecution .

the case was adjourned till next day.

‘Warped sense of amusement’

Next day Counsel representing 33 of the de—
fendants said: ‘I am not seeking to contest the
illegality of holding a cockfight, but one wonders
why cockfighting comes to be illegal when there is
no law against fOthunting, stagvhunting, or
coursing where odds are hopelessly uneven. It is
not true that this was a fight to the death when a
bird became exhausted and a sitting target. My
instructions are that if a bird was badly wounded
it was immediately dispatched by what the veter’
inary witness said yesterday was the recognized
method—wringing its neck.’

‘Enough legal sport’

The Chairman of the Bench told the defen—
dants: ‘One might have expected that you, in VOUI‘
positions, might have set an example to people in
less fortunate circumstances. One defendant said
to the police inspector, ‘ ‘I insist that no betting has
taken place.” I find that very difﬁcult to believe,
but if it is true it means that you people assembled
at the farm on that day simply for the pleasure of
watching birds tear themselves to pieces. In these
days I should have thought that there was quite
sufﬁcient legalized sport to suit all tastes without
indulging in an outdated and illegal form '0f
amusement, one that has for a very long time
been declared cruel by law.

‘It may be that you defendants think you are
upholding a ﬁne old English custom, to regard
yourselves as upholders of ancient rights an
customs, but after seeing these photographs and
listening to what happened on that Sunday after!
noon I fail to see how the events of that day can
be described as anything but cruel.’
