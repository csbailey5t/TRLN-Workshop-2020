Views of Men and Women
of Note on Vivisection.

 

QUEEN VICTORIA.

A QUEEN’S EXCITEMENT.

Principal Tulloch, in a letter dated 1874,
reports the following :——“ The Queen then
talked very warmly of Vivisection, about which
she is greatly excited. It made her wild, she
said, to think of the cruelties practised toward
poor animals, and she ridiculed the idea of
comparing it to sport.”

DR. WESTCOTT
(BISHOP OF DURHAM).

UNLIKE GOD.

“ If He who made us made all other creatures
also, and if they ﬁnd a place in His providential
plan, if His tender mercies reach to them———-and
this we Christians most certainly believe—then
I ﬁnd it absolutely inconceivable that He should
have so arranged the avenues of knowledge~
that we can attain to truths, which it is His will
that we should master, only through the
umstterable agonies of beings which trust in us.”

——Sermon in Westminster Abbey, August 18th, 1889.

PROFESSOR FREEMAN.
CANNOT DRAW THE LINE.

“ Knowledge is a great object, but it is not
the highest of objects. It is surely easy to
conceive cases in which it is right to abstain
from acquiring knowledge. The practical con-
clusion that I come to is, that if the distinction
can be drawn in practice between what I hold to
be lawful and unlawful Vivisection, I would
allow one and forbid the other. But I see the
very great difficulty in drawing the line between
the two; and, if it cannot be drawn in practice,
especially as it seems so very doubtful whether
Vivisection has lessened human suffering or not,
I can only go in for a complete forbidding of
the practice.”

—-Letter to the " Times,” fameary 16th, 1885.

REV. PHILIP H. WICKSTEED,
M.A., LITTD.

SHALL WE ALLOW IT?

“Men pursue knowledge in as complete
disregard of the animal suffering their
researches involve as we will allow.”

~Sermon on “ Our Relations to Animals,” ]une 26th., 1892.

BISHOP BARRY, D.D., D.C.L.

(Canon of Windsor, late Primate of Australia).

A CHRISTIAN IMPOSSIBILITYQ

“ To hold that the increase of physical com-
fort, the removal of physical pain, the prolonga-
tion of physical life, are the supreme objects
for the sake of which we may demoralise our
higher humanity, is simply a worship of the
ﬂesh, unworthy of a true man, impossible to a
true Christian.”

—Paper read at the Church Congress at Folkestone, 1892.

“ I could think he was one of those who would
break their jests on the dead,
And mangle the living dog that had loved
him and fawned at his knee
Drenched with the hellish oorali—that ever
such things should be !”

CAN THEY SUFFER?

“The day may come when the rest of the
animal creation may acquire those rights which
never could have been withholden from them
but by the hand of tyranny. The question is
not ‘ can they reason ’ nor can they tat/a, but
can they suffer P”

AUGUSTE COMTE.

A SCIENTIFIC FAILURE.

“There can scarcely be imagined any
experiments less capable of true scientiﬁc
success than those of vivisection, though they
have been the most frequent. We must not
consider our rights (over animals) as absolutely

unlimited.”

LOSS OF REVERENT SENTIMENT.

“The simultaneous loss from the morals of
our ‘ advanced’ scientiﬁc men of all reverent
sentiment towards beings above them as
towards beings below is a curious and instruc-
tive phenomenon highly signiﬁcant of the
process which their natures are undergoing at
both ends.”

ITS INHUMANITY.

“Many vivisectors are not medical men at
all, and it has not yet become a proverb that
physiologists are humane. The general ten-
dency is obvious. . . . We are bound to see
that the sacred name of Science is not used as
a shelter for unworthy practices.”

—From " The Effects of Vivisection,” “ Comhill Magazine,”
April, 1876.

SIR LEWIS MORRIS.

THE PRIESTHOOD OF SCIENCE.

“ Surely a man should scorn
To owe his weal to others’ death and pain!

And for this goddess, Science, hard and
stem,

We shall not let her priests torment and
burn.

We fought the priests before-and not in
vain, .
And as we fought before, so we will ﬁght

again.”

 




 

 

 

JOHN RUSKIN.

SCIENCE DEFIES RELIGION.

“These scientiﬁc pursuits were now deﬁantly,
provokingly, insultingly separated from the
science of religion; they were all carried on in
deﬁance of what had hitherto been held to be
compassion and pity, and of the great link
which bound together the whole creation from
its Maker to the low-est creature.”

—S[9eech at Oxford, December 9th, 1884.

SIR HENRY TAYLOR, K.C.M.G.

(Author of “Philip 711m Arteveldt.”)

“' Pain, terror, mortal agonies which scare
Thy soul in man, to brutes thou wilt not
spare, .
Are theirs less sad and real? Pain in man
Bears the high mission of the ﬂail and fan;

In brutes ’tis purely piteous.”
——Frorn ” The Amphitheatre at Pozzuoli.”

THOMAS CARLYLE.

“WITH HORROR.”

“Ever since I was a boy I have never
thought of the practice of vivisecting animals
but with horror.”

MISS RHODA BROUGHTON.

BE KIND.

“We can never, whatever our future exer—
tions in their behalf may be, make up for the
arrears that humanity owes to the lower animals.
The brain reels in the effort to represent to
itself some faint picture of the amount of
physical pain inﬂicted in every age and every
country of the world by man upon his helpless
victims, victims of his war, of his peace, of his
malignity, of his stupidity, of his pseudo-
science, of his vanity, of his gluttony. . . . The
shadows lengthen. None of us will have much
time in which to be kind, therefore, in God’s
name, let us begin at once.”

—“ The Animals’ Friend,” June, 1895.

ROBERT BROWNING.

TRUE SYMPATHY.

“ I would rather submit to the worst of deaths,
so far as pain goes, than have a single dog or cat
tortured on the pretence of sparing me a tWInge

or two.”
——From a letter to Miss Cobbe, December 28th, 1874.

MONA CAIRD.
AN ILLEGITIMATE PRACTICE.

“Are there special nature laws in favour of
the physiologist, that he alone should be held
justiﬁed in pursuing legitimate ends by illegiti-
mate means? Suppose Art was also to set up a
claim to follow her vocation by torture; suppose
Religion reasserted her ancient privilege of
enforcing her teaching by ﬁre and sword! If
one profession or calling may do evil that good
may come, why may not all follow this creed?
Science herself accuses the vivisector of blas-

AN ABHORRENT PRACTICE.

those Who are without helper against you? . . .
It 15 the old story: the greed of knowing casts
out righteousness and mercy and faith. What-

ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION.

“ After some considerable reﬂection on the
matter, having read much that I would rather
not have read, and having thought on the matter
so much as I had the power, I have come to the
conclusion thatcontrol it you cannot, that the
evils of another kind are so great and the good
it professes to do so doubtful that on the whole
—-—all human affairs being on a balance—it is
right and proper that this Bill should pass and

that ‘Vivisection should be absolutely pro-
hibited.”

HORRIBLE EXPERIMENTSé—TRIVIAL FACTS.

“I have for some years come to the con-
clusion that nothing but tom! abolition will meet
the case of Vivisection. I am quite disgusted
at the frequency of the most horrible experi-
ments to determine the most trivial facts
recorded in the publications of scientiﬁc
societies month by month evidently carried on
for the interest of the ‘ research’ and the
reputation it gives.”

Be mine, are yours noless by native dower.

Saving such title as defames alike

science, looking forth over a world which will
then own no other sway than his, shall exult in

earth, if not a heaven for man, at least a hell for
animals-” - - « —” Pall Mall Gazette,” February, 1876.

spared the worst of all poSsible wrongs.”

character than to the physical comfort of those
of our ‘ fellow—creatures ’ who are most
immediately concerned.”

THE PRIESTHOOD OF PHYSIOLOGY.

“The comedy of high and pure intentions,
the scenic effect of the healer doing Violence to
his own nature in causing pain that he may cure
it, the theatrical mise-en-scéne of the arch-
benevolence forcing itself to hurt that it may
thus acquire power to soothe and save; these are
what, with the greatest care and caution, are put
before the world in general by the priesthood of
physiology. Nothing can be further from fact.
Throughout Europe and America, and in many
parts of Asia and Africa, the pursuit of
physiology is a profession like any other, a
career, a means to an end-—-—that end, like other
men’s, being money, celebrity and success.”
