The need for reform in all

mentatitm is at lastmaking its
impact on the American con-
science. A recent series of
pictures in Life magazine.
“Concentration Camps for
“Dogs”, powerful-1y dramatized
this need. Shown are dogs,
cats, pigeons, skunks and rac-
coons, crowded into filthy

 

crates too small to permit
.' standing; heavily chained and“

,emaciated dogs too weak to
gcrawl to the stale bread and

gfrozen entrails that comprise

the only food in sight; sick and'

hopelessoeyed puppies chained
to boxes, with only a frozen.
pan or, water nearby; a dog
frozen to death- in its box. A
humane society raid rescued 28
of the worst .cases. Some 75

_ dogs remained.

This is a sample of what
goes on in many such com-
pounds all over the United
States. To cash in on, the need
of experimental laboratories
l'for- almost 2 million dogs a.
year, “dog dealers”, buy dogs.
and other small animals
wherever they can. These,
most of them strayed or stolen
pets, are eventually sold to
laboratories, where they often
fare no better than they did
with the dealers. ‘

Who are guilty? The

oratories that buy. animals
which are obviously. lost or

course. But. guilty 'also are

its, abuses'and deman‘dno re-‘

quiring that those who sell dogs
and cats for this purpose and
the institutions that buy them be
licensed" by the Agriculture De-
partment and? maintain records

of their" dealings.

DR. ’ISSCIIER has expressed
the, point of View that the bill

would not prohibit experiments

on animals but .1 would “reduce

the supply to a trickle, slowing’
down medical discovery and ap-
plication,” as a result of which
the public would suffer. -
If stolen pets are necessary t
insure a ﬂow ‘of suitable ani
mals, then it 'is-about time th
supply was cut down. '
We can’t believe éthe oppo-
nents really support theft of ani-
mals, or} penning them in “ani-
mal concentration camps” while

 

awaiting delivery, or inhumane
treatment of any sort. The foes,
more probably, fear any" law at
all as a precedent which may
lead to even tighter restrictions
on their. efferts. '

WE WOULD ')SUSPECT, also,
that there is a wide difference in.
the termsby which animal lov-
ers and laboratory scientists
would define “inhumane treat-
ment.” - ‘ .

Regardless, licensing and re-
cord-keeping, and the establish-
ment of standards for housing
and transportation of animals,
are little enough to require of
dealers and institutions. Human.
progress may depend on the sac- ’
rifice of. animals, but it can
hardly gain through cruel and

callous handling of them.

Dogs and cats and humanitarians-

everywhere should rejoice at passage of
the Poage- Magnuson bill and its signing
into law by President Johnson. The act
is designed to bring an end to the steal-
ing of pets for medical research. We home
it accomplishes that objective.

Lest any readers doubt are need for
the law, we call their attention to The
Democrat and Chronicle’s expOse of last
year, “The Dog Dealers. ” It revealed
that thousands of pets were being sold
in a black market operation, and that
' state laws were woefully ineffective in .
Etopping the despicable trade. .

The Humane Society of the United
States believes that the new federal law
does not go far enough. The society ‘
wants tighter federal controls over the
use of animals in medical research. We
don’t think that such controls Would be

. wise —-- they would hamper researchers,
with red tape, curtailing the fruits of
medical progress.“ , .,

Medical researchers, nevertheless,
better put their animal houses in order

' if they have not already done so. If they .
don’t, it is a certainty that the public
will demand greater controls of‘ver their
activities. 3

Petnaping Law
Accepted by , _
Science 'Group

Byl‘Science Service

WASHINGTON —-- Medical
research can live with the
petnaping bill that became
law Aug. 24 after months oi:
dispute b e t we e n humane
groups and scientists. Presi-
dent Johnson signed the bill
yesterday.

 

Though i n s p e c tion and
registration of research facil-
ities were included in the
final draft, the new law c011-
tains enough safeguards to
protect medical experimenta-
tion, believes the ”National;
Society for MedicalResearch,
Whicli‘ “fi‘é‘ﬁ‘f’é‘é‘é‘ﬁ‘fé’a” scientific
interests throughout the con-
flict. ,

Intended to curb thefts of
family pets and their use as
laboratory animals, the legis-
latio also was aimed at a
larg r area—humane care of
animals by both dealers and
laboratories. ’

 

The new law requires dog
and cat dealers to, hold their
~ animals for five days before
selling them to laboratories.
Research facilities also must
keep records on the animals?

New law Puts I
Pa Cats, Dogs
On Equal Bass

LThe d1scr1m1nation against
cats in Pennsylvania came to an
one yesterday with the signing
of a federal law promoting b‘oth
510gs and c11ts. , -
4' The law gives the Federal
Government authority td curb
the theft of family degs and cats
for eventual use in scientific
and medical research.

The state has statutes protect-
ing dogs from this, but had
nothing for cats.

faraﬂels State Law

Robert Hudson, director of op-
erations for the Pennsylvania
Society ’for the Prevention of
£rue1ty to Animals, 350 E. Erie
iv" said the federal law close-
3y parallels the state law with
respect to the protection afford-
ed dogs. <

Where it differs, he said, is in
its inclusion of cats. .
31. The law empowers the Feder-
111 Government to require hu-
i'nane treatment of dogs and cats
by dealers in the business of
ﬂailing them t6 research insti-
itutions, includingU. S. agencies
. It also provides for a $1, 000
fine for any person who Steals
a family dog or cat for this pur-
" pose.

Favors Broader Law W

“In general, " said Hudson
“we are very pleased with the
legislation, although it would
have been nice 1th had passed
as originally written. ” "

When introduced into Con-
1 gress, the bill included all 'a'ni-

and it included supervisib'r'i‘
0 at as research labs as well as
the animal dealers. it was wa-
tered down to include only cats

dogs and the regulation of
on y th’é‘animals dealers.
, Huds6n said that the theft of
family dogs and cats had be-
come “a national outrage. " He
said the animal thieves would
scoops up the dogs and cats,1but
mostly the dogs, from streets
'and backyards and sell them to
dealers for $2 to $3, depending
on the size and weight of the
animal. . .

The dealer, he said, would
- then sell them to the research
lab for from, :10 to $20.

Finally Win C ongress’ VOtc

A BITTER STRUGGLE con-
mines to be waged in Congress
over the care and treatment of
animals used for experimenta-
tion in medical and surgical re-
search laboratories.

Humanitarians are eager 'to
root out the last vestige of. avoid-
able cruelty —- whether it be
consciously practiced or merely
the product of calloused indiﬁers

enoe -- from the confinement

and treatment or such animals.

Researchers usually deny any
maltreatment or mistreatment
and fight bitterly against pro-
' cedural (restrictions Which, they
claim, would hamper their ef
- forts to establish the causes. of.
1 and cures tor human ailments.

AT LONG LAST bdth the Sen-
ate and the House of Repre-
sentatives have passed remedial
measures but, unfortunately,

 

they differ 1n important respects
and await a Senate- House Con-
ference decision on which ver
sion 01' HR. 13881‘ shall be
adopted; .

retary of Agriculture to estab-
lish standards for humane treat-
ment by dealers, to license deal-
ers in dogs and cats, and to re-

quire? both; dealers and research
facilities to keep‘ records of their

animal purchases.

THE SENATE bill, however,
includes an amendment, pro-
posed by Sen. Mike Monroney of
Oklahoma, which would specifi-

cally require humane treatment.

mals are kept either before or
after experirfients

the whole Senate was convinced,
that the AMA protest is ill-
founded, that the prerogatives oi

SAFEGUARDS SEEN
IN LAW 0N PETS

Researchers Say Animals
and Work Are Protected

7

WASHINGTON (Science
Service)-—~Medical research can
“live with” the “theft of pets”
bill that finally became law
Aug. 24 aftér months of dis-
pute between humane groups
’and scientist's. ,

. Although inspection and reg-
istra of research facilities
were included in the final draft,
the new law contains enough
safeguards to protect medical
experimentation, according to
the National Scoiety for Med-
ical Research, which has rep-
resented scientific interests,
throughout the conflict.

. Besides serving as a curb on
the’ theft of family pets and
their use as laboratory‘ an mals,
the legislation was aim
larger area—the humane care
of animals by dealers and lab-‘
oratories alike. This has been
accomplished, Says the medical
society, while preserving the
integrity 61? medical research.

' Instead of licensing labora-
‘tofries, , as humane. groups
Wanted and medical interests
feared, the law provides for a
system of registration. It opens
laboratories to inspection and
Set down penalties for sub-
standard animal care as de-
termmed \jgy the Secretary. of
Agriculture But, mast impor~
taiit to medical research, the,
licensing Clause was deleted and;
Violation of standards does not
mean Withdrawal of Govern-
ment mone'yn

‘Medical research has devel-
foped so fast in the past decade
that laboratory animal facilities
nave been Somewhat short-
changed, and , most medical
authorities believe a licensing
pr6vision would have crippled
the nation’s research effort.

As for actual thefts of pets,
the new law requires dog and
cat dealers to hold their animals
for five days before selling them
to laboratories. Also research
facilities must keep records on
the animals, all of which
should give OWners a chance to
recOVer lost pets before they
become subjects of an experi-‘
ment.

Hopefully, the new bill Will
put out of, business those
dealers who hate caused a
storm of public protest with
their widely publicized mis-
treatment of animals. They now
must buy licenses and adhere,
to standards. ,

Meanwhile, the laboratories
are protected against harass-

ment by humane grOups. '

Senate Passes

Pet safety Bill

United Press International

The Senate passed and sent
to the White House yesterday
legislation to combat the theft
of pets \and provide humane
treatment for animals used in
research; -

‘Sen. Warren G. Magnuson,
(D-Wash.,) who presented the
compromise to the Senate,
called it “a landmark measure
in the field of animal welfare
legislation.” It passed by voice
vote. , , <

The bill would control and
regulate the transportation of
cats and dogs and foster
humane care and treatment
for animals in research
laboratories. _

agency took the position that, if a tax-
payer had once been certiﬁed as having
met the minimum requirements of his
position, he would always be consid-
ered to have met them. An example is
a teacher with a BA degree and a
permanent teaching certiﬁcate in a state
that suddenly changes its certification
requirement to a master’s degree. Un-
der the present rules the teacher may
deduct the cost of the required further
training; under the new proposal, he
may not—because the additional edu-
cation is undertaken to attain the mini-
mum required standard. The IRS be-
lieves that this ruling will eliminate an
inequity under the present laws: a
February graduate who has taught for
one semester, for example, may cur-
rently deduct expenses incurred in

House and Senate conferees agreed
last week on a version of controversial
legislation to regulate the handling of
dogs, cats, and certain other animals
used in research. The legislation has
been around for so long, has been the
object of so much position-trading, and
has such complex implications in terms
of the long battle between scientists and
the humane movement that conven~
tional descriptions of the bill as “strong”
or “weak” seem no longer to apply.
The bill does not provide for federal
regulation of actual experimentation on
animals, a perennial objective of large
segments of the humane movement.
But it does provide for considerable
federal regulation. of what goes on in.
research laboratories before and after
the animals leave the operating table——
something the scientists had hOped to
avoid. In short, the bill, appears likely
to leave all interests partly satisﬁed and
partly dissatisﬁed. All the parties have
more cards up their sleeves: in the case
of the humane movement, plans for
further legislation; in the case of the
research community, hopes to forestall

846

“operation with federal

meeting upgraded state requirements,
whereas a June graduate who has never
taught nay not deduct her further
expenses.

Even if the IRS regulations were
ﬂawless in both logic and fairness, how-
ever, tthey would still touch on a basic
contradiction: the government is giving
away a lot of money for education
with one hand (under NDEA and
many other programs) and taking it
back with the other. It is this contra-
diction that bothers the NBA and that
may yet prompt Congressional inter-
vention. Nearly half the members of
the US. Senate have already associ—
ated themselves (as either sponsors or
cosponsors) with bills that Would make
educational deductions an express na-
tional policy. Similar moves are under-

such legislation by Strengthening self-
regulation. All these factors add up to
the conclusion that this particular war
is not yet over.

The bill approved by the conference
committee (HR 13881) provides for
the Secretary of Agriculture to license
dealers who buy and sell dogs and
cats in interstate commerce. Research
institutions are required to register with
the Secretary of Agriculture, but need
not be licensed. Dealers and institutions
are required to keep records of the
purchase, sale, transportation, identiﬁ-
cation, and previous ownership of dogs
and cats. Monkeys, hamsters, guinea
pigs, and rabbits are included under
humane standard provisions that are
binding on both dealers and institu-
tions, but records are not required for
them.

The Secretary of Agriculture, in co-
agencies and
other interested parties, is authoriZed to
establish standards governing the hu-
mane care, treatment, handling, and
transportation of animals by both deal-
ers and research institutions. These

way in the House, and, while they may
amount to little more than election-
year gambits—tax deductions are espe-
cially popular with the folks back
home, and this particular IRS ei’lort
has drawn a lot of mail—it appears
that the IRS is in no great hurry to
advance implementation of the regula-
tions. The 30 days allotted for ﬁling
complaints and requests for a hearing
were up last week, but the IRS has not
yet set a hearing date. This does not
necessarily in an, as the NEA hopes,
that the IRS is backing oil, but the
agency does appear to be moving cau-
tiously. The most that can be said at this
moment is that, while both death and
taxes remain certain, some taxes are
more certain than others.

——EL1N0R LANCER

standards will include minimum require-
ments concerning housing, feeding,
watering, sanitation, ventilation, shelter,
separation by species, and veterinary
care. These standards, however, will
not apply to institutions during the
conduct of the actual research. or ex-
perimentation.

The Secretary of Agriculture is au-
thorized to make necessary investiga-
tions to see that dealers and research
units are complying with departmental
regulations: inspectors are authorized
to conﬁscate or destroy any animals
found to be suﬁ’ering either as a result
of violations of the humane standards
regulations or unnecessarily beyond the
duration of the experiments for which
they were utilized. Dealers and research
institutions are required to open their
premises and records to inspectors and
to law-enforcement agencies in search
of lost animals.

The penalties for an animal dealer
found in violation include suspension of
his license and .i-year imprisonment or
a $1000 ﬁne or both. For research
facilities there is a civil penalty of
$500 for each offense, with the added
proviso that each daily continuation of
a violation constitutes a separate of-
fense. The punitive provisions include
the customary opportunities for admin-
istrative hearings and review.

Floor debate on the bill will be either
nonexistent or brief, as it has already
been thoroughly discussed in both
Houses. Anything but easy passage for
the bill is extremely unlikely; and the
new deal for dogs and cats is practically
under way—EL.

The researchers fought they

legislation as an infringement of
their rights to conduct what
they consider experiments need-
ed for the public welfare. They
said that the bill could lead to
limitations or a prohibition
against the use of animals in
experiments.

The humane society members
argued among themselves over
whether the President should
sign the bill. They staged a
large mail campaign both for it
and against it.

One group of humane Society
members complained that the
bill is too weak in its non-ap-
plicability to actual research
projects. But the law is just
tough enough, they said, to block
consideration of another strong-
er‘measure by Congress for
many years.

This position was held by the
Humane Society of the United
States and the American Hu-
mane Association.

_ A First Step

But the Society for Animal
Protective Legislation and the
Animal Welfare Institute favor-
ed the law as a first step which
would provide more humane
treatment of animals now while
work progresses for stricter leg-
islation later.

Leading this group was Mrs.
Christine Stevens, wife of presi-
dential special assiStant Roger
Stevens.

The law gives the responsi-
bility for seeing that animals are
humanely treated to the secre-
tary of agriculture.

Critics of the bill said that
the research institutions will by

of the door to strong antivivisec- '

tionist laws.

The issue was dramatically rev
opened last year when Rep. Jo-
seph Y. Resnick (D- -NY) became
interested in the subject of dog—
naping. Ile had investigated the
alleged theft of a family dog in
Pennsylvania for sale to a Bronx
hospital.

Resmck was told that many
pets 1:1 .cd in research were stol-
en fmm homes and bar (yards,
and that research animals were
often mistreated.

Resnick introduced legislation
to control the theft of pets and

Senate Measure .

Clark and Sen. Warren G.

a similar bill

Then the letter writing cam~

over the past year it received
more than 20, 000 letters on dog-

Promptly on that day,

I By Drew Pearson

. «WASHINGTON—An interesting
little bonfire which took place in
Harthrd, Conn., on Feb. 15, plays
a small part in the Sen. Dodd in-
vestigation. It should play a big’

part in rewriting the laws regard-

ing political contributions.
Feb. 15 was shertly after the

deadline required for preserving
records of the campaign costs

and contributions for the 1964 Sen-
ate election in Connecticut.
Demo-

» cratic friends of Sen. Dodd in the

State House took out his cam-

. paign records and burned them.

When, Republican State Chair.
man A. Searle Pinney sent for the
records, they were gone. Fortu-
nately, Jack Anderson had had
the foresight to make copies of
the more important items in
Dodd’s campaign, budget.

However, the Connecticut bon-

fire illustrates the fact that rec-
Ords of campaign contributions

and campaign costs are kept in a
slipshod manner in’ most of

the United States, and that one of
the most important steps in elect-

ing competent public servants

' without getting them. in hock to

lobbyists is to reform the Corrupt
Practices Act. .-

PreSident Johnson in his Janu4

ary "StateOfl the Union Message

'from Texas, he was urged by the

Missouri introduced legislation to
reform the Corrupt Practices Act

, .and so did the late Sen. Richard
N euberger of Oregon.

1' Biggest item in any candidate’s

campaign budget is television.
Both political parties pay through

, the teeth for TV space, but unless

they dothey may lose the elec-

on money and on the stage man-

THE PUBLIC DOESN’T know

it, but Minnesota, congressmen
have been applying the knife to
legislation protecting dogs used
for vivisection and laboratory
tests. .
Rep. W. R. Poage. D-Tex., in.-
troduced an excellent bill requrr-
ing laboratories and .dealers who
handle dogs for medical purposes
to keep them in decent cages and
give them humane treatment. .
Supplying dogs to laboratorles
has become more of an industry
than most people realize. Mike
Kredowski' of Freidensburg, Pa.,
who operates the Lone Trail Keny
nels, says he sells 60,000 dogs a
year to laboratories. _
KredOWSki operates human
kennels and takes good care of his
dogs. But some of the supplying

nesota senator have quietly meat- '

axed one of the most important
sections out of Poage’s bill. Reps.

,Albert ,Quie, Ancher Nelsen, an

Alec Olson (D), all of Minnesota,
succeeded in deleting the word
“laboratories” from the bill. .

thew Law Puts

‘Pa. Cats, Dogs
On Equal Basis

i The discrimination against
cats in Pennsylvania came to an
and yesterday with the signing
of a federal/law protecting both
dogs and cats. ‘

The law gives . the Federal
Government authority to curb
the theft of family dogs and cats
for eventual use in scientific
and medical research.

The state has statutes protect-
ing dogs from this, but had
nothing for cats. '
Parallels State Law

Robert Hudson, director of op-
erations for the Pennsylvania
Society'for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, 350 E. Erie

iportation, identification and pre-

 

 

av., said the federal law close-
ly parallels the state law with
respect to the protection afford-
ed dogs. ' '
Where it differs, he said, is in
its inclusion of cats. -

The law empOwers the Feder-
al Government to require hu-
mane treatment of dogs and cats
by dealers in the business of
selling them to research insti-

 

 

tutions, including U. S. agencies.
It also provides for a $1,000
fine for any person who steals

a family dog or cat for this pur-
“088.

 

E

Records Required .
Dealers and research facili-

ties would be required to keep
records of purchase, sale, trans-

vious ownership of dogs and
cats. In addition, means of iden-
tification of the dogs and cats
would be required. .

Dealers could be fined as rnuc

as $1,000 and/or sent to‘prison
for as much as a‘ year if they
do not obserVe standards in
shelter, water, food, veterinary
care and sanitation for the' ani-
mals.

Favors Broader Law

“In eneral," said Hudson.
“we arg very pleased with the
legislation, although it would
have been nice if it had passed
as originally written.”
When introduced into gem
gress, the bill included “1.33.3:
mals and it included supervmon
"o‘f‘vthe research labs as well as
the animal dealers. It was wa-
tered down to include only cats
and dogs and the regulation of
onlv the animals dealers.

Hudson said that the theft of
familydogs and cats had, be-
come “a national outrage. He
said the animal thieves would
scoops up the dogs and cats, but
mostly the dogs, from streets
and backyards and sell them. to
dealers for $2 to 33, depending
on the size and weight of the

imal.
inThe dealer, he said, would:
then" sell them to the research

 

 

lab for from $10 to $20. ’3’

2/ Amendment on Treatment In Research Labs Causes Furor

Antidognapihg Bill Provision Splits Humane Groups

By Longresslonal Quarterly

WASHINGTON - The animal
welfare movement of the United
States has split wide open over
a provision of the “antiddgnap-
ping” bill, which is now being
put in final form by a House-
Senate conference committee.

The provision was sponsored
by Sen. A. S. Mike Monroney,
D-Okla.. and included in the
Senate Version of the measure.
'It permits the secretary of agri-

culture to move into research"

laboratories to prevent neglect

and mistreatment of laboratory

animals while they are being
held by the laboratories before
and after experimentation.

It does not allow the secre
tary to interfere with the actual
conduct of research or to im-
pose any conditions for thehand-
ling of animals during actual
. research. - I

. . Some of the animal welfare
groups, led by the Humane So-
ciety of the United States and
inciudin the American Humane
ASSOCia ion, the two biggest or-
ganizations, favor dropping the
laboratory care provision alto-

gcther. They believe it is too_

weak and fear its enactment
wouidl‘take the steam out of a
dong -term drive for much strong-
er legislation on humanetreat-
ment of laboratory animals.

amendment. A few of the ani-
mal welfare organizations favor
killing the entire bill as too

weak -—- not only the provisions.

,on care in laboratories but also

the basic “antidognapping” pro-

'visions.

The National Catholic Society
for Animal Welfare, for exam-
ple, July 10 staged an Bil-woman
picketing demonstration at the
White House, asking the Pres-
ident to veto the bill when it
finally reached him because
both the House and Senate ver-
sions were far too weak.

Ii! a It!

From the beginning, the “anti-

' dognapping” measure has been

one of the most massively lob-
bied bills in recent yeaIs. The
campaign for an “antidognap-
ping” measure was kicked off
in mid- 1965 by Rep. Joseph Y.
Resnick, D-N. Y., as a result of
a case involving alleged theft
of a family pet for sale to a
hospital in the Bronx for re-
search purposes.

Humane societies and animal
w e 1 f a r e organizations began
mounting a massive letter-writ-
ing campaign to Congress,
which by mid- 1966 saw over

60,006 letters sent to the House

20,000 to the Senate Commerce

Committee, the two g r o u p s
which handled the “antidognap-

had been a tremendous growth
of biomedical and drug research
where animals were used for
experiments. Much of the re
search was conducted or fi-
nanced by the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare‘s
National Institutes of Health.
The most conservative sources
estimated that there were at
least 50 to 60- million animals
used for research annually,
mainly rats and mice, but also
guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits,

monkeys and perhaps as many

as 2 million dogs and cats.

Humane organizations charge

- that crooks and unscrupulous in-
dividuals, seeking to turn a fast

buck, go around stealing dogs
and cats from the streets and
backyards for sale through ani-
mal dealers to research institu-
tions.

They also charge, and demon-
strated in a widely publicized se-
ries of raids on animal dealers,
that conditions at animal deal-
ers holding dogs and cats for
sale to laboratOries are some-
times extremely inhumane -— in-
volving starvation, overcrowd-
ing, lack of water, pdor sanita~
tion and excessive physical re-
straint of the animal in tiny
cages.

As a result of the charges and
publicity, the House and Senate
both passed “antidognapping”
measures early in 1966 that
would empower the Secretary of
Agriculture, through a system
of licensing, to, combat the theft

'with the bill.

of animals for sale to labora-
tories and to require animal
dealers to observe humane
practices with regard to food,
sanitation and housing in the
handling, transportation and’
sale of research animals. '

The House version applied
only to dogs and cats, while
the Senate version applied to
some other animals as well.

Virtually the entire humane ,
movement agreed on these pro- ‘
visions. But Sen. Monroney’ s .
proposal to let the secretary of j.
agriculture require humane .
care of animals which were al-
ready in research institutions
brought the tremendous split in
the animal welfare movement.

Humane organizations are not
the only ones vitally concerned

stitutes of Health and the na- '-
tional biomedical research com- ,

Imunity, whose spokesman is.

the National Society for Medical
Research, deeply feared the
Monroney provision, or any pro-
vision that would impose con-
trols on the use or handling of
animals by research institu—
tions. However, after the Com-
mittee had watered down the .
Monroney provision by allowing
research institutions themselves
to determine when animals are
being used for the actual con-
duct of research -—- and there"
fore are exempt from the Sec-
retary of Agriculture’s regula-
tion —— the National Institutes of
Health indicated it would ac-
cept the Senate Commerce verr
sion.

[Research PmV1Sion 111 Antidognaping

By CONGRESSIONAL QUARTERLY

ASHINGTON—The animal welfare movement of' the .

nited States has split wide open over 'a provision of the

.h“antidog1iaplng” bill, which is now being put in finallform
. by a House-Senate conference committee.

The provision was sponsored by Sen. A. S. Mike Monroney,
Dkala., and included in the Senate version of the measure.
It permits the secretary of agriculture to move into research

laboratories to prevent neglect and mistreatment of labora- 1

tory animals while they are being held by the laboratories
before and after experimentation

It does not allow the secretary to interfere with the actual
conduct of research or to impose any conditions for the handl-

.ing of animals during actual research.

Society of the United States and including the American '

SOME 01“ the animal welfare groups, led by the Humane

:-Humane Association, the two biggest organizations, favor
'dropping the laboratory care provision altogether. They be-
‘lieve it is too weak, and they fear that its enactment would

take the steam out of a long term drive for much stronger .

{legislation on humane treatment of laboratory animals.

The stronger legislation, which the humane organizations

would permit the government to require the maximum pos-
,sible humane treatment of laboratory animals during the
_' actual conduct of research itself.

This stronger legislation is fiercely opposed by nearly the

'entire biomedical research community and the National Insti-

tutes of Health, the major research agency, for fear

;it would hamper medical research and even possibly lead
';to antivivisectionist measures later on.

A SECOND faction of the animal welfare movement, led by

ers. Christine Stevens, the wife of Roger Stevens, who is

J

jchairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing“:

A. .1“.

Arts and the President’s adviser on the arts, has been fight-
ing in favor of the Monroney amendment.

Mrs. Stevens heads th V for A ' 7 gis-
lation and the Animal Welfare Inst1tute. The groups support-
ing her include the Virginia Federation of Humane Societies,
the Massachusetts Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals and WARDS (Welfare of Animals Used for Research

in Drugs and Surgery), whose chairman is the wife of Sen.
MonrOney.

MRS. STEVENS argues that the publicity Over the past
year on the kidnaping of pets for sale to medical research
institutions has given the animal welfare movement an un-‘

’ precedented opportunity to pass an “antidognaping” meet-

' in laboratories now, she says, while continuing to

sure. Why not include some provisions on humane tre ment
ork fora,
later passage of stronger legislation. She does not baheve
retention of the Monroney amendment would arm the
chances of future legislation . .

- In recent weeks, the two different factions of the animal
welfare movement have been conducting letter-writing cam-
paigns over the issue of whether to adopt the Monroney
amendrhent. The House Agriculture Committee said it had

Ranks Are Split

By Congressional Quarterly

WASHINGTON -~ The ani
mal welfare movement ofthe
United States has split wide
open over a provision of the
“antidognapping” bill, which is
now being put in final form by
.1 llouse- Senate conference com.
mittee.

- The provision was sponsored
by Sen. A.S. Mike Monroney
"(D-Okla.) and included in the
iSenate version of the measure.
it permits the Secretary of Ag-
riculture to move into research
laboratories to prevent neglect
and mistreatment of laboratory
,animals whilethey are being
held by the laboratories before
and after experimentation.“ It
does not allow the Secretary to
interfere with the actual con-
duct of research or to. impose
any conditions for the handling
of animals during actual re-
search. ,.

Some of the animal welfare
groups, led by the Humane So-
ciety of the United States and
including the American Humane
. Assn., the two biggest organiza‘
tions, favor dropping the labor-
atory. care provision altogether.
They, believe it is too weak, and
they fear 'that' its enactment
would take the steam out of a
long- -te1m drive for much strong-
er legislation 0n humane treat-
ment of laboratory animals. ,-

The stronger legislatlmi,
which the humane organiza-

tions have been pushing for

 

six years With relatively lit

 

tle success, would permit the
Government to require the
maximum possible humane
treatment of laboratory ani-
mals during the actual con-
duct of research itself. ‘This
stronger legislation is fierce-
ly opposed by nearly the en-
tire biomedical research
eommunity and the National

jor federal research agency,
for fear it would hamper med-
ical research and even pos-
sibly lead to antivivisectlonist
measures later on.

A second faction of the ani-
mal welfare movement, led by
Mrs. Christine Stevens” ( the
wife of Roger Stevens, who is
chairman of the John F. Ken-
nedy Center for the Perform-
ing Arts and the President’s

Massachusetts Society for Pre-
vention of Cruelty. to Animals
and WARDS (Welfare of Ani-

Mrs. Stevens argues that
the publicity over the past year
on the kidnapping of pets for
sale to medical research insti-
tutions ,has 1, given the animal

 

welfare movement an unprece-
dented opportunity to pass an
“antidognapping” - measure.
Why not include some provi-
sions on humane treatment in
laboratories now, she says,
while continuing to 'work for
later passage of stronger legis-l
lation. She does not believe re-
tention of the Monroney amend-
ment would harm the chances
of future legislation.

‘ In recent weeks, the two

By Congressional Quarterly

WASHINGTON -- The anim-

13 now being put in final form
b a House-Senate conference
Cpmmittee.

'The proVision was sponsored
b Sen. A. S. Mike Monroney

5 hate version of the measure.
Iti permits the Secretary of
to move into
research laboratories to pre‘
Vent neglect and mistreatment
of laboratory animals while

. they are being held by the la-

boratories before and after ex-
Derimentation. It does not al-
low the Secretary to interfere
With the actual conduct of
Research or to impose any con-
ditions for the handling of
animals during actual

Humane Assn., the two big-
gie st organizations, favor
Provision altogether. They' be-
lieve it is too Weak, and they

A second faction of the

by Mrs. Christine Stevens (the
wife of Reger Stevens, who is
chairman of the John F. ken-
nedy Center for the Perform-

adviser on the arts) has been
fighting in favor of the MOpro—

In recent weeks, the two dif-

of whether to adopt the Monro-

'A few of the animal welfare
organizations favor killing the
entire bill as too weak -- not
only the provisions on care in
laboratories but also the basic,
“antidognapp'ing" provisions.

ample, July 10, staged an 80

Lab Care Amendment

[Chicago Tribune Press Service]
’W WWW-ﬁg 3 — The
animal welfare movement of
the United States has split wide
Open over a prOvision of the
anti-dognaping bill now being
put in final form by a House-
Senate conference committee.
The provision was sponsored
by Sen. Mike Monroney [D.,
Okla. ] and included in the Sen-
ate version of the measure. It
permits the secretary of agri-
culture to move into research
laboratories to prevent neglect
streatment of laboratory
agingi; while they are being
held by the laboratories before
and after experimentation.

It does not allow the secre- '

tary to interfere With the ac-
tual conduct of research or to
impose any conditions for the
handling of animals during ac-
tual research, Congressional
Quarterly reported. .

Some of the animal welfare
groups, led by the Humane So-
ciety of The United States and
including the American Humane
association, the two biggest or-
ganizations, favor drOpping the
laboratory care provision alto-
gether. ~

The National Catholic Society?
for Animal Welfare, for exam-3
ple, recently staged an 80-wom-
an picketing demonstration at
the White House, asking the?
President to veto the bill when
it finally reached him because
both the House and Senate ver-
sions were far too weak. i
From the beginning, the anti-;
dognaping measure has been
one of the most massively lob-
bied bills in recent years. The
campaign for such a measure;
was kicked off in mid- 1965 by

3Rep. Joseph Y. Resnick [D.,;

N. Y.] as a result of a case
involving alleged theft of a
family pet for sale to a hos-
pital in the Bronx for research
purposes.

Bill Splits Animal Welfare Movement

The campaign for an “antidognaping’? measure was kicked
off in mid-1965 by Rep. Joseph Y. Resnick, D-N.Y., as a
result of a case involving alleged theft of a family pet for
sale to a hospital in the Bronx for research purposes. I

THE CASE was given wide publicity by Resnick, Sen.
Joseph S. Clark, D-Pa., and other members of Congress, as
well as by many newspapers. Humane societies and animal
welfare organizations began mounting a massive letter-writ-
ing campaign to Congress, which by mid-1966 saw over 60,000
letters sent to the House Agriculture Committee and over
20,000 to the Senate Commerce Committee, the two groups
which‘handled the “antidognaping” bills. Individual mem-
bers of Congress also received heavy mail, in many cases
heavier than on any other legislation.

Advocates of federal legislation to curb “dognaping” point-
' ed out that in recent years there had been a tremendous

growth of biomedical and drug research where animals were
used for experiments.

Much of the research was conducted or ﬁnanced. by the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare’s National Insti-
tutes of Health. The most conservative sources estimated

that there were at least 50 to 60 million animals used for'

research annually, mainly rats and mice, but also guinea

pigs, hamsters, rabbits, monkeys and perhaps as many as

2 million dogs and cats.

MOST OF the rats and mice are specifically bred for re- “

search purposes, but the dogs and cats are usually purchased
by the research institutions from animal dealers or city
pounds, often bringing up to $30 each for larger dogs.

Humane organizations charge that crooks and unscrupulous
individuals, seeking to turn a fast buck, go around stealing
' dogs and cats from the streets and backyards for sale through

animal dealers to research institutions. They also charge,
and demonstrated in a widely publicized series of raids on
animal dealers, that conditions at animal dealers holding '
dogs and cats for sale to laboratories are sometimes ex-

. research itself.

-..9_ ..__._. .

 

tremely inhumane, involving starvation, overcrowding, lack of

water, poor sanitation and excessive physical restraint of th:
animal in tiny cages. . - , '

'AS A RESULT of the charges and publicity, the House ani-

Senate both passed “antidognaping” measures early in 196i
that would empower the secretary of agriculture, through g

.system 0f licensing, to combat the theft of animals for sale tg?’

laboratories and to require animal dealers to observe humans
practices with regard to food, sanitation and housing in th:
handling, transportation and sale of research animals. Tht

.House version applied only to dogs and cats, while the Senaté'

version applied to some other animals as well.

Virtually the entire humane movementiagreed on these pro:

‘ visions. But Sen. Monroney’s proposal to let the secretary oi

agriculture require humane care of animals which were at

ready in research institutions brought the tremendous split ' .
the animal welfare movement.

HUMANE organizations are not the only ones vitally con
cerned with the bill. The National Institutes of Health ant.
the national biomedical research community, whose spokes;-
man is the National Society for Medical Research, deeply
feared the Monroney provision, or any provision that would

impose controls on the use or handling of animals by researcl:
institutions.

The two at first worked strenuously to defeat the Monronej'
amendment in the Senate Commerce Committee. However‘
after the committee had watered down the Monroney pro;
vision by allowing research institutions themselves to deter;
mine when animals are being used for the actual conduct
research, and therefore are exempt from the secretary
agriculture’s regulation, the National Institutes of Healt
indicated it would accept the Senate commerce version. A,
spokesman said acceptance of the revised Monroney amend:

. ment would block, for at least five years, any major publié

support for stronger legislation. regulating the conduct/oi

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE SOCIETY FOR
ANIMAL PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION
BOX 3719, GEORGETOWN STATION
WASHINGTON, 0.0. 20007
TEL: FE 7—5414
Washington, August 24, 1966, President Johnson today signed the bill to
require humane care and housing of animals for research and to prevent
theft of dogs and cats for sale to scientific institutions. Speaking to
fourteen members of the Senate and House of Representatives who sponsored

or worked for legislation for this purpose and to animal protective work—

ers present for the ceremony, he said,

"I am delighted to see my friends from the Congress and others

here this morning to witness the signing of the bill that the Congress
has passed to end the business of stealing dogs and cats for sale to
research facilities and to provide for humane handling and treatment of
animals by dealers and research facilities.

”As Dr. Schweitzer has reminded us: 'The quality of a culture is
measured by its reverence for all life.'

"Progress, particularly in science and medicine, does require the
use of animals for research and this bill does not interefere with that.
But science and research do not compel us to tolerate the kind of in—
humanity which has been involved in the business of supplying stolen
animals to laboratories or which is sometimes involved in the careless
and callous handling of animals in some of our laboratories.

"This bill will put an end to these abuses. At the same time the
bill does not authorize any sort of interference with actual research or
experimentation. They just must go on.

I'But I am sure that all of us are very glad that the Congress has
wisely seen fit to make provision for decent and humane standards in the
procurement and handling of the animals that are necessarily involved.

"I thank those of you who are here for coming here for this ceremony.
I appreciate the efforts that you have made to make this event possible.

I have no doubt but with the passing of the years, the wisdom of your

action will be thoroughly demonstrated."

(over)

 




This is the second major piece of animal protective legislation for
which the President has acted. In 1958 as Majority Leader of the
Senate, he gave powerful support to the Federal Humane Slaughter Law
which has successfully protected the bulk of the Nation's meat animals
against needless suffering in slaughter houses. Representative W. R.
Poage (D.,Tex.) sponsor of the bill signed today, was author of the

Humane Slaughter Act.

Senator Warren D. Magnuson (D., Wash.), Chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, and sponsor with Senator Joseph S. Clark (D., Penna.) and
Daniel Brewster (D., Md.) of the Senate bill for humane care of research
animals and prevention of pet theft, also has a record of achievement in
the field as author of the bill against mistreatment of wild animals
being imported into this country.

Senator A. S. (Mike) Monroney (D., Okla.) was responsible for legislation
on funds for construction of decent animal quarters for laboratory animals

in 1957. Other members of Congress present for the signing included

Representative Joseph Y. Resnick (D., N.Y.) author of the first bill

against dog and cat theft, Senator Hugh Scott (R., Penna.) sponsor of a
Senate bill identical to Representative Poage's, Representatives Catherine
May (R., Wash.), Graham Purcell (D., Tex.), Henry Helstoski (D., N.J.),
Stanley Greigg (D., Iowa), George Grider (D., Tenn.), Claude Pepper

(D., Fla.), Frank Horton (R., N.Y.), and Clarence D. Long (D., Md.).

Dear Barry:

Your program with Cleveland Amory, etc., regarding
cruelty to laboratory animals was indeed a public service be-

cause not very many people know what is being done to animals
in the laboratories.

Incidentally, I would like to alert you that, out
of the many bills now pending in Congress, ONLY ONE contains
provision for enforcement that is adequate to afford any
degree of protection to laboratory animals; this is the bill
introduced in the House by Rep. Randall. This bill places
enforcement in the hands of an agency within the Justice
Department, out of reach of the researchers themselves, in-
cluding the Department of Health, Education and Welfare which

is also in need of policing since it is guilty of cruelty to
laboratory animals.

Please do schedule further such programs. There is
critical need for public education in this field.

Sincerely,
(.

Dear Christine:

To show how busy Emily and I have been, I have had your letter of
September 9th in a pile awaiting reply since early September. There was
nothing urgent about your letter, so I kept putting off a reply.

Enclosed is copy of a letter I am.sending to the producer of the
Les Crane Show, on which Cleveland Amory and Dr. Morris Fishbein appeared
twice, supposedly to discuss laboratory legislation. Actually, it turned
out to be a battle about vivisection. I hope that you had an opportunity to
view at least one of these shows. In any event, you undoubtedly have heard
about them. My letter to the producer of the Les Crane Show is designed to
indicate an interest on the part of somebody not connected with humane organ-
izations, but merely a general viewer. I think that might be more effective
than to address a letter to them dealing solely with the laboratory legisla—
tion. I hope you will not think I have taken your name and good looks in
vain: TV producers are interested in such matters.

When I wrote to you on August 26th I did not have in mind making
any contributions at the moment. I have enough along that line in connection
with my HSUS affiliation at present. What I had in mind was my will, to
which I am still giving consideration. Thank you for the comments about
humane needs. ‘

Emily and I have been working on a program for the HSUS to put more
pressure from the grass roots on the members of Congress in connection with
laboratory legislation, and other matters.

Could you give me the street address of Mr. N. E. Wernberg in
Copenhagen. He is the man working on the C02 equipment for poultry.

The Les Crane Show
WABC Television Network
New York, New York

Dear Sir:

A few weeks ago I filled out a TV diary for the A. C. Nielsen
Company, the second time this year. Apparently they are using me fOr a TV
guinea pig. That makes me worth, to you, several hundred thousand ordinary
TV viewers, because my diary showed I viewed the Les Crane Show for the full
time period every night in the week.

You can return the favor by doing a few things for me on the Les
Crane Show:

(1) Have another go at the question of legislation to regulate
medical laboratories' use of animals. The two programs with Cleveland Amory
and Morris Fishbein turned into an anti-vivisection argument, which is
entirely beside the point. The only issue is the prevention of'avoidable
cruelties to the animals used in laboratories, which would_ng£ hamper medical
research, but actually improve it. Poorly-kept animals befog the results of
medical research, and studies by experts in experimental design show that far
more animals than are necessary for the best results are used in a large pro-
portion of the experiments. The anti~vivisectionists are opposed to labora-
tory regulation,‘and those behind the proposed legislation are just as much
against the anti-vivisectionists as they are the shortsighted doctors who fear
that sensible regulation would lead to eventual prohibition.

May I suggest that on your next discussion of this subject you put
on the panel, alone or with Cleveland Amory, a beautiful, charming, articulate
and exceptionally well informed woman who lives in New York, and is head of
the Animal Welfare Institute, 22 East 17th Street, New York 10003. Her name
is Christine Stevens. Mrs. Stevens is a patrician who would blush to hear me
say this, but she has sex appeal as well as ability to present her viewPoint,
and the men in your audience who have no interest in animals or laboratories
nevertheless would certainly enjoy any program on which she appeared.

(2) Now, just to indicate to you that those interested in programs
such as the foregoing are not all fuddy-duddy old ladies, I would like to see
Les Crane have on his program Nipsey Russell, the colored singer, comedian and
dancer, for a full half hour to explain and demonstrate all of the new dances,
including the Watusi, the dog, the frugge, the ska, the monkey, etc. The teen-
agers on the Dick Clark Show and the Lloyd Thaxton Show from.LA do it one way,
and not very well if you want my opinion, while those in the Southeastern part
of the United States have an entirely different style. I am sure that a very
large number of your viewers would be quite interested in a detailed exposition
of this subject by Nipsey Russell, who is a past master at demonstrating

I ,

 




Producer

these different dances. He was on the Ed Sullivan and Andy Williams Shows,
and might be too high priced for a late night show. Another discussion having
similar interest would be an exposition by Les Crane and some musician of the
difference between rock and roll and other dance music. Les obviously is in-
terested in this general subject, and it would be excellent material for an
informed discussion. In fact, if you would devote one entire evening to a
discussion of rock and roll and the latest dances that have grown out of it,
and have announced this well in advance, I would predict that you would in-
crease your audience size tremendously for that night.

(3) Have Dayton Allen on the show again and again.

You may be interested in the enclosed review of the Les Crane Show
from the St. Petersburg Times, which is not at all complimentary. I find him
much more stimulating than even my former favorite, Johnny Carson.

Renewed Threat to Science

The time has come when physi-
cians, biologists, physiologists, scien-
tists, and citizens generally should
cease to be on the defensive. The time
has come when political leaders,
statesmen, and other representatives
of the people must declare themselves
ﬁrmly in favor of animal experimenta—
tion for the beneﬁt of mankind and see
to it that the medical profession, the
great industries, the great institutions
of learning need not be put to the ex-
pense year after year of defending this
cause against unreasoning and fanati—
cal exploiters of human sentiment.

These words, written by me thirty
years ago, are pertinent today. Just be-
fore the 88th Congress adjourned,
Representative Paul Rogers of Florida
introduced a bill on behalf of the
American Humane Association. The
chief element of the Rogers bill is
promulgation of standards for the
humane care, handling, and treatment
of laboratory animals. The Depart-
ment of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare is authorized to administer pro-
grams designed to advance laboratory
animal care. The bill provides inspec-
tion of laboratories and establishes an
advisory committee of which at least
three of 13 members would be from
the organized humane movement.

Ten bills designed for similar pur-
poses have been introduced previous-
ly. Five of these were essentially re-
strictive and punitive in nature. Two
placed the burden on the Surgeon
General of the United States to regu—
late the use of laboratory animals.

The National Society for Medical
Research, which represents 672 medi-
cal and related organizations, opposes
the passage of these bills, and of the
Rogers bill. The society is convinced
that certiﬁcation of animal laborato-
ries by professional medical, veteri-
nary, or biological societies will be the

most certain approach to prevent the
willful lack of humanitarianism in
animal research. All of the states have
statutes prohibiting cruelty to animals.
These statutes govern medical scien-
tists as well as other citizens.

Debt Owed to Experimentation

Establishing additional controls,
regardless of the type, will mean the
need for more funds for training per-
sonnel, for constructing animal quar-
ters, and for administration. More of
the scientist’s time will be devoted to
receiving and entertaining inspectors.

The serums, vaccines, and anti-
toxins used in medicine today, the
powerful drugs that alleviate and cure
disease, all demanded animal experi—
mentation for development and stand-
ardization. Without such experimen-
tation, the causes, methods of trans-
mission, or prevention of infantile
paralysis, epidemic encephalitis, ty—
phoid, diphtheria, smallpox, scarlet
fever, yellow fever, and meningitis
might never have been found or per—
haps would have been long delayed.

Without animal experimentation,
insulin certainly would not have been
developed. Without animal experi-
mentation, the marvels of modern sur-
gery, including suturing of tissues,
anesthesia, and organ transplantation,
could never have been achieved.

The coming year is likely to see a
more elaborate, more expensive, and
more determined campaign for puni-
tive and restrictive legislation against
animal experimentation than ever be-
fore. The public should be alerted to
the dangers in this type of legislation.
As every physician knows, experimen—
tation is the hope of the future for the
safety and progress of mankind.

OBITUARIES

Dr. Frederick A. CoIIer, 77, one of the
great international ﬁgures in surgery, re-
peatedly honored in the US. and abroad;
November 5, at Ann Arbor, Mich. Dr.
Coller was a former president of the
American Surgical Association and the
American College of Surgeons and an
honorary fellow of the Royal College of
Surgeons in Britain. In 1961, the Annals
of Surgery published a 352-page Fred—
erick A. Coller commemorative issue.
Seven years earlier the Frederick A. Col-
ler Surgical Society had been organized
by his former students, who now include
1 1 heads of medical school departments,
46 professors of surgery, and scores of
practicing surgeons. His associates agree
that it was as a teacher and trainer of
young surgeons that Dr. Coller made his
greatest contribution to medicine.

Dr. Ho-Ching Yang, 64, a rare combina-
tion of physician and stock broker; No—
vember 17, in New York City. Dr. Yang

”DOG NAPPEBS”

It cane to our attention recently that there exists
in our countryoo.another new breed of thief called the
“Dognapner: This modern~day inhumane character has a
cohort who has made a business of buying any and all
animals from the vnappers9 0....with no questions asked....
then diSDOanW of these animals to medical centers for the
purpose of viyisection or medical research.

The puruose of this editorial is not to take a stand
either pro or con on the subject of vivisectionoo...but
rather to denounce the nation°s dog and animal nappers.u.
and their cohortso..the unscrupulous, inhumane dealers
in stolen pets who often starve and freeze these stolen
pets in filthy animal concentration camps.

In i s February nth, edition, Life Magazine told a
picture story which no doubt enraged animal lovers throughm
out the country.

The article pictured an unbelievable story of one
inhumane character who had purchased for re~sale, some 104
dogs, plus countless cats, pigeons and other animals. The
smaller animals were stuffed in filthy coops and Cages like
sardines in a can and the dogs were chained to,or locked in
boxes in a huge back yard cluttered with rusting junk cars,
piles of old timbere.o a site comparable to the worst slum

area in the country.

Scattered throughout the yard and in the freezing
temperatures were piles of entrails...the only food the
halfmstarved creatures were given.

But the grisly evidence uncovered by the Haryland
State Police and the Humane Society was but a snail part
of the story. Inside some of the wooden boxess agents
found emaciated dogs~~reduced to skin and bones.....
nearly starved to death and ridden with disease...the most
pathetic, horrible sight....impossible to believe. And
in one box officers who had pets of their own9 swore among
themselves in personal outrage when they discovered what was
once a e”m—9 beautiful hound dog frozen to death.

The veterinarian who accompanied the officers was
infuriated.

”he scene was one of scrawny and sick dogs, most
barely able to move because of hunger...clawing and chewing
at the piles of frozen entrails...another dog licking des~
perately at a dirty dish of water frozen solid.

The 71 year old dog dealer was charged on 29 counts

q
x

for the nuncer of animals rescued and taken to shelters.

But left behind were 75 other dogs...at the mercy of the

dealer and the elements.

0

Congress has 0 bills pending, anyone of which would cut—
law such shameful conditions. In the meantime9 we feel Humane
Societies must continue their unrelenting war on the dog deal~
ers of the country. And it behooves every petaloving citizen
to evidence a keen interest in the matter...because he may be

the next to fall victim to the lucrative and unsavory business.

A fairly large -- but little known -- business that flourishes in the
United States is the collection and sale of animals for medical research
experiments. Nearly two million dogs and more than a half-million cats
brought in an estimated $50 million for the dealers who collected and
sold them last year.

What is disturbing is that all too often this is also a dirty business.
Many of the animals used in medical research are severely mistreated;
many of these animals are stolen pets. In fact, the Humane Society of
the United States tells us that more than 50 per cent of the 1,400,000
pets which disappear each year are stolen and eventually find their
way into the hands of these dealers.

While medical research experiments with animals are necessary, the theft
and mistreatment of the animals is not. The Humane Society has documented
countless cases where animals have been cooped up in filthy pens and
crates, denied food and water and room in which to exercise.

For years, efforts to impose any sort of regulation on laboratories or
dealers have been vigorously resisted; resisted on the grounds that such
regulations would stifle research by involving laboratories in masses of
red tape. Well, we don't think this is the case at all.

At present, eight bills are before the Congress which seek to regulate
this often sordid traffic in animals. One of these bills was introduced
by Representative Joseph Resnick of New York, and in our opinion it's a
sensible proposal. Representative Resnick's bill would authorize the
Secretary of Agriculture to regulate the handling of dogs and cats to be
used in research. It would provide for the licensing of dealers, would
outlaw the sale of dogs and cats at auction, and would make the theft of
a dog or cat a federal offense.

It's hard for us to believe that medical research would be hampered if
the traffic in stolen pets was eliminated, or if dealers were required
to handle animals decently. The existing situation is offensive to many
Americans. It needs to be changed.

Humane Legislatiog/
To the Editor of The Heral .

I want to congratulate you on
your excellent editorial of Aug.
26 re the laboratory animal
procurement bill recently en-
acted into law.

You made two very ﬁnportant
points:

First, that “Congress’ passage
of the new laboratory animal
bill was an example of the kind
of political statesmanship which '_
one hopes will ever prevail,” .
and

Secc'md, that'it is to be hoped ‘
that the research community .
and those concerned with the '
moral issue inviﬂved in needless
and unproductive suffering “will 3
now settle their differences and.
help frame sensibly ﬂexible rules .'
to promote legitimate research
while m e e tin g humane
standards.”

The Herald’s enlightened at-‘
titude is indeed an example of
the kind of editorial leadership
which we also hape “will ever
prevail.”

Q.——Dear Alice: Why does Figtree, our cat, whip his ‘

‘ tail back and forth when he gets angry at us?

A.—Figtree, like all kitty-Rats, shows his annoyance or
pleasuregthrough the movement of his tail. If he holds it
out s‘tifﬂy, he’s in the mood to attack the family mouse.

~ ; - Held vertically in the air, with a crook at the. tip he’s sig-

A.'--It demands knowledge,- patience and time. You’d
be surprised at the hundreds of pitiful creatures that
have died in tanks through neglect, or when people just
tired of them. Fish must have the right kind of water. Use
lukewarmfor tropical aquaria. Get a low, wide aquarium.
It must stand as level as possible and have a soft under-
. lay of felt. Never, never put it ,‘on the same table as a TV

 

set; the sound waves cause the container to vibrate and '
possibly burst. Use gravel or sand in your tank, and

 

 

plants. Wash gravel and sand. Don’t let your gravel Swirl
into the -,water.~ Never use limestone, however beautiful.
; The high. lime content hardens the water, which is bad

i for fish. IgneOus rock is perfect. I’d visit a regular tropical
. fish store, too.

On August 24, President Johnson signed into law a bill
to curb pet-naping. lt pro ides for humane treatment of
dogs, cats and otl r aﬁima s intended for medical research
as well as more extensive controls over the sale of dogs
and cats for research.

Under the law, all dealers must be licensed by the
Secretary of Agriculture, and research facilities may purl!
chase dogs and cats only from licensed dealers. The Se‘c’J
retary is also authorized to register research facilities
and set requirements for the sale, transportation and care
of dogs and cats. , ~ It

While this new law does notgoasfar as the bill I intrdu

on the atrocitiesof petnapers.

Here is the story we ran on animal care. I hope you
find it interesting. It was my intent to present, in the

Space allotted, what appears to be the most rational of
opposing views.

Thank you for being so generous with your time. The
interview was not only instructive but pleasant as well.

Dear Christine,

Just a note to enclose this
shocking item about dog thieves using
a fake SPCA truck. I thought you would
be interested. If there are any other
develOpments I will send them on to
you.

Eleanor Just returned from
a three week trip to South America. She
is fine and in good health.

We have a second rate movie
actor as governor now. It will be
interesting, from a newspaper point of
View to watch the show, but I'm not
very hopeful about the effect it will
have on the state.

My best regards to Roger.

Dear Mr. Lichello:

Thank you very much for returning the three photographs
of dogs at the University of Minnesota Medical School.

Noting that they were marked for cropping, I wonder
whether they were used?

We would be much interested in seeing the issue of Egg
National Graphic in which they appeared, if they did.

Sincerely,

Dear Ergo Bradbury,

I'm dmlightad to hear about your plans for an articla on animal legiﬁlation

The Smciety for Animal lrotactiva legislation was faundad in 1955, when it
bacame clear that an animal protective group that could work antiraly for needad
legislation was assantial if federal humana alaughtar legiﬁlation wag to be an-
acted. Thare is no othur similar greup in the ﬁnitwd ﬁtatass nor, $0 mar Ragw-
lodge, in the worlﬂ. Tbs dociaty 15 ragisteraﬂ with tha Federal Gavarnmwnt to
lobby. That is the raason why (althcugh it i3 3 charitabla,‘non~profit mrganizau
tion) contributionﬁ t9 it ara nut daductiblm in camputing inCQMﬁ tax. 3106a we'
do not have a tax daﬁuctibla statua, we naed hava ma faar of loaing it and ﬁhua
can press on however har& tha battle may be. As yam may know, the lQW‘raadg that

Dear Mrs St sen.

Recentl I was asked to do an aHrt Lcl e for a oje ccted magazine to be
’ "‘ ~ I 1 p '1

called 'An1mal Worlo,’ ano I have agreed to do a pi see on anszal

legislation, to run about 3,000 words.

I have quite a lot of material in my flees, but there are ga.ps. I
would appreciate all you can send me on your organization, when it
began, etc. If there are any other similar organizations in the

U.S. I would like to know about them. I d like any material on
the major accomplishments of legislation pats ed also on projected
legislation which has been defeated.

In other words, I‘ll be happy to get all you can send me. I have
a feeling jou will approve this project as i.t should add to the
Society's supporter and faithful letter writers, like myself.

Bettina Peterson, my editor at Ives, Washburn requested the article,

for a blind friend of hers who will edit the magazine. So I know
the project is a serious, thoughtful one.

Yours sincerely,

It was gaod ta saw that yen are ccnstantly puahing for the Clark~C1sveland
bill {hr humane treatment cf experimental animals and that the washgnggon
Pgst editorial was reprintad in the January first Fresno Egg. Dr. Shannon,
I am sorry to say, is now apparently'pushing a mystmm of “accreditation” by
a group whoae awn labnratories, in numarous instancas, are in desperate need
of reform.

We’ra just itsuing a circular lattarwhiéh ttlls a bit about this; and I

enclose a carbmn for yaur information, for I felt ynu'd want to know abaut
what‘g 1n the.air (and being promoted with graat zeal in order to block

the Clark~¢leva1and bill). It wculd.be a $orry day if, with the great
public demand that new axists far affaativs legislation, such a whitewash
ghould succaed. An amusing ﬁide light is that when the accreditation ays~
tam was baing pushad at a msating at the huge Hoffman Laroche pharmaceuti~
cal plant last wtek, tho spokesman twice repeatad, ”This 13 not a whitawash,"
though no one had said that it was!

Ltt me know if you want mart details.

Will you be in Washington any timﬁ? Ba aura to call Roger and me if you

I am so glad Vou will come. it is most difficult to

minutes ago. he said that he would be happy to take us both
through his establishment. but he said he'd like to have
Vou make vour request to him in nerson.

I W31] be most hannV to meet Von at the A rnort and

make arrangements if you wish. I'll leave the scheduling of meetings xnmx

to you.
Enclosed is s copy of my letter to Dr. Leash.
What time could I expect to gen finish at the Western Reserve Kennel

Dear Dr. Leash,

I was glad to hear from Mr. iiddle, who wrote inviting me to spesk at

. - Satisfactory Compromise
MAY 1 6 1955 @1115 V- . . - .

, The bill banning petnapmg passed by the House

. -v of Representative seems to us tobe a good compromise
between two widely divergent, but legitimate ohjec-'
tives. By reuniring the licensing or, and keeping of ,

. adequate records by, both dealers and laboratories.
' the bill is a good guarantee to the pet owner that
his animal will not be stolen 'for experimentationﬁ
And because its restrictions/are moderate and limited
to only the typical pet anim'al.§—-—-dpgs and catswthe
measure satisfies scientists that their legitimate scien- '
tific experiments will not bburdened by unwieldly
regulation.

‘ That the'bill finally approved was moderate in 1‘
tone is a credit to the good sense of House members.
From the beginning of debate, this measure was mark- it

3 . ed by unusaul emotional fervor generated in large part
by some people of very extreme views. (One cengress-
man said. he got more mail about this issue than about
the; whole Viet Nam war). Fortunately," neither ex-vf

”creme-opinion was released in the approved resolu-i
tion. ' ' -

On theone side. were those favoring no regulation
at all. Apparently this group did not visualize the ser-
iousness of the situationmthe unvarnished cruelty to
aiiimals—o—which has been plainly exposed by recent
i articles in newspapers andnational magazines. Inter-
I state trafficking in animals, stolen and' strayed, has

increased alarmingly in the last few years. And the

loss of these prized pets, coupled with the inhumane.

treatment at the'hands of dealers interested only in .
turning the fast buck, plainly required national remedwi
,3 ,ial action. ' , .. ., I i
1 , .

l

. .At4 the other extreme were-“adherents to thez'i
rather incredible View that absolutely no experiments":i
' "on animals should be permitted. .(Some 'of thesei
“ people flew under the banner of being “anti-vi‘viseC- i
tionists,”;despite the fast that this reputable organ--=E
ization mainly seeks "only the humane treatment of
animals subjected to scientific experiment, and not,
‘an outright ban on animal use at all.)

i
l
I
l
l
i

It was fortunate that this group, which would
halt any type of legitimate scientific injuiry, ever got
involved in the measure. Their implicit assumption
that science should Confine itself to experimentation
, on human beings, and not'resort to animals until all"
‘ of us humans were used up, probably did more to hurt ,
9‘ the cause of humane treatment than help it.

i
,.
l
l

All in all. the House has passed a good hill. The 3
{Senate shouldrapporve it as written and it should then i

By Congressional Quarterly

Washington, July -- The animal welfare movement of the United States has
split wide open over a provision of the ”antidognapping” bill, which is now being
put in final form by a House-Senate conference committee.

The provision was sponsored by Sen. A.S. Mike Monroney (D Okla.) and included
in the Senate version of the measure. It permits the Secretary of Agriculture to
move into research laboratories to prevent neglect and mistreatment of laboratory
animals while they are being held by the laboratories before and after experi—
mentation. It does not allow the Secretary to interfere with the actual conduct
of research or to impose any conditions for the handling of animals during actual
research.

Some of the animal welfare groups, led by the Humane Society of the United
States and including the American Humane Assn., the two biggest organizations, favor
dropping the laboratory care provision altogether. They believe it is too weak,
and they fear that its enactment would take the steam out of a long—term drive for
much stronger legislation on humane treatment of laboratory animals.

The stronger legislation, which the humane organizations have been pushing
for six years with relatively little success, would permit the Government to
require the maximum possible humane treatment of laboratory animals during the
actual conduct of research itself. This stronger legislation is fiercely op-
posed by nearly the entire biomedical research community and the National In-
stitutes of Health, the major federal research agency, for fear it would hamper

medical research and even possibly lead to antivivisectionist measures later on.

Amendment Support

A second faction of the animal welfare movement, led by Mrs. Christine
Stevens (the wife of Roger Stevens, who is chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center
for the Performing Arts and the President's adviser on the arts) has been fight—
ing in favor of the Monroney amendment. Mrs. Stevens heads the Society for
Animal Protective Legislation and the Animal Welfare Institute. The groups

supporting her include the Virginia Federation of Humane Societies, the Massa-

chusetts Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and WARDS (Welfare of

'Dognapping - 2 7/22/66

Animals Used for Research in Drugs and Surgery), whose chairman is the wife of Sen.
Monroney.

Mrs. Stevens argues that the publicity over the past year on the kidnapping of
pets for sale to medical research institutions has given the animal welfare move-
ment an unprecedented opportunity to pass an ”antidognapping” measure. Why not
include some provisions on humane treatment in laboratories now, she says, while
continuing to work for later passage of stronger legislation. She does not believe
retention of the Monroney amendment would harm the chances of future legislation.

In recent weeks, the two different factions of the animal welfare movement
have been conducting strong letter—writing campaigns over the issue of whether
to adopt the Monroney amendment. The House Agriculture Committee said it had
been receiving hundreds of letters a day urging the Committee to kill the Monroney
amendment when the bill went to conference. Letters in favor of retaining the
Monroney amendment have been received also.

A few of the animal welfare organizations favor killing the entire bill as too
weak -- not only the provisions on care in laboratories but also the basic "anti-
dognapping” provisions. The National Catholic Society for Animal Welfare, for
example, July 10 staged an 80-woman picketing demonstration at the White House,
asking the President to veto the bill when it finally reached him because both

the House and Senate versions were far too weak.

Background of Drive

 

From the beginning, the ”antidognapping” measure has been one of the most
massively lobbied bills in recent years. The campaign for an ”antidognapping”
measure was kicked off in mid-1965 by Rep. Joseph Y. Resnick (D N.Y.) as a
result of a case involving alleged theft of a family pet for sale to a hospital
in the Bronx for research purposes.

The case was given wide publicity by Resnick, Sens. Joseph S. Clark (D Pa.)
and other members of Congress, as well as by many newspapers. Humane societies
and animal welfare organizations began mounting a massive letter—writing campaign
to Congress, which by mid-1966 saw over 60,000 letters sent to the House Agriculture
Committee and over 20,000 to the Senate Commerce Committee, the two groups which
handled the ”antidognapping” bills. IndividualNkmberscﬁ'Congress also received
heavy mail-—in many cases, heavier than on any other legislation.

Advocates of federal legislation to curb ”dognapping” pointed out that in
recent years there had been a tremendous growth of biomedical and drug research
where animals were used for experiments. jMuch of the research was conducted or
financed by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare's National Institutes

of Health. The most conservative sources estimated that there were at least 50

to 60 million animals used for research annually, mainly rats and mice, but also
guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, monkeys and perhaps as many as 2 million dogs and
cats.

Most of the rats and mice are specifically bred for research purposes, but the
dogs and cats are usually purchased by the research institutions from animal dealers
or city pounds, often bringing up to $30 each for larger dogs.

Humane organizations charge that crooks and unscrupulous individuals, seeking
to turn a fast buck, go around stealing dogs and cats from the streets and back-
yards for sale through animal dealers to research institutions. They also charge,
and demonstrated in a widely publicized series of raids on animal dealers, that
conditions at animal dealers holding dogs and cats for sale to laboratories are
sometimes extremely inhumane--involving starvation, overcrowding, lack of water,

poor sanitation and excessive physical restraint of the animal in tiny cages.

Congressional Action

 

As a result of the charges and publicity, the House and Senate both passed
”antidognapping” measures early in l966 that would empower the Secretary of
Agriculture, through a system of licensing, to combat the theft of animals for
sale to laboratories and to require animal dealers to observe humane practices
with regard to food, sanitation and housing in the handling, transportation and
sale of research animals. The House version applied only to dogs and cats, while
the Senate version applied to some other animals as well.

Virtually the entire humane movement agreed on these provisions. But Sen.
Monroney's proposal to let the Secretary of Agriculture require humane care of
animals which were already in research institutions brought the tremendous split
in the animal welfare movement.

Humane organizations are not the only ones vitally concerned with the bill.
The National Institutes of Health and the national biomedical research community,
whose spokesman is the National Society for Medical Research, deeply feared the
Monroney provision, or any provision that would impose controls on the use or
handling of animals by research institutions.

The two at first worked strenuously to defeat the Monroney amendment in the
Senate Commerce Committee. However, after the Committee had watered down the
Monroney provision by allowing research institutions themselves to determine when
animals are being used for the actual conduct of research-~and therefore are exempt
from the Secretary of Agriculture's regulation-—the National Institutes of Health
indicated it would accept the Senate Commerce version. A spokesman said acceptance
of the revised Monroney amendment would block-~for at least five years, hopefully-—

any major public support for stronger legislation regulating the conduct of research

itself.

IESheet I On “Dognappmg

HUMANE GROUPS SPLIT ON “DOGNAPPING” BILL

The “dognapping” bill (HR 13881), which went to a
House-Senate conference July 21, produced one of the
most massive letter-writing campaigns of recent years,
stimulated by animal welfare organizations. But the bill
also caused a sharp dispute within the animal welfare
movement itself and met strong opposition on certain
provisions from the nation’s medical research community
and the Johnson Administration. (For House and Senate
floor action, see Weekly Report p. 910, 1829.)

The House version of the bill was passed April 28. It
authorized the Agriculture Department to take steps (1) to
curb the theft of dogs and cats from streets and backyards
by persons seeking to sell them for research purposes and
(2) to require humane treatment of dogs and cats by dealers
engaged in the business of selling the animals to research
institutions for experimental purposes. These provisions
were strongly supported by virtually all animal welfare
organizations. Although it took some prodding, the Ad-
ministration also backed the House version of the bill, as did
the National Society for Medical Research, spokesman for
the nation’s medical research community.

The Senate version of the bill, passed June 22, made
two major changes sponsored by Sen. A.S. Mike Monroney
(D Okla.) and pushed through the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee by him. One extended the coverage to certain re-
search animals —- guinea pigs, monkeys, rabbits and
hamsters -- in addition to cats and dogs.

The second empowered the Secretary of Agriculture
to require research institutions to observe humane condi-
tions in feeding, housing and caring for the research
animals while they were being held by the institution but
were not actually being used in the conduct of research.

It was this provision which caused the dispute within
the animal welfare movement and which aroused the con-
cern of medical research groups. The Senate language made
clear that the Secretary was not authorized to regulate the
conduct of research itself in any way or to impose any types
of limits -— humane or otherwise -- on the kinds 'of
experiments for which animals could be used or on the
conditions for the animals which existed during the conduct
of research; the Secretary’s authority was designed, to
protect the animals in laboratories against overcrowding,
poor sanitation, hunger, thirst and mistreatment only
during the periods before and after actual experimental use.
Nevertheless, the medical research community and the
National Institutes of Health (the main federal medical
research agency) deeply feared the Senate provision on re-
search institutions as a threat to freedom of research. They
feared that the provision might prove the opening wedge
for the eventual imposition of direct federal standards and
limitations on the use of animals in biomedical research and
even eventually for antivivisectionist legislation.

The research facilities provision was at first strenuously
opposed both by the Johnson Administration and the
National Society for Medical Research. However, after
certain softening amendments had been added by the
Senate Commerce Committee and when it became clear

that Monroney was going to be able to win enactment of
the provision, the Administration reluctantly accepted the
provision -- chiefly in the hope that its adoption would
cause a drop in public and Congressional interest in the
subject and thus would blunt for a number of years
attempts by animal welfare groups to obtain much stronger
legislation which would regulate the handling of animals
during the conduct of research itself.

The dispute within the animal welfare movement
turned on the question of whether it was tactically 'wise to
support the Monroney provision on research facilities
instead of working for a much stronger provision.

One faction, led by the Humane Society of the US.
and'including the American Humane Assn., favored leaving
the Monroney provision out of the “dognapping” bill.
Spokesmen argued that enactment of the provision in 1966
would blunt pUblic interest in the question of humane
treatment of animals in» laboratories and thus would slow
up the drive, which began in 1960, for legislation to re-
quire humane treatment of animals during the conduct of
research itself.

A second faction was led by Mrs. Christine Stevens,
wife of Presidential special assistant Roger Stevens and
head of the Society for Animal Protective Legislation and
the Animal Welfare Institute, and included such groups as
the Virginia Federation of Humane Societies, Massachu-
setts Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and
WARDS (Welfare of Animals Used for Research in Drugs
and Surgery), the latter headed by the wife of Sen. Mon-
roney. They strongly favored including the Monroney
amendment in the “dognapping” bill. They argued that
publicity in the past year on the kidnapping of pets for
sale to medical research institutions had given the animal
welfare movement the public support to pass a “dognap-
ping” bill and that some provisions on humane treatment
in laboratories should be included now while work con—
tinued for more comprehensive legislation later.

History of Dispute

Background. The humane (or animal welfare) move-
ment in the United States totals about 6 million persons
belonging to hundreds of different local, state, regional and
national organizations, many with overlapping member-
ships and loose affiliations with each other. Among the
largest and most active groups are the Humane Society of
the U.S., with a mailing list of 60,000 persons plus five
state branches and 30 affiliated groups, and the American
Humane Assn. Also of substantial size was Mrs. Stevens’
Animal Welfare Institute, with a mailing list of about
16,000. Mrs. Stevens said that in the mid-19505 she and
a few others set up the Society for Animal Protective Leg-
islation as a lobbying organization for animal welfare causes,
without any mass membership but with a substantial
mailing list.

In 1960, the Society for Animal Protective Legislation
sponsored a bill (S 3570), introduced by Sen. Joseph S.
Clark (D Pa.) and others, to require humane treatment of

“Dognapping” - 2

animals during the conduct of research. In subsequent
years, the Society supported and worked for similar legis-
lation, and so did the Humane Society of the US. The
latest such bills were S 1071, introduced in 1965 by Sen.
Clark and backed by the Society for Animal Protective
Legislation; and S 2576, introduced in 1965 by Sen.
Thomas J. McIntyre (D NH.) and backed by the Humane
Society of the US. and the American Humane Assn.
These were not antivivisectionist measures. Rather, they
set up rules and mechanisms requiring research to be con-
ducted under conditions to reduce pain, avoid duplication
of experimentation, provide good food and clean quarters
and limit the numbers of animals used for experiments under
certain conditions. The medical and scientific community
in the United States strongly opposed all such bills, saying
that the actual provisions themselves would limit freedom
of research, require federal approval for different types of
experiments and might eventually open the door to more
drastic measures of an antivivisectionist nature that would
hamstring biomedical research. Although the various
humane organizations worked steadily over the years for
the passage of the legislation, the issue failed to catch
fire with the public. Congressional action also was blocked
by the strong opposition of the chairmen of the relevant
Congressional committees, Sen. Lister Hill (D Ala.) of the
Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee and Rep.
Oren Harris (D Ark.) of the House Interstate and Foreign
Commerce Committee.

“Dognapping” Issue. In mid-1965, as a result of an
incident involving the alleged theft of a family dog in
Pennsylvania for sale to Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx,
New York City, Rep. Joseph Y. Resnick (D N.Y.), an upstate
New York Congressman, became deeply interested in the
subject of “dognapping.” Upon investigation, Resnick
was told that millions of animals (some estimates were
as high as 300 million; estimates available to the Na—
tional Institutes of Health put the figure at perhaps 60
million) were used each year in research, the bulk of them
mice and rats, but perhaps as many as 1 million to 2 mil-
lion dogs and cats. Humane groups told Resnick that
many of these were pets stolen from backyards and streets
by unscrupulous persons and sold to animal dealers for
transmittal to research institutions. Poor sanitation, poor
food, thirst, crowding and general mistreatment were
common among dealers and in laboratories, it was said.

As a result, Resnick July 9, 1965, introduced and began
pushing a bill (HR 9748) to control thefts of dogs and cats,
to require humane treatment by animal dealers and to
require humane treatment by research institutions, though
not during the actual conduct of research but only before
and after actual experimentation was done. Sens. Clark
and Warren G. Magnuson (D Wash.), chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee, July 25, 1965, cosponsored
a similar bill (S 2322), which was referred to Magnuson’s
committee.

Unlike the broader legislation long supported by the
humane organizations, the “dognapping” issue soon took
fire and began to receive public attention. The Humane
Society of the US, expressly for the purpose of pushing the
legislation, conducted a widely publicized series of raids on
dog storage farms and dog auctions where inhumane
treatment was alleged. The Society for Animal Protective
Legislation and the Humane Society of the US. took the
lead in pushing a letter-writing campaign to Congress in
support of “dognapping” legislation. This campaign

ultimately developed into one of the heaviest mail cam-
paigns in many years. The Senate Commerce Committee
told CQ that in the year between July 1965 and July 1966,
it had received some 20,000 letters, the vast majority
favoring “dognapping” legislation; the House Agriculture
Committee, which handled the House legislation, received
60,000 letters of the same type over the same period, and
was still getting several hundred a day as conferees pre-
pared to meet. Individual members also received Very
heavy mail. Several sources said a Feb. 4, 1966, picture
article in Life magazine on “dognapping” and inhumane
treatment had given a substantial push to the “dognapping”
legislation.

House Hearings. On Sept. 2, 1965, the House Agri-
culture Livestock and Feed Grains Subcommittee held
hearings on “dognapping” bills, at which time the split
between the HUmane Society of the US and the Society
for Animal Protective Legislation on whether to include
research facilities in the bill became evident. No Ad—
ministration witness appeared. The only witness for the
National Society for Medical Research (whose 211 con-
stituent member organizations include virtually all profes-
sional medical groups, drug research laboratories, schools
of medicine, university laboratories and other elements of
the medical research community) indicated strong reser—
vations.

By early 1966, pressure and letter-writing for a
“dognapping” bill had begun to assume intense propor—
tions. The House Subcommittee March 7—8 and the Senate
Commerce Committee March 25 and 28 held hearings on
the “dognapping” legislation. The National Society for
Medical Research, in its first clear statement of position
to the committees, March 7 said (1) the bill should be
limited to theft of pets and inhumane treatment by dealers
and should not include any provisions on handling of
animals in laboratories; (2) there was no evidence of kid-
napping or mistreatment of rats, mice, guinea pigs and
animals other than dogs and cats, and therefore, such
animals should be excluded from legislation to avoid enor-
mous costs that were really unnecessary. The Society also
said that the need for any legislation regarding the treat-
ment of animals in laboratories was obviated by the creation
in 1965 of an organization called the American Assn. for
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC), es-
tablished by 16 organizations including the Society, the
American Medical Assn., the Assn. of American Medical
Colleges, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn., the
Animal Care Panel (an organization of medical and re-
search organizations plus some breeders of laboratory
animals and manufacturers of laboratory animal cages and
instruments, created in 1950 to improve laboratory animal
care) and several others. This group was prepared to
undertake a voluntary accreditation program for labora—
tories. (Humane groups ridiculed the idea of self-
regulation, saying the members of AAALAC were them-
selves the main users of laboratory animals and that it
would be another case of letting the fox guard the chicken
coop.)

The Administration sent no witnesses to these hearings.
However, in a March 7 letter to the House Agriculture
Committee, the Agriculture Department said that the
Budget Bureau did not favor enactment at that time be—
cause it was still working on its own draft proposals;
nevertheless, if a bill should be passed, it should apply only,
to dogs and cats and should not cover handling in

 




laboratories but only dealers. The House version of the
bill, passed April 28, met these two conditions.

Senate Action. The Administrations own proposal (S
8882) was finally introduced May 10 by Sen. Hill, dealing
only with conditions in laboratories. It authorized the
Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) to set
standards for the care of animals in laboratories, to be
checked on, possibly, by AAALAC; and to make grants to
cover up to two-thirds of the cost of building improved
animal care facilities in laboratories. Although the measure
had been under study for many months, most observers
told CQ that its introduction was actually probably chiefly
designed to ward off the Monroney laboratory provision,
which was then gaining strength in the Senate. Although
S 8882 did permit federal regulation of animal care in the
laboratory, spokesmen for scientific and research groups
told CQ the bill would be preferable to the Monroney
amendment because S 8882 would be administered by the
HEW Department, which would never do anything to
interfere with the conduct of research, rather than by the
Agriculture Department.

Despite introduction of S 8882, the Administration was
unable to block the Monroney amendment to HR 18881 in
the Senate Commerce Committee. James A. Shannon,
director of the National Institutes of Health, at his own
request made an emergency appearance before the Com-
mittee May 25 to oppose the Monroney amendment. He
indicated that the Administration would accept the House
version of the bill.

The Humane Society worked strongly against the
Monroney amendment, and the Society for Animal Pro-
tective Legislation worked strongly for. The Commerce
Committee June 15 adopted the Monroney amendment,

although with three important changes designed to meet
specific Administration objections: (1) the Committee
added a phrase which permitted a research institution to
be its own judge as to when an animal was being used for

“Dognapping” - 3

the actual conduct of research and therefore not subject to
regulations on housing, feeding, etc; (2) it added a phrase
which would exclude hospitals from the definition of re-
search facilities unless they purchased cats and dogs for
research (many did not); (8) it dropped licensing require-
ments for research facilities and substituted 3 simple reg-
istratiOn requirement.

With these changes, HR 18881 was passed by the
Senate June 22. The National Society for Medical Re—
search, in a June 21 newsletter, and the NIH, in private
communications to the Commerce Committee, said that the
changes made in the Monroney amendment just before
the bill' was reported had reduced the Monroney amend-
ment’s potential harmfulness sufficiently so that the Sen-
ate-passed version of the bill was not likely to harm
biomedical research throughout the nation. A NIH spokes—
man July 19 told CQ that, consequently, the NIH now
preferred the Senate version of HR 18881 to the House
version because, by covering laboratories with a provision
that was not harmful, the Monroney amendment would end
”for at least five years, we hope,” the possibility of any
stronger, more objectionable legislation. He added that the
NIH hoped, however, that the conferees would limit the
final bill to dogs and cats only (dropping other animals)
and would drop excessively strong “search and seizure"
provisions in Section 15 of the Senate version. On the other
hand, the American Medical Assn. July 19 said it still op-
posed both the House and Senate versions.

As the bill went to conference, the House Agriculture
Committee was still receiving several hundred letters a
day, mainly stimulated by the Humane Society of the
US, asking it to insist in conference on killing the
Monroney amendment lest its enactment block later strong
“conduct of research” legislation. Moreover, the National
Catholic Society for Animal Welfare July 10 picketed the
White House, aSking the President to veto HR 18881 be-
cause both House and Senate versions were 'too weak.

I would like to do anything possible
to be helpful to get the bill introduced in
the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce
Committee and discussed the matter with Walt

We do have a long standing policy
against anyone on the papers ever asking
for any Specific action from anyone except
by means of an editorial. From a practical
standpoint this may seem like an antiquated
stand but it does have many advantages in the
long run. ~

Enclosed is an editorial which I
wrote and which should appear tomorrow
or early next week. Although I do not feel
I could ask Moss directly, there would be
nothing wrong with your doing the following.

You could write to Moss, or have someone
talk to him, telling him that you wrote to
me with the request for help that you made.
You could go on to say that I expressed the
desire to help in any way possible but felt
because of the longstanding Bee policy it would
be imprOper for the Bee to ask Moss to take
this action. However in lieu of doing what you
asked we have published the enclosed editorial
which does call for some action in the House
to get the bill moving.

I hope this will be helpful although I
realize it is not as persuasive as it could
be due to its indirectness.

Your letter was a very pleasant "welcome

Greece. I hadn't heard about the great victory
until then.

You certainly are to be congratulated.
This just proves that even Congress can see

Dear Mrs. Stevens,-

I am enclosing three letters received by one of our
subscribers who wrote in support of the hvmane treatment
bills. Please don't bother to return them. A number of our
people have written to senators or congressman that I happen
to have heard about. “ V

I am so much a prisoner of the daily pressure that I
miss doing even important things, and I'm afraid I haven't
sent you clippings and notes as I have intended to do.
Cleveland Amory came over from Nantucket last summer and
had half an hour in our office, and I had a useful talk with
Dr. Gerry B. Schnelle, chief of staff of Angell Memorial
Hospital in Boston. He is quite a man, and e@.mnintimidated
who is courageously on our side.

As to the enclosed letters, I was cynically amused at
the line over the signature of Barry Goldwater.

With all “ood wishes,

YOurs sinceeely,

ANIMAL CARE ens. IMQSES ITS BITE

With most of its potential bite reduced
to a bark. an animal care bill aimed
at regulating animal dealers, but also
covering research laboratories, has
been approved by the Senate Com-
merce Committee. Sen. A. S. (Mike)
Monroney (D-Okla.) had proposed
amendments to the bill introduced in
the Senate by Sen. Warren G. Magnu-
son (D—Wash.) and already approved
by the House (MWN, April 15 ). The
amendments were bitterly opposed by
most of the scientiﬁc community be-
cause of their restrictive provisions. In
the ﬁnal version of the bill, most of the
laboratory regulation has been reduced
to near—token status.

" The hub of the controversy was

l 1 whether the Secretary of Agriculture

should have authority to license labo-

ratories and to set standards for animal

l care protection during experimenta—
\tion. The politically powerful Animal

Welfare Institute had backed Senator
Monroney in tacking on provisions
which would have established federal
licensing, registration, inspection, and
control of biomedical laboratories.
Numerous scientiﬁc groups, includ-
ing the American Association for
Cancer Research, had opposed the
amendments as “punitive and restric—
tive.” The research. groups were par-
ticularly opposed to setting up federal
care standards for laboratories with.-
out providing the necessary funds.

HEW Would Set Standards

Scientists felt that if the Senate bill
were passed with the Monroney
amendments, another bill, favored by
the Administration, would stand little
chance of passage. This bill gives the
HEW Secretary authority to set stand-
ards for the care and. housing of re-
search animals. To qualify for federal
research funds, research institutions
would have to be accredited by an
approved outside agency, probably
the new American Association for the
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Facilities. Finally, the measure would
provide funds for the construction of
animal facilities through the Health
Research Construction Act.

In the bill that was reported out by
the committee, the provisions for

MEDICAL WORLD NEWS /June 24. 1966

licensing research laboratories are
gone. However, the Secretary of Agri—
Culture, in consultation with HEW,
would still set care standards, except
during experimentation.

Also, the facilities to be covered
have been limited to only those receiv-
ing federal funds or purchasing dogs
or cats. It is estimated that coverage

has been reduced from 11,000 to
2,000 research institutions, hospitals,
and clinics. The bill further allows six.
months for compliance after the stand-
ards are established.

In its present form, with only mild
control proposed, the bill is believed
to stand a good chance of being ac—
cepted after passage by the Senate. l

RICHARD P. SANGER
EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR

Ms. Ellanor C. Donnelly
629 Lehigh Road
Newark, Delaware 19711

Dear Ms. Donnelly:

I appreciate your letter of January 21 on the
subject of legislation now pending before the Congress
relating to the humane treatment of animals and to

the theft and abuse of animals for laboratory purposes.
Our editorial board has investigated this subject,
has concluded that legislation is necessary, and is in
the process of initiating an editorial campaign. We
appreciate your calling our attention to this matter.

Since

Richard P. Sanger
