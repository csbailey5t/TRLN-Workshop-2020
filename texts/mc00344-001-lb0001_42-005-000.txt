NOT TOO MANY YEARS
A G O , infectious canine
diseases annually killed many.
many dogs. Some even
threatened humans and other
animals.

These scmirges now are
con'rollable with effective.
safe vaccines that produce
immunity in dogs. But
prevention is only as good as
i t 3 application. Canine
diseases have NOT disap
peared. They’re ready and
waiting for the unprotected
animal. And that’s for dog
gone sure!

I strongly agree with Alpo
Dog Food. in their never
ceasing concern in urging dog
owners to follow veterinary
instructions and recommenda-
tions on immunization against
the “big four” infectious
diseases: Distemper, canine
hepatitis. leptospirosis and
rabies. Alon. like this reporter.
avers frequent veterinary
chechaups. h

Three Of the aforementioned
diseases. distemper. canine
hepatitis and rabies. are
caused by Viruses. The fourth.
leptospirosis. is a bacterial
infection

Distem per and canine
hepatitis have similar symp—
toms and at one time was
confused with each other.
They are produced by dif~
f e r e n t, viruses, however.
Hepatitis attacks the dog‘s
liver; distemper his entire
system.

Neither is rontracted by
h u m a n (canine hepatitis
should never be confused with
human bepatitisi but are
highly contageous to clogs,
transmitted by an infected
animal‘s urine, stools, or other
secretions. Distemper virus
may be aireborne through a
sick dog’s breath. ‘

leptospirosis attacks the
dog’s kidneys and liver. it is
communicable to humans but
this is extremely. rare.

Although recovery from
these dreaded dis-eases is
possible. it is far from auto-
m a t i c . Moreover, serious
illness often leaves after ef-
fects. The dog may never
again have robust health.
Distemper weakens its vicv
tims. making them vulnerable
to secondary infections that
may cause death.

There are various types of
vaccines and schedules of
inoculations against the major
infectious canine diseases. As
Alpo so potently points out,
dog lovers should never
gamble with their canine
charges‘ prescious lives. Pro-
tection against rabies, dis-
temper, canine hepatitis and
leptospirosis is readilyavail-
able. No dog owner should
forget this responsibility.

BREED OF THE WEEK:
DANDIE DINMONT . . . The
term “quaint” 'and “distino
tive” come first to mind in
commenting on the Dandie
Dinmont’s appearance. His
character sets him apart from
other terrier breeds. too, for
he is an individualist, and has
much more natural dignity
and poise than the usual
aggressive terrier breeds most
times possess. \

The Dandie Dinmont Terrier
is a product of the Cheviot
Hills of Southern Scotland.

The Dandie does not need
extensive plucking and groom-
ing. A minimum of “tidying
up” with scissors and comb
keeps him looking peat. Time
consuming grooming and ex-
pensive dog beauty parlor
visits are not necessary. '

Dean Mark,

Thank you so very much for writing an you did about
the marine mammals. We're making an effort right now
to see that the Senate and House Resolutions requesting
the Secretary of State to call for a tennyear international
moratorium on the commercial killing of whales are included
on the agenda of the International Whaling Commission at
its annual meeting in London in June.

Keeping things off the agenda is one of the ways of
disposing of unpleasant questions that 1e sometimes used by
the International Whaling Commission. There is a question,
too, an to how strongly the American delegation'will defend
and fight for the concept of the moratorium, which.will be
very unpopular in some quarters.

Commet like yours is very important, and you can be
sure it is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens

This story Originally began as a

the plight of abandoned animals,

Consequently. their action contributes
to “the September problem" -—
abandoned dogs in rural and semi-rural
communities.

Although the dog belongs to the
mientific classification cam ivora, along
with predators such as lions, tigers,
Wildcats, leopards, coyotes, foxes,
wolves, skunks, weasels, minks,
badgers, and bears, he is in general the

mm of either carbon monoxide
poisoning, sodium pethathol,

Green, of the Wed Milford Board of
Health, observed that abandoned
animals canons survive once they are
returned to the wild state. He cited the
famous example of Hm, the 5mm of
Born Free fame; she had to be
carefully trained to hunt, a task that
almost proved impossible, because she
had been tamed by the Adamses. Elsa
also had to be extensively trained in the.
rudiments of survival in a place
(Africa) where animals have less to fear

from.man than they do in New Jersey.

Lmai officials are generally reluctant
to discus the issue of unwanted
animals. possibly due to the fear» of
ads erse publicity.

in Wayne. for example. one Board of
Health officer assured me that they had
no problem with unwanted animals.
The statement intrigued me con-
siderng the number of apartments
where animals are not allowed.

This oificial assured me that should
an animal be dumped in Wayne, his

this is strange in a town which has a

that many people are oblivious to. Last
spring, Gmhsman was taken to court

by The National Catholic Society forw

Animal Welfare, Inc., the Hudson
County and Cumberland County
Districts of the. New Jersey Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
and George MacDonald, A New Jersey
citizen; they charged that Grohsman’s
business was grievously mistitled “The
Humane Animal Center of New Jersey,
Inc."

The court ruled that - the word
“humane” should be deleted from the
title of Grohsman’s business. Judge
Theodore Trautwein of the Superior

‘ Court of New Jersey based his ruling

on the connotative meaning of
“humane”: Judge Trautwein stated
that an organization which employs the
word “humane" “. . . is concerned with
the care and welfare of animals, that it
will either find a new home for an
animal that is left with it or, in the
altem ative. it will‘return it to the owner
or. in the. alternative, it will ultimately.

method of euthanasia, mercy killing. if

Moreover and more importantly, any
*organization containing the word

“"Humane in its title or similar words
is an organization in“ the main that
opposes the use of animals for
laboratory experiments.” in an earlier
decision (November 1970), Gmhsman
was forced to remove the word
“shelter” from his title, as well as to
inform the public that he is indeed a
profit-making organization.

Towns such as Oakland, Franklin
Lakes. Riverdale. and Ringwood are
among over 44 area towns which
contract Grohsman to remove stra.v

animals to his compound in Lodi. If 1/

ROBERT BURNS, an eighteenth
century Scottish poet once wrote:
“Where ignorance is bliss, tis folly to be
wise." This sarcastic observation is an
easy one to adhere to,in the course of
one’s daily routine. Cruelty to children
is readily‘ rectified by concerned in-
dividuals, as indeed, it should not be
tolerated to any degree.

Cruelty to animals, a manifestation
of a diseased mind, is more readily
endured, especially in lalmratory ex~
periments which have not been
structured adequately in regard to care
(operative as well as post-operative
attention). housing. and disease
control. So often the victim of these
experiments is made to suffer undue
pain as a result of reluctamre on the
part of researchers to alleviate pain
through the. necessary pain relievers
and anesthesia

Although the New Jersey legislature

prohibits borato ' g in New Jersey
from purchasing ”318 impounded in

appropriated for research purposes are.
unprotected. Bill A4852 reads in part:
“No dog or other animal so caught and
detained or pmcured, obtained, sent or
brought to a pound or shelter shall be
sold or otherwise made available for the
purpose of experimentation." This bill
remained unsigned on Governor
Cahill's desk for unknown reasons.

In August. 1964, the United States
congress primed a bill protecting

of animals in their region. One of the
most admirable organizatkms in our

‘ EVEN AFTER careful screening,
animals are sometimes placed in a

One member spoke of'a dog (Gypsy)
who was dropped on her lawn; she had
puppies a few days later. They placed
Gypsy. as well as her puppies. They
adn'sed Gypsy s new owner to haveher
spayed. A period of time elapsed and
they again heard from Gypsy’s owner;
the dog had been allowed to roam
during her fertile period. The PCPAS
member advised the owner to get the
dog a “mismate shot," an injection that
will prevent pregnancy if administered
during the forty-eight hours after
fertilization. A number of months later,
the owner returned Gypsy who utas
once again pregnant. This time the
animal had another problem; her tail

had become gangrenous, and as a result ‘

of neglect. had to be amputated. Upon

limited to ilivenile offenders; adults are
equally culpable. But the solution to
such inhumanity, according to Mrs.
'Sonne, is through the eduCation of
children. She feels that teachers should
devote some tin]? with instructing
children in compassion and respect of
all creatures. hits. Lousie Fava,
another member, comments that
children must learn to love animals if
they are to learn to love people.
Children A who are not guided by

a destructive vein, maybe mutilating a
stray dog or cat; nnstopped or
corrected, they then continue maybe as

far as to destroy human life.
The compassionate members of
v “ society serve as a balm for the wound
' caused by inhumanity. People, such as
Mrs. Sonne, unceasingly work to

redemption are mercifully euthanized
by a reputable veterinarian, not gassed,
not chlorophormed, not shot. -

Mrs. Sonne requested that I not go

reason; she feared that this article
might give sick minds new ideas, but if
one considers the horrendous deeds '
committed against children, one can
imagine the crimes committed against
animals who can’t tell. One member,
Mrs. Steve F ava, observes that animal
work is like being on a sinking ship and
having the choice to save one person,
your mother or your father.

THE REASON for this article is
simple; it is to alert you to the problem
of maltreated animals, whether it be by

Dear Dr. Gibson,

Thanks for your letter offering to help advance the
welfare of animals through the writing of articles. There is
need for many articles in many different fields, and I would
especially suggest that with your M.e. in Education, articles
for educational journals opposing experiments by high school
students which cause pain or distress to animalS'would be of
great value.

Enclosed are reprints of articles which we have written
for such publications together with some beckgrOund information
which.might be useful for you, WOuld you let me know whether
this subject is one Which you feel you would like to write about?

' Articles are needed_with.respect to ocean mammals, oopeoially
whales and dolphins. I am not euro where such articles could best
be placed, but I am sending background material on this under
separate cover.

You may also wish to obtain a copy of Animals and Their Legal
Rights, and I enclose an order blank. Let me know I? you Wis. to
have a copy sent.

we certainlyaappreciate your interest and willingness to
work on articles. A tremendous amount can be accomplished this
way, add I look forward to corresponding with you further about it.

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens
President

P.S. I suggest you write me at my home to avoid delay. My home

Mr.‘Wentworth, ~2- 11/5/71

.Miespelling of the names of authors of beaks referred to gives
the reader an uneasy feeling that a massive Job of rechecking would
be called for if any complete critique were to be undertaken. For
example Hediger, the international authority on captive aphasia, is
repeatedly spelled "Hedicker.“ Burch, co-author of, ”The Principles
of Humane Experimental Technique" is referred to as "Birch,“ in the
body of the text, though not in a footnote. ‘

Although the foreword (page 1) suggests that passage of theLabora~
tory Animal Welfare Act, P.L. 9-5h4, in 1966 is the reason that the
author undertook the writing of the book, Chapter 12, “Research.Animals
and the Law” is badly out of date in numerous respects. For example,
on page 165, the author states, "While the scientific community is
satisfied with the 1966 Federal Laboratory Animal welfare act, it is
fearful that additional and more restrictive legislation will be passed,"
and on the two following pages he lists points which give ”cause for
concern". The last reads as follows: “(6) provide that the not apply
to all warmblooded animals used in research and not just to the six
categories named.at the time the legislation was adopted." This very
provision waa'included in the amendments to the Laboratory Animal Welfare
Act, known as the Animal Welfare Act of 1970, which was signed by
President Nixon, December BA, 1970 and which.will go into effect one
year from the date of signature. Provision for “appropriate use of
anesthetic, analgesic and tranquilising drugs” is also included in the
extensive amendments to the Act. ‘Point (2) page 166, refers_to a
provision in this area. Evidently unconscious of passage of the Animal
Welfare Act of 1970, the author ends the chapter with.a statement that-
”the full.range of political gamesmanship will be played in trying to ,
procure and in trying to prevent the procurement of additional legislao
ton. ' i ‘

Equallylndicrous are the references to a.model state law of which
tue author states (p. 1&8), ”. . . the draft thus far available has not
satisfied enough organizations and individuals to secure acceptance“.
The final draft was approved by the United States Animal Health.Aesc-
ciation (USAHA) at its annual convention, October, 1969, and by the
Council of State Governments in May, 1970.

I aa.a member of the'USAHA’s committee on animal welfare and can
testify that none of the several drafts discussed by the committee ever
"singled out research institutes" as claimed by the author (p. 1&9).

If, in looking over pages 1&8 and 9 in reference to these comments
you are confused by the author's use of the name “United States Live~
stock Sanitary Association" in connection with the model state law,
this was the former name of the United States Animal Health.Associstion

D ear Ms . Stevens:

I am sending the manuscript about which I wrote you
last month, LEGAL RIGHTS AND RESTRAINTS IN MAN'S
TREATMENT OF ANIMALS, by H. W. Hannah. Since you
indicated you would be going on a trip toward the end of September
and we didn't get your letter until September 28, I held off on
sending it. However, I put through a call to your office on
Thursday, and your secretary indicated you would be back the week
of the 18th.

As I mentioned earlier, what we are seeking is a critique
which will tell us and our press board whether or not the manuscript
merits publication. It is, quite frankly, poorly written and the
organization often leaves much to be desired. It would obviously
take a good deal of work to put this into shape for publication. My
question to you, then, and to your associate with the Animal
Welfare Institute (if you are able to get him to look at it) is simply
whether the material is of sufficient importance to justify the time
and effort. Is the content sufficiently new and important? Is the
information for the most part accurate, to you knowledge? Does he
cover most areas that should be considered in a book of this kind?
Are there serious gaps?

It would be helpful if you would tell me something about your
qualifications when you send your comments -- is your background
generally in law or veterinary medicine? We will also need your
social security number in order to pay an honorarium. If you have

Since your mention in your letter to me to the Animal
Welfare Institute that you went a copy of the December 1970
low, I em enclosing e copy of PL 91-579. This is an amend-
ment to PL 89~5uh and must be read in con unction with it.

I believe you already have a copy o?"snimals ena Their Le a1

end 0‘ the Chapter on laboratory animals in that book.

Also enclosed is a copy of my recent testimony on the
ocean mammals bills. You will find material relating to the
wearing of furs in this testimony which.mey be helpful to
you in connection with your articles. I regret that I so
not able to send you glossy prints of furbeerers in traps,
but suggest you write to Defenders of‘Wildlife who can pro-
bably supply them. ‘

Dear Miss @tevens:

I mote you May 14, and never got an answer. Suppose you
are busy. I would like my Cat Fancy article back, if
you can. I have run out of copies. I am getting letters
from all over, as it just hits the stands.

 

I am still concerned about the Model Law, as I wrote

May 14. Though it starts out about cats and dogs, it

ends up again and again sayingwhat a dog warden can

and cannot do with and to dogs. Not a word about

what he may do to cats. Your 19th Annual Report on

summary says in items one and two that the law is

to establish standards for dogs and regular dog dealers and
dogs wardens.

In view of your literature being so good, I have added

you to my will. However, if this overwhelming interest

in dogs and downplaying of cats goes on, I get disillusioned.
One of the problems with all such grups is that our

efforts are shattered into many organizations. So no one
group has too much power and influence. One reason

is that cat :dovers take off into their own groups,

as Pet Pride and Ntl. Cat Protection, etc. The anti-
vivisectionists refuse to support you, wanting to end

all labwork; I am monapractical; there will be lab work

and I prefer to join you in bettering sonditions. The
lovers of wild creatures fracture into Defenders of Wildlife
who don't support hunting and Ntl. Wildlife which does.

And so on.

A nearby dog warden told me that stricter laws on dogs
left him free to use cats for his extra income. That is
why I think that model law is not model. It should state
dogs and cats always, every section. So no smart lawyer

can get them off saying: it only says here dog wardens
canot do so and so to dogs.

I am referring letter writer to you,suggesting they join.
I am also starting a cat column, in which I hepe to
support you.

Yours~tru y.

Dear Professor Atkins,

In response to your letter of march.10th, the materials
you requewted were sent to you, and I trust they reached you
safely.

I am glad to hear that you have written an article,
"Cats and the.Laboratory" for Cat Fancy magazine, and I would
be very much interested in reading your article if you should
have a reprint or other copy available, as I do not aubscribe
to the magazine.

In answer to your comment about the Medal State Law, it
definitely does include cats, not just dogs. In fact, the first
sentence in Section 1, Purpose, states “to protect the owners
of dogs and cats from the theft of such.pets." For your informa~
tion, I am enclosing a copy of the proposal.

Looking forward to reading your article, I am

Sincerely,

'Dear Miss Coegrove,

I was glad to hear ebeut the books you are
writing, and I hope you will let us know the exact

Thank you for your kind words abeut our work.
I believe there is beginning t0 be a greater acceptance
and support for work to protect eﬁimele, so it is well
worthwhile to be persistent.

Dear Mr. Unaworth,

Thank you for your letter of Auguet 20th. The Society for
Animal Proteetiye Legislation worked hard to obtain passage of the
Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, P. L. 89-514.}; which paeeed in 1966 and
then for passage of the Animal welfare Act of 1970, P.L. 91*579.
The new law in an amendment to the previous one strengthening it in
a number or important ways.

For your information, I am enclosing a leaflet prepared by the
11.8.- Department of Agriculture telling pet owners ways in which they
can protect their pet from being stolen, and telling them. about the
Laboratory Animal Welfare; Act as it affects pet owners.

The Animal Welfare Act of 1970 (not covered in the pamphlet
becauee it had not bee: panned when the pamphlet was prepared) will go
into effect December 21;, 1970, when inoreaeed coverage will include all
warmublooded animals specified by the Secretary of Agriculture whether
they be in zoos, circueee, menageries, the wholesale pet trade, in
laboratoriee throughout their entire stay there, and (because of a
broadening of the interstate comer-ca clause) an increaeed number of
dealers in doge and oats for use in research laboratories.

The Society Mr Animal Protective Legislation also eupporta
the Model state Law approved last year by the Council of State Govern-
manta which complements theee federal laws. Enclosed is a copy or the
model law with relevant eeotione marked for your information.

Dishonest, unsupervised dog wardens constitute, in our opinion,
the single gretteet canoe or pet theft. A warden can pick up a dog
in broad daylight and may often dispose of the dog at he pleases. Dog
control in many parts of the country is poorly supervised or not super-
. vised at all. It is con-em for the warden to put dogs he picked up
in some dirty little shed where they receive little or no care. News
stories about such mistreatment and about the inability of people to
retrieve their doge come aoroee my deek frequently.

. As you no doubt have found, opinione on the extent or pet
theft vary widely. no hard figures exist, and I doubt it they ever will.
However, in the interest of accuracy it will be important for you to
recognize the change in the situation since enactment of the Laboratory
Animal Welfare Act in 1966.31nee that time 115 deg dealers have gone
out of bueineee because they could not or would not meet the standards

Mr. Gerald Carson
Carson Road
Millerton, New York 125ue

Deer me. Carson,

Thanks for your kind words. I think it would be
fair to say that the National Wildlife Federation is a
hunteruoriented conservation organization. Hunters do
do a lot of conservation work, so if you designate it as
a front for gunners you would want to be sure that the
rest of the information you give doesn't leave the 1m»
preeeion that it doesn’t work on such things as preserving
habitat for animals, for example.

The Wcrld Wildlife Fund receives gifts from wealthy
hunters, and some of its main sponsors are hunters. I have
naver heard that the American Forestry Association is closely
associated with hunters. It wee rather surprising to see
that it joined in oppoSition to the Ocean Mammals Bill with
the National Wildlife Federation, the World Wildlife Funds,
and other groups that support thezmanagement concept as
against the preservation concept. The hearings combng up
September linth or tenth on this will be interesting.

I'm sorry to hear that your article on rodeos is not
to appear as soon as you had expected. ‘

With kind regards,

Sincerely;

, Christine Stevens

"Dear Miss Sullivan,‘

. Thank you for your letter. We are very glad to know that you
are writing about the important subject of preventing the births of
unwanted puppies and kittens, for so much.suf£ernng'resutts when
there are homeless animals. ' '

You will find much.of interest in the recent cover story by
Ann Cottrell Free for the washin tonian (April, 1971) and if a re~
print is available soon,I will enclose one with this letter. 'The
article goes into the decompression chamber as well as the pet popu—
lation problem and shows that it is not a chamber which should be
used for killing the anhmals Which are brought to pounds and shelters.

The chief reason why it should not be used for this purpose is
because many of these animals are suffering from distemper or other
upperrespiratory disease which causes blockage of the eustachian
tubes so they cannot-clear their ears. This can cause great pain
from the explosive decompression before the animal loses conscious“
ness. -Also, very young animals do not subcumb easily to decompression
because they can get along with much less oxygen than adult animals.
Thus, these small creatures sometimes have to be decompressed repeatede
1y before they are actually dead. Enclosed is some additional material
on this. ' -

I have no statistics on the use of the decompression chamber and
do not know how widely it is used, but I do know that it is constantly
promoted by the manufacturers. Also, a few years ago, all the Canadian
humane organizations.that had purchased the Euthanair junked thtbr
machines because the considered them inhhmane.

. Turning to methods of preventing births, the Animal Welfare In»
stitute has sought to encourage scientific work leading to effective
means of bibhh control, but, so far, there has not been sufficient-
work done to provide a method which can be substituted for surgical
neutering. The G.D. Searle Company of Skokie, Illinois has developed
a chemosteritlnt for the control of pigeon populations. The Upjohn
Company of Kalamazoo, Michigan has been working in this field for dogs
:and cats. The Veterinary College at Fort Collins, Colorado is doing
nesearch in this field. I would suggest that you write to all for in-
/ormation, indicating that you are writing an article for publication
n a national magazine on the subject. It is particularly important

hat the pharmaceutical houses recoanize that there would be a_suh-

7- u; .

 




Miss Sullivan . ~2- . ‘ 3/29/71

etential market fer such a product, and articles on the Subject will
helptto bring this home.

In answer to your other questione, I believe Loe Angelee is the
first city to open a clinic to spay animals. At the present time I
know of no other such clinic or legislation.

With regard to vasectomy end castration, I believe epeying ie
the primary goal for surgical neutering since a single male dog or
eat left in an area where other males have been neutered can father
many litters. A female, once spayed, cannot produce young; thus,
the emphasis should be on the female animals, eepeo ially when avail-
able funds for neutering are so inadequate. .

I hepe you will let us know when your article is completed so we
can be alert for its publication.

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens‘

Dear Miss Bemelmans,

The Society's danuary 30 letter
arrived this morning just as I was looking over my
research on conservation in Alaska. I am writing
a book, to be published this fall, on Alaska with
emphasis on the discovery of oil on the North Slope
and its meaning to several different areas,
including ecology.

Alaskans try to give me the
impression that they are a most conservation-
minded peOple. It is my impression that Alaska
law prohibits shooting animals from planes;
indeed, I have been told that it is illegal
to shoot game the same day the hunter is flown
in to the area. The Polar bear is definitely
excluded from this protection, I have been told,
but this is the only exclusion.

It occurred to me while
reading your letter that i really don't have
positive information on Alaska hunting
regulations, whether on state or federal land.
Does the Society have comprehensive and
up—to—date material on this? I would also
appreciate specific information on shooting
animals from planes in Alaska if you have it.
I assure you that my position is the same as
yours on this. On several occasions I have
heeded your request to write my legislators
on animal protective legislation and have
always received a personal letter of
acknowledgment.

Sincerely,

Raft,“ LIuML

your phraeo about the captive animals is wonderful.
I hope you won't mind if I pirate it from timo to

We took copies of tho oditorial to every momw

but, unluokily, the Thursday meeting was canceled
because there was a Republican conference about
the Presidential vetoes. Thus, the matter goes

Fbantimo, we will be circulating your editorial
to othor individuals and editors hoping thoy will

Scientific Sadism?

e UNLESS YOU HAVE A tolerance for cruelty, an
indifference to suffering and the inability to recognize idiocy

I solemnly posing as research, I suggest that you stay away

from the so-called science fairs which seem to have
proliferated in the past few years.

An article in the Animal Welfare Institute’s Information
Report by F. Barbara Orlans,tPh. D., and Charles F. Colao,
M. D., gives details on the sort of pseudo-scientific goings-on
which are exhibited at such fairs. They certainly cause
outrageous suffering for animals and, I suspect, have an
unhealthy impact on school children permitted to perpetrate
“experiments” which are inescapably reminiscent of some of
the ones done on humans in the Nazi era.

One of the exhibits at the International Science Fair in
Baltimore last May described how a 16-year-old boy Operated
on monkeys to plant electrodes in their brains after having
made the animals “neurotic” by administering electric shocks

‘ whenever the caged creatures tried to obtain food. His

scientific conclusions: “The monkey is very sensitive to pain”
and such brain-stimulation “could be used in the space
program to help astronauts during the long periods of tim
which lag.” ' '

a I FIND MYSELF repelled by such young “scientists” as
those who [1] told how a mouse being used for skin transplants
“died from being sewn up too many times” or [2] upon
operating on a pregnant mouse “found all baby mice dead.”
Nor can I believe that anything is being contributed to the
sum of human knowledge-except about the kind of kids we’re

‘ developing—by teen-age attempts at heart and pancreas

transplants or the induction of cancer in small animals
regardless of the animals’ torment and the actual danger to the
health of the “scientist.”

The article also cites the 17-year-old Kansan who so

. mistreated pregnant rabbits, by adminstering toxic substances,

that the animals developed abscesses, went blind and gave
birth to babies so tiny and malformed that the fun-loving
experimenter named two of them “Scabby Baby” and
“Minibaby.”

O IN WEST VIRGINIA a student in a Catholic school treated
mice with a tumor-producing substance until they developed
neck tumors as large as the mice themselves and were unable
to walk properly. Luckily for the subjects they only had to drag
themselves around for five months before death came.

“This unexhausted list of juvenile experiments is sufficient

I to demonstrate,” the article’ goes on, “that, unlike the
; Westinghouse Science Talent Search, which set an excellent

precedent this year of exhibiting no inhumane projects, the
standards of animal use at the 1970 International Science Fair .
are still intolerable. . . . One rule which has found favor with ‘1
several scientific societies and has been adopted by some
school boards and science competitions is that pre-university
students should not inflict pain on vertebrate animals. .
Typically, youngsters work alone in home basements, giving
small animals nutritionally deficient diets, or giving them !
alcohol instead of water, or killing them with cigaret smoke
Do you suppose they now give high school credits in.-
beginning and advanced sadism? r

3th Que Street, N.W.
Washington, E.C. 20007

Dear are. Stevens:

I have the following scrap of informa—
tion, or maybe it is mis-information; but it sounds
like something I déht to have if the story can be
verified. A

The story: that circa 1962 a group of
professors packed the annual meeting of the Dane
County humane Society at Madison, Wisconsin, and
decided that all dogs should be turned over to the
University of Wisconsin as experimental material.

Can you help on this, to confirm, verify,
add?

Can you think of any other instance of
infiltration or take~over of an animal-welfare
agency by interests which had something else in
mind than the well~beina of the animals?

With best wishes,

Truly yours,

[Whmi&Cank

Enclosed is a sample copy of the letter I've sent to each of the 15
members of the Subcommittee. I hope it will accomplish its aim. Should
nerawse
I receive any4l'll certainly let you know what it was.

I'm very enthusiastic about the existence of your organization and

grateful for the work it's doing.

.Dear Sir:

Reganding the Whitehurst and the Foley bills -— H.R. 13957 and H.R.
18637 respectively: I wish to urge you, being a member of the Subcommittee
on Livestock and Grains, to approve for inclusion in whatever version you
present to the House of Representatives those provisions contained in
Section 13 of H.R. 18637.

I feel that these provisions, which, essentially, are intended to
minimize the physical and mental anguish of laboratory animals, will serve
as vital checks on the thoughtless and sometimes wanton maltreatment of
living creatures. Every show of concern and respect for any form of life

will certainly behoove society as a whole.

Thank you for your valuable help.

Very respectfully yours,

(”lazy/meg)

Dear Harry,

It was goed talking with you again, and as you so kiné-
1y suggested, I'm.enclesing some material on the Whitahurst
and Foley Bills. They are quite similar, but the Foley Bill
which.was based on hsarings held on tha Whitehnrst Bill in
June has 80mm added featuras. The part we are asPeeially
anxious to 386 included in the Cammittae bill because it would
do so much.f0r animals is Saction l3 - especially the under—
lined words which include, where yracticable, analgesic and
tranquilizing drugs as a recognized part of the adequate vet~
erinary care alraady required in the Federal Labcratory gnimal
Haj-fare Aet, POL. 89"5 ‘0 ‘

Materials we have issued about the bills are enclosed.
Thanks so very mmch.for your unflagging interest.

Kinéest regards,

ﬂincerely,

Sorting the Mail

0 A PLEASANT LADY in. Rapid City, Mich, writes to say
that the boy who delivers her CHICAGO TRIBUNE accidentally
: broke a neighbor’s window with an off-aim toSs the other day,
i and because he’s such a fine youngster she mailed a dollar to
help pay for the damage. This was his reply:

“I thank you for going throught all of the trouble to send
me dollar and it is very nice to know that some of the
subscriber’s appreciate the service that I give them. As far as
i the window goes I pay for it in about 3 or 4 paychecks becuse
. Rollo [the manger] takes a little out at a time, so we’ll have a
, little money.

i “P. S. I thing it was a very thoughtful ideal.

“P. P. S. I don’t think that I will play pro baseball but it is

a thought.”

0 FROM BLOOMINGTON a note containing this suggestion,
along with a heated defense of Vice President Agnew and his
right to dissent:

“Last year 35,000 people were killed as the result of drunk -
drivers and 9,365 were killed in Viet Nam. Why don’t you .
writers start a campaign against booze?” i

And from a Chicagoan who failed to set down a return
address:

“Integration in education, housing, etc, is the biggest
failure of social reformers [a class of individuals composed of
misfits and social agitatorsl.”

One of my regular correspondents, a South Side resident
with a deep concern for mistreated animals, sends along a
two-page advertisement, from a recent copy of Vogue, bearing
this heading:

DOES THE INTERNATIONAL BEAUTY WHO BOUGHT
A 10-SKIN TIGER MAXI-COAT KNOW THAT THERE ARE
NOW ONLY 590 TIGERS LEFT ALIVE?

The same letter was accompanied by a tearsheet from an
animal-protection group protesting the action by the state of
Florida in legalizing “bloodless bullfighting” as a tourist
attraction. The bill, which became law when Gov. Claude Kirk
failed to veto it, was passed with a minimum of advance
publicity and little debate, and may backfire.

There is a movement already started by various groups,
among them the Fund for Animals, 1 Wall St., New York City,
, headed by Cleveland Amory, to persuade all animal-loving
tourists to boycott Florida unless and until the law is repealed.
The thought expressed by many persons—who also oppose
raccoon-baiting which is permitted in Alabama—is that it is a
poor “sport” which consists of amusing spectators by
tantalizing and goading an animal.

0 AND FINALLY, from another Chicagoan:

“Nothing satisfies a smart elec impudent punk like you
than to take a dig at the police or the Nixon administration. I
back the police even when they crack heads for one speaks to
other people in the way they can understand and certain people
. more than ever before only understand force. , . . Lots of luck

all bad to you.”

As a matter of fact nothing satisfies a smart elec impudent
punk like me more than to get angry letters from extremists
on either end of the ideological spectrum.

It’s no fun never knowing whether the shots hit home.

Dear Silence,

Thanks for your good lettsr and gonerous chock. we‘ll
see that your Monitor mailing is stopped.

Eholosed is a copy of the article about the last Inter-
national Science Fair which.will appear in the forthcoming
Animal Welfaro Institute Information-Report. As you-can see,
ﬁhsro is no sign that anyone is following in wastinghouso's“
footsteps as yet. I think it would be.a good thing to praise
thomland to urge othors to take steps to stop cruel projects

by putting the young people on notice-that they won't be con-
s.d .

cred for exhibition or prizes.

I don't know the answer to your quostions about cosmetic
manufacturers. However, there is goodnisws that sperm whales
and most baleon whales haVe been put on tho Endangered Species
list and that moans.that whale oil can't be imported into ¥
this country after the law goes into effect. Apparontly our
country has been using 20% of the oommoroial products of world
whaling so that should be a considerable detarrentto Russia
and Japan who are the:major villains in this. .

Why don't you,writa a letter to the manufacturer of any
cosmetics you use asking him.what it's made of, and telling.
him.why you’re aSking. That might do some good in itself.

Congressman Foley is drafting a new bill which.should help
to get prompt committee action on the Whitehorst bill. I an

.hopoful that a roquiromont for pain-relieving drugs can be in‘
‘cluded. That would mmkn the bill doubly worth fighting for.

 

As soon as this now bill is introduced I'll let you know.“
Until it is, it-would be best to treat it confidentially. Lot's
hopolv ' .

All the best,

Dear Christine:

I have received the latest bulletin, and have, of course,
written all the letters indicated. I'm going to write a letter,

\\K also, to the Buffalo Evening News, as well as to my little county

fg/paper, hoping to stir up some interest in this area.

I know you will want to take my name off your mailing list
that carries the Monitor address. I believe we mentioned this
before, maybe on the telephone, but the bulletins still come to
me in care of the Monitor, and the Monitor dutifully forwards them.
You might as well save this postage, small though it is. You also
have this address, and the bulletins reach me here okay. The
Monitor one is just extra.

30 you know yet whether or not any other “science fair” people
ruled out animal experimentation? If Westinghouse was the only one,
maybe the Monitor will give them credit in an editorial. They were
so grieved (that is the only word for it-— they didn't seem offended)
that we singled them out in the other editorial, we might give them
a pat on the back now that they've been good.

Here is something that has been on my mind for a while: why
don't cosmetic manufacturers have to specify ingredients on their
labels, the same as the manufacturers of foods and drugs? I suppose
there is no law to cover it-- but shouldn't there be? I often wonder,
when I use a cosmetic, especially one containing emollients, whether
the oils or what-not come from some endangered species-- or from an
animal at all, for that matter. It bothers me. There is a movement
in England, "Beauty without Cruelty,” whose moving spirit has been
Lady Dowding, widow of the recently deceased M.P. Lord Dowding. I
have known about it for quite a while, and have been investigating
it more closely lately. They manufacture their own products, and
have their own boutique, where they sell man-made furs as well as
cosmetics with no animal oils. And of course in England they don't
have to test their products on animals as we do here. But it is
something of a bother to order one's cosmetics from England! They
don't haVera well organized price list, and pounds and shillings always
baffle me. Has an effort been made to require a list of ingredients
on all cosmetic packages?

I'm enclosing another small donation. No acknowledgment
necessary.

With warmest good wishes,

Dear Mrs. Hutchinson:

First, forgive me for holding the photograph so long,
but according to Ms. Stevens' letter (xerox copy en—
closed) I did not need to worry about returning it
since she had a copy of the photograph.

T.F.H. publications, the company which_reviewed the
manuscript and the photographs, kept both the copy

and the art work for nine months. They apologized for
keeping it so long, for they planned to publish it, but
had to change their minds and so returned it.

I am preparing to send the manuscript out again—~along
with the photographs, of course.

If you need a copy, I can have a negative made from
the print you sent me and can send it to you——since
I assume you must have loaned out or cannot locate
the negative you had made when Ms. Stevens send me
the.print I have now.

Please let me know.
Very truly yours,

Turkey

ed

‘9 THE CONTROVERSY over the use of live turkeys as
targets during the Kiwanis club of Kewaskum [Wis] annual
fund raising event seems to have been resolved in a fashion
which should satisfy all involved, including the turkeys.

At the recent meeting in Detroit of the board of trustees of
Kiwanis International, the president of Kiwanis, Bob Weber,
made a report on a visit earlier in the month to Kewaskum in-

   

 

‘which he and the international secretary, R. P. Merridew of

Chicago, discussed the turkey shoot with John L. Battaglia,
Kewaskum club president. The result of the board meeting is
told in a letter sent to Battaglia by Merridew, part of which
follows: V

“The excellent record of service to your community,
established over the years by the Kiwanis Club of Kewaskum,
was warmly applauded by the board. There is no doubt that the
proceeds from the Turkey Shoot have been put to very good
use.

“Recently, as you are well aware, considerable objection has
been raised to your use of live turkeys as targets in what has
been an annual event. Hundreds of letters have been received
by Kiwanis International as a direct result of an article in the
March, 1970, Report of the National Catholic Society for
Animal Welfare, followed up by two full columns and several
additional paragraphs . . . in THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE.

“After careful consideration of all of the above, the board
on June 25, unanimously adopted the following resolution:

O“WHEREAS, THE BOARD of Trustees of Kiwanis

, International has had brought to its attention the use of live

turkeys 1n a fund raising activity of a Kiwanis Club'f and

“Whereas public reaction to such use would appear to
impugn the good name of Kiwanis,

“BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED

“That the Board of Trustees of Kiwanis International is of
the opinion that the use of live turkeys as targets is
objectionable and must be discontinued.

“BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED

“That the Secretary of Kiwanis International be directed to
inform the President of the Kiwanis Club of Kewaskum
Wisconsin of this board’s finding and to direct said club to
discontinue the use of live turkeys as targets in fund raising
activities.”

0 THE LETTER continued by saying that the board hoped: _
“. . . that the, public-service minded Kiwanians in the
tKewaskum Club will see their way clear to continue the
Kewaskum Turkey Shoot for many years to come, but using
inanimate objects as targets, with turkeys—live or otherwise—
being used only as prizes. Several‘excellent suggestions for
ingenious mechanical targets have been put forth, and I shall
be glad to share them with you and your fellow members.
“With every good Wish, Sincerely, R. P. [Reg ] Merridew,‘
International Secretary.”
My congratulations to the Kiwanians. ,

Mrs. Christine Stevens, President
Animal Welfare Institute

3th Que Street, N.W.

washington, D.C. 20007

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

It was good of you to keep in mind my
interest in the episode involving Dr. Ivy and Irene
Castle. I know how elusive such an item can be; I
thank you for trying. It isn't so terribly impor~
tant except that I do need any light moment I can
conjure up for my book. I sometimes fear that the
narrative is so stark, so forbidding, so humiliat-
ing, that I shall simply drive the readers away.

I am not trying to make the book accusatory. The
facts take care of that!

I am about half way through.

The rodeo article is scheduled for Apr~
11, 1971, in American heritage.

 

Rodeo is not a high—priority topic for
you, I know, but you may be interested in the fact
that the Rodeo Cowboy Association was employed to
stage a go-around in Dutchess County near toughkeep-
sie last month. For a worthy charity, of course.

I alerted The National Catholic Society
for Animal Welfare and the Friends of Animals. Miss
Harrington ran two advertisements in the goughkeepsie
Journal and Miss Jones a single_but quite large in-
sertion. There was a riposte from an ad hoc society,
the "Animal Protective Association” -*3 TEEe, of course,
telling about how healthy andbappy rodeo animals are.
There was the usual hypocrisy about supervision by
"the humane society".

 

But critical letters were written private-
ly and some appeared in the newspaper. I hope, and
rather believe, that those concerned will think twice
before again taking the rodeo route to raise funds.

Dear Miss Stevens:

Thank you for your nice letter and the enclosed information.

I have put you on subscription, so you should be receiving
POpular Dogs on a regular basis from now on, and if you don't,
let me know.

Yes, I would love to meet you also. In fact, I have a germ of
an idea in my mind that help our situation but it's not quite
ready though I mentioned it to Bill Carr last time we had dinner.
Perhaps by the time you get to Philadelphia, or I to Washington,
it will have formulated.

By the way, I have spoken before about 17 kennel clubs on Pet
ShOps Pounds and Politicians the last few months. If ever you
need Someone to help you lobby, I'm a good public speaker, thanks
to a Show bysiﬁés background. Let me know if I can help. Lots
of f lks mean welt but get tongue-tied in front of audiences.

Best regards,

The Cruel Rodeo

GARE YOU a rodeo fan? Perhaps you should write the
National Catholic Society for Animal Welfare, Inc., and the
Humane Society of the United States, for their booklets on
what happens behind-the-scenes in preparation for this
so-called “sport.”

Here is a statement from the first—named group, which is
at 509 Madison av., New York City:

“In 1965 Ohio became the first state to enact a law
prohibiting the use of bucking straps, flank straps, electric or
other prods and similar devices used in rodeos. While the Ohio
law does not prohibit rodeos, by outlawing the use of the
standard rodeo devices by which the animals are tortured into
‘performing,’ the law in effect ends the rodeos in Ohio.”

Elsewhere in the pamphlet charges are made that
‘ “Tail-twisting, ear-biting, kicks, spurs with rowels that dig into
the flesh until it is torn and bleeding—these are among other
rodeo practices used to force docile, domesticated, terrified
animals to run, buck and otherwise ‘perform’ for the
entertainment of the spectators.

“Before the animals used in rodeos are forced into the
chutes from which they enter the arena they can be seen
standing quietly in the pens or corrals. They are not wild, they
are domesticated. The horses are accustomed to being ridden.
The Brahma bulls, advertised as ‘wild’ and ‘dangerous’, are
such docile animals that in India they are permitted to roam
the streets.

“When the rodeo ends, the music stops and the crowd
leaves, thinking it has" had a glimpse of Western life; the
animals, back in their pens, are still suffering. There are
broken bones, raw and bleeding wounds, splintered or broken
horns. There is pain and shock. Some of the animals are still
trembling hours later, others are down and unable to rise.

“Rodeos are neither entertainment nor sport. They' are
exhibitions of suffering inflicted on animals.”

This is the mildest of the two pamphlets. That issued by the
Humane society, 1145 Nineteenth st., N. W., Washington, D. C.
20036, is even more outspoken in its listing of the cruelty ‘
visited on the animals involved. ' '

Copies of a model bill, which the Humane society urges be
passed in all states where rodeos are permitted, are available
from the society on request.

0 IN THE SAME general area lies the problem of the “last
wild‘ horses,” ‘which Howard H.- Caudle, vice-president,
International Defenders of Animals, says roam public lands in
Colorado’s Bookcliff mountain range.

“They are without legal protection,” Candle writes, “and
they are very cruelly treated by Sunday afternoon cowboys.
The horses are shot at and some are killed on the spot to feed
caged bears and mountain lions, which are used in Colorado’s
illegal ‘canned’ hunts. . . . Over the years many of . the
Bookcliff wild horses have found their way . . . to the dog food
factory.

“In an effort to bring conservation and clemency to the
Bookcliff herds, the Colorado branch of the International
Defenders of Animals, Inc., has petitioned the United States
department of the interior to set aside on the public lands a
wild horse refuge, the numbers to remain below 101 wild horses
in keeping with sound range management, by the use of strict

 

 

humane controls.”

Caudle may be reached at 449 North 18th st., Grand Junc-

tion, Colo. 81501.

 

HOLDUP CASE TO GRAND JURY

James Walker, 42, of 1234
Wabash av., accused of robbing
a Loop subway station and
holding a 16-year-old girl as a
hostage Tuesday, was bound
over to the grand jury by Judge
John F. Hechinger in Violence
court.

Walker was arrested in a ,cab
with the hostage, Miss Vera
Baclic, 5736 Bernard st. Miss
Baclic was entering the sub-
way station’ at Madison and
State streets when Walker was
fleeing with $323 he had taken
from the cashier and ordered
her to go with him.

 

 

John Arnold, a patrolman
assigned to the Chicago transit ,
authority tactical unit, sur- J
prised Walker during the rob-g
bery and chased him, firing one
shot. Walker jumped into a cab
with Miss Baclic. He sur-
rendered without a struggle
when police stopped the cab at
State and Van ‘Buren streets.
Walker w a 5 charged with
armed robbery, aggravated as-
sault and unlawful restraint.

HUNDRED ACRE WELCOME

What a famed naturalist learns as he ﬁts a “useless,” im-
pulse-bought Chincoteague pony into his lOO-acre wildlife
refuge in Vermont. “Hundred Acre Welcome” is a refresh-
ing, reassuring book of real people. It is valuable for those
of us who wish to believe that there remain little corners of
the American scene where a wagonload of children are wel-
come to realize a dream.” Illust. by Robert MacLean. $4.95

yr THE LO0N IN MY BATHTUB

And where else would you put a captive loon at home?
The author tells how he and his family keep wildlife as
guests around the house (and which ones not to invite) in
a ﬁne book of awareness and enjoyment of nature. “The
Loon in My Bathtub will help even the apartment-born
American feel at home in the world of wild life”—-Justice
William 0. Douglas. Many Photos. $4.50

LAND ALIVE

“This book holds high distinction, both for its quietly
beautiful text and for its at once accurate and lovely black
and white drawings. It’s a preparation, or companion, or
substitute for a leisurely and prolonged walk in ﬁelds, wood-
lands or marshes, in Spring, Summer, Autumn or Winter.
Its highest service is to help us see and understand the
wealth of Nature’s life that we too largely overlook. It be-
longs to a high literary tradition and a noble one.”——John T.

New Scientist 10 October 1968

Primate overkill

‘The slaughterof primates for scientific research poses an urgent problem for conservationists

Above and below a torrid little town that used to be
called Stanlcyville. the Lokele people roll messages
up and down the Upper Congo on twotoned slit
drums hung up in the trees for the long distance
stuff. From afar. the Ion/tellr-Innk-Inn/t sounds like
rapid resonant morse. Sometime towards the end
of 1956. as I can personally attest, the Stanleyville
length of the service went commercial. Instead of
news about births and deaths, of feasts to come and
food or ﬁsh-nets wanted, the Lokele spelt out the
' news that “the Spirits of the Forest" were offering
big money for “the little hairy ones”.

Translated from the complex drum code this
meant that the white men (in this instance Belgians
working on behalfof a big American drug corpora
tion with a field station at nearby Lindi) wanted not
just chimpanzees, but a particular species called the
Bonabo (Pan pmziseus). This is a rare. slender,
serologically interesting and rather solitary species,

markedly distinct from the creatures usually seen

capering about in zoo “tea parties". ,

How many Bonabo were crudely trapped. irregu—
larly collected and housed near the Lindi river will
" never be known. I saw several cages full of animals
that had just been antibiotically purged and then
infected with either live or dead poliomyelitis vac—
cine. But it was reckoned distinctly, unsafe even for
the White Spirits of the Forest to approach animals

mission . . . range, very small . . . status, rare . . .
estimated numbers, unknown. Reason for decline,
destruction of high forest habitat. Nonsense!
Highly-profitable spoilage

The last' word is mine. It may well be that
deafforestation (which was not locally remarkable)
tended to concentrate Pan paniscus. But the fact is
that the river people rose and knocked off every
animal they could lind and got well paid for
negligible pains. This is happening all over the
warmer parts of the world where the eleven families
and sixty genera of Man’s poor relations, the
. non-human primates, are ripe for highly proﬁtable
spoilage. ‘ .,

The hot, money-raising propaganda of con—
servation is usually pitched towards the fate of
whooping cranes, bald eagles and blue whales“
animals which have no immediately obvious value
for research. Nevertheless, conservationists have
suspected for some time now that some of the most
hard—pressed monkey—hunting grounds in India,
especially Uttar Pradesh (the prime source of rhe-
sus), and primate habitats in Kenya, Somalia,
Ethiopia and the Colombian part of the Amazonian
forests, for New World species, are being slowly
cleaned out. But until now speciﬁc figures were
hard to come by. Now some have been published,
unequivocally. by the Fauna Preservation Society.
In the current issue of the society’s journal, ()rj’x.

“LA --- . ..

Mr T. W. Roth, a former animal collector and now
a professional zoo adviser based in Washington
DC has described the overpowering proportions
of the overkill as it exists today.

He says the last meaningful rhesus population
census was taken nearly a decade ago. when India
exported 200 000 to 250 000 animals annually, of
which more than 85 per cent were juveniles—that
is weighing between ﬁve and seven pounds. Ine-
vitably, the numbers declined and in ~1965 the
export had dropped to 38 870 rhesus of which
24 456 went to the USA. The latest ﬁgures indi—
cate that the US is now receiving three—quarters
of the exported Indian primates.

Rhesus, favourite for research

Although only about 60 per cent of the recipients
returned questionnaires, a survey conducted by the
US Institute of Laboratory Animals Resources
(ILAR) shows that in 1966 US researchers used
62 783 primates of which a mere 4 079 were bred
in the country. The previous year, the US Public
Health authorities listed 105 103 non~speciﬁed
“monkeys”, 308 chimpanzees and 14 gorillas as
inspected at port of entry. From these ﬁgures it
becomes evident that the US is now absorbing more
than half of all primates supplied. Rhesus. says
Roth, has become the favourite near—human model
for all phases of bio-medical research. This is partly
because of its original abundance and easy availa-
bility, but mainly because. due to extensive use, it is
at present the primate with the most thoroughly
documented biological data, thus saving researchers
time and effort for base-line studies.

Roth reckons that only about 50 per cent of the
collected total number of primates become subjects
of meaningful research. The remaining 50 per cent
are a total loss. An average of 15 per cent perish
between trap and export compounds. some die in
transit. Many never reach experimentation stage.
Due to delayed stress reactions.inadequate facili-
ties ‘and inexperienced maintenance in research
colonies. they ﬁnish up in the incinerator.

At the very least, the researcher who wants
nothing but a particular organ for his project
should be obliged to share the rest with others in
the ﬁeld and ensure that whatever remains goes to
medical schools for training purposes. And, of
course, ideally, they should be laboratory-bred
specimens and not parasite-ridden imports.

In Britain, the Universities Federation for Ani—
mal Welfare has said that the necessity to use
laboratory animals in certain testing procedures “is
open to question“. It considers that demands for
safety in drugs and other consumer products have
resulted in much unnecessary testing and duplica~
tion of experiments without obtaining predictable
results applicable to humans. Meantime. if the
slaughter of primates cont' at the present rate.
researchers will be obliged to change their policy. as
there won’t be enough animals to go round.

Sancﬁﬁed
torture

Squirrel monkey which
had undergone amateur
surgery and attempted
implantation of electrodes
in its brain two weeks
before this picture was
taken. It died a few
.hours later as a result
of the infected wound
hidden by the dental
, caulk, and general lack
of care

Science Fair for demonstrating “Neuro—electro
telestimulation and epileptic form reactions” (sic)
on squirrel monkeys. Four relics of his previous
experiments on 25 monkeys, including one dying
wreck with pus-exuding holes in its head. were
photographed and shown to busloads of Detroit
school children at the International Science Fair in
Cobo Hall, Detroit. There the experiment came to a
stop (perhaps only temporarily) as a result of a civil
investigation.

The investigation is substantiated by Dr Barbara
Orlans. a physiologist well~versed in animal ex~
perimentation. a researcher who has been associat~
ed with projects at London University. Johns Hop—
kins and the US National Institutes of Health. It
has been attested by a pathologist. Dr Kenneth
Keahey of Michigan State University Veterinary
College and published by the instigators of the

. investigation, the Animal Welfare Institute of New

York (Information Report, vol. 17, no. 2).

The institute is an organization which, like the
Universities Federationfor Animal Welfare in Bri—
tain. believes that (to quote Schweitzer): “In every
single instance . . . (the scientist) must consider
whether it is really necessary to demand of an
animal this sacriﬁce for Man”. (The emphasis is
mine.)

The Ashford story. as related by the AWI. is
thoroughly unhappy. and reﬂects. principally.
against those who bore the responsibility for the
actions and attitudes of the youthful experimenter
concerned~-a charge which. on the printed
evidence, implicates local members of the American
Medical Association who gave a dinner in honour
of the exhibitor.

Operation planned
before photographers

It seems that from the age of 14. young Ashford
had been using stereotaxic equipment. that is an
immobilizing vice. the adjustable bars of which can
be screwed on to the skulls of monkeys. enabling
the user to place electrodes. or other instruments at
a chosen .spot within the animal‘s brain. When
interrogated. Ashford had already implanted four
electrodes into one very sick animal. and hoped to
insert others in the presence of photographers
from a German magazine.

The sick animal was prostrate when seen by Mrs
Dorothy Dyce. the laboratory animal consultant of
the AWI. Inquiry revealed that the veterinary
surgeon who-had inspected the exhibits on the ﬁrst
day of the fair told the fair director that the monkey
needed attention. but the young prize-winner said
he could take care of the monkey himself. Two
days later. the animal was so much worse that the
fair directorordered it to be taken to a veterinarian
who gave it a shot of penicillin which proved
ineffective. Young Ashford claimed that he was
visiting Detroit “on an expense account" and hoped
to get a grant “to do more surgery“.

After attending to the monkey. Mrs Dyce tele—
phoned the Michigan State Health Department to
get an opinion on the legality of the proposed
electrode implantations in unlicensed premises. and
was advised that it would be appropriate for her to

New Scientist 9 January 1969

take a copy of the Michigan State law and show it
to the organizers. Returning to the exhibition hall.
Mrs Dyce found that it was closed to the public at
nine o’clock. but at that hour those who were
attending the American Medical Association dinner
in honour of the exhibitors returned to the building.
Mrs Dyce was thanked by the fair directorate for
heading off the exhibition surgery which. they said.
would have most seriously damaged the reputation
of the hall and its science fair. But Mrs Ashford
who had accompanied her son to Detroit was
“irate” when informed that his international televi—
sion appearance would be illegal. “We don‘t have a
law like that in Mississippi." she stated emphatical-
lv. '

That night the monkey died from a variety of ills
including purulent infection located beneath the
dental caulking which covered the amateur experi—
menter’s surgical efforts. A necropsy disclosed
large areas of sloughed and necrotic skin. The
electrodes did not pass through the skull into the

' brain tissue. nevertheless there were holes through

which they-could have passed if they had been
embedded properly. There was extensive haemor—
rhage in that area.

Increase in student
backyard surgery

The foregoing is a sad example of what seem to
be quite common practices in some American
schools and homes. This is clear from analyses of
10 recent science fairs which show that 20 per cent
of entries (l57 out of 802) involved pain or death to
higher animals. Dr ()rlans says that during the last
decade there has been “an alarming increase" in
what she calls student backyard surgery. This
includes skin grafting. the removal of organs. elec-
trical stimulation. intensive irradiation. and drug
and poison injections (especially those calculated to
produce malformed offspring in pregnant animals).

Due to the extracurricular nature of science
competitions. the projects are usually conducted in
basements. bedrooms or garages. where equipment
limitations alone turn them into a form of elaborate
butcvhery in which helpless animals are wounded.
maimed or killed. But it would be grossly unfair to
suggest that all school and state authorities are
turning a blind eye to what is going on. A Washing-
ton state law requires that “Not less than 10
minutes each week must be devoted to the system?
atic teaching of kindness to not, only domestic but
to all living creatures . . . a general philosophy of
thoughtfulness and consideration for living things
should be incorporated and repeatedly emphasized
in all science teaching.” Other states have proc~
laimed similar injunctions.

The Science Teacher, a widely read journal, has
published articles by Dr Orlans and others on the
boundaries of use of animals in high school biology.
and the National Academy of Sciences‘ Institute of
Laboratory Animal Resources has suggested that
insects. other invertebrates. and protozoa are the
materials of choice for most experiments. But if
some move toward a moral sanity in this particular
area of school life has been made. it is evident that
much remains to be done.

M an, the Despoiler, has reck-
lessly squandered much of Na-
ture’s bountiful wealth — strip-
ped the forests, poisoned the wa-
ters, polluted the air. Man, the
Despniler. has, by his profligate
use of bird, beast and denizen of
the sea, completely obliterated
many species; many others are
endangered. Conservationists and
humanitarians have joined efforts
to reverse this trend.

bill designed to protect these
creatures from extmc ion is in
committee in the United States
Senate. It is the Endangered
Species Bill, HR11618, and as with
all proposed humane legislation,
it is meeting strong opposition
from those more interested in
their money bags than in the fate
of the creatures they vi-ctimize.
Such legislation would hopefully
keep, let us say, far example, the
Cheetah, from becoming as ex-
tinct: as the dado bird and the di-
nosaur.

Hear Miss Stevens:

I'm sorry, but my speech on "Pet ShOps, Pounds and Politicians"
is given from notes. . .I'm better and prefer to Speak extempor-
aneously.

I understand, however, that it was tape-recorded at a meeting
of the Overseas Press Club so if I locate it perhaps I could
have it taken down in shorthand.

Meantime I will include some of my related editorials which sill
keep you up to date on some of my related endeavors. Let me
know if you would like to have a complimentary subscription to
Popular Dogs if you don't get one already.

Have been anxious to meet you. A mutual friend, William H. A. Carr,

An Editorial . . .

The
THREAT

of

POUND SEIZURE in NEW jERSEY

ON APRIL 3rd, 1968, in the War Memorial
Building in Trenton, New Jersey, a public
hearing was held to assess public reaction to
the proposed Rules and Regulations Governing
the Operation and Maintenance of Kennels,
Pet Shops, Shelters and Pounds. If put into
law, these rules and regulations would lead to
legalized dognapping in the State of New
Jersey.

Already defeated several times as legislation,
the oﬂﬁce of the Commissioner of Health for
the State of New Jersey once again was trying
to push through a set of Regulations which
would allow the sale of animals to research
laboratories, and allow for their disposal or
destruction in whatever manner the pound-
keeper saw ﬁt.

The meeting room was jammed with people
representing all kinds of organizations wish-
ing to make their feelings known.

Dognapping is already a very serious prob-
lem in the State of New Jersey; so serious that
the Honorable Henry Helstoski introduced into
the Congressional Record on October 11, 1965,
an extension of the text of his Bill H. R.
10743 dealing with the problem of organized
dog and cat stealing. The Rules and Regula-
tions contained in the document offered by
the Department of Health would legalize the
sale of animals to research laboratories. With
this "ready market” for all animals, dognapping
would grow by leaps and bounds. No dog or
cat in the State would be safe from its front
door to the nearest tree.

Even as things stand now, many unscrupu-
lous dog wardens are using taxpayers’ dollars
to "seize” our dogs and cats and bring them
into a pound, where they are supposedly kept
for seven days before being disposed of in one
manner or another. These Rules and Regula-
tions would permit the selling of these animals
to laboratories at the highest prices ever paid
for "sacriﬁcial” animals! AND NOWHERE
IN THIS DOCUMENT DOES IT STATE
WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH THE
MONEY THEY RECEIVE FOR THE SALE
OF THESE ANIMALS! Prices, by the way, are
now around $12. per cat and up to $40. per
dog. Over one million dogs and over one-half
million cats are sold to tax-supported institu-
tions each year. That represents a lot of money
and most all transactions are in cash! Little
wonder a lot of people would like to see this
trafﬁc "stepped up!” One New Jersey city has
already had a scandal uncovered on the mis-
appropriation of such funds!

Two other points that were greatly disputed
were methods of the destruction of animals
while on pound premises and the decision as
to whether or net an animal had rabies. The
fact that these Rules and Regulations allow the
poundkeeper to destroy an animal or to let a
member of the Department of Health deter-

by Joan Brearley

mine a "mad dog,” were vehemently opposed
and deemed not to be left under the jurisdic-
tion of the Department
SHOULD BE LEFT ENTIRELY TO A VET-
ERINARIAN.

Other objections were to the manner in
which the hearing itself was conducted. Dr.
Roscoe Kandle, State Commissioner of Health,
did not even attend . . . an inexcusable and
uncalled for interruption of a most respected
veterinarian (representing two veterinary
groups) caused considerable commotion . . .
and the meeting only came back to order after
a hastily called "recess” when the stamping
of feet and public outcries against a subse-
quent veterinarian (speaking in favor of the
rules and regulations) rambled away from the
subject, whereas the previous veterinarian had
been asked to curtail his remarks after speak-
ing only a few minutes.

Another doctor present prefaced his remarks
with the astonishing admission that he had
only seen the document “for a few minutes”
but could see "nothing wrong with it.” A den-
tist was for pound seizure because his college
laboratory had to pay twelve dollars for a cat
now, where before the cost was only two
dollars.

The most encouraging point made was by
legal counsel for one of the humane organiZa-
tions. Their lawyer stood up and declared in
no uncertain terms that if these Rules and
Regulations were put into effect, he would
start immediate suit as they were illegal and
unconstitutional!

It was gratifying to see the number of
veterinarians and government ofﬁcials present
from other states who wanted to witness these
proceedings—"So we Can guard against it
happening in our State,” one of them told me
without hesitation. It was also gratifying to
see that the majority of the people present
were against the Rules and Regulations as they
stood. And it was most signiﬁcant, I believe,
that, even though I requested a count of the
"For” and "Against” votes on the cards signed
by everyone as they came into the hearing,
they would not reveal it. Even though it is
not required to do so at a public hearing——
why were they NOT willing to reveal the ﬁnal
tally? I can only assume that the ﬁnal count
was overwhelmingly against the Rules and
Regulations . . .

Any human being with a compassion for
living things could not help but feel sad that
in this day and age it should be necessary to
have to publicly speak out against cruelty and
for kindness to animals.

As editor of Popular Dogs, I felt it essential
to attend these hearings and to not only speak
against them, but to report on these proceed-
ings if only to make other people in other
states aware of the fact that Pound Seizure

of Health but'

could happen in their state! (It has already
been defeated in California.) Pound Seizure
does NOT and SHOULD NOT come under
the jurisdiction of the Department of Health
—it is their job to keep things CLEAN by
routine inspection, and, while the present
ofﬁcials have been on the job for a long time,
with taxpayers’ funds available, a majority of
the dog pounds are in deplorable condition.
They would do better to "clean house” before
initiating the trafﬁc that the legal Pound
Seizure would bring into the communities,
making ”Dog Dachaus” out of the already
overcrowded pound enclosures.

We must all see to it that such legislation
which would allow our animals—which are
personal property—to be "seiZed" by those
who like to call themselves public servants and
then sold to experimental laboratories for enor-
mous proﬁts AT OUR OWN EXPENSE—is
defeated!

A few wee-ks after this hearing, in an appear-
ance on the Cleveland Amory television show,
I discussed this matter at great length with Mr.
Amory, who also is vehemently opposed to
Pound Seizure. I made it known to the tele-
vision audience what was involved in these
Rules and Regulations. When Mr. Amory
asked me at the conclusion of our talk, what
people could do to help get this defeated, I
suggested that everyone write to Governor
Hughes and go on record as being against the
Rules and Regulations as they now stand.

It is my understanding that over 6,000 let-
ters were received and that these Rules and
Regulations will NOT be put into effect AT
THE PRESENT TIME. So—this is a tem-
porary victory! It is a safe assumption that
they will rewrite this document, and will un-
doubtedly put it through this time WITHOUT
a public hearing (which, unfortunately, they
can do! ); and then use more taxpayers’ money
to ﬁght for it in court when the humane or-
ganizations put its constitutional legality to
the test.

So—we may have to do some more writing
to Governor Hughes (with carbon copies to
the Governors of your own states to let them
know you do not want Pound Seizure in your
state either)! State residents should remind
Governor Hughes that we do not intend for
Pound Seizure to become a reality in the
State of New Jersey and that we will voite and
campaign accordingly in coming elections if
the APPOINTED veterinarians in the Depart-
ment of Health continue to try to put these
Rules and Regulations into effect. We must
go on record as being AGAINST POUND
SEIZURE. We must let the ELECTED officials
know that WE know the APPOINTED ofﬁcials
in the State Department of Health are over-
step'ping their authority in the name of the
aw.

an editorial . . .

ATTENTION GOVERNOR SPIRO AGNEW!

WE INTEND

TO FIGHT

POUND SEIZURE IN MARYLAND!

Once again it seems to be necessary for humanitarians concerned with
the welfare of animals to get busy and prevent the conﬁscation of our
animals from Pounds and Humane Shelters for release to laboratories
for research!

After the recent defeat of the Pound Seizure Regulation in New
Jersey, I have received word from Amelia Dassinger and Miss Martha
Pett of the Prince Georges County Humane Society in Beltsville,
Maryland, who are faced with the problem now.

At right, we publish Miss Pett’s reply to her letter of protest to
Governor Agnew; below, we publish the Maryland State Depart-
ment’s report on the subject sent to Miss Pett.

September 11, 1968

The Maryland State Department of Health’s Report on the Utilization
of Impounded Animalr by Maryland Medical Institutions.

0 In June 1965, the Medical Schools of the Johns Hopkins University
and the University of Maryland asked the State Health Department
to assist them in establishing a suitable source of dogs and cats
from municipally owned and operated animal pounds, the intended
use being for teaching and bio-medical research.

In 1966, there was widespread publicity criticizing animal dealers
and their facilities; news releases by humane organizations pointed
out the inhumane treatment of animals by animal dealers. Inquiry
into the court records of Baltimore County do not show that a farm
which received national attention for its inhumane treatment of
animals ~told animal: either directly or indirectly to Maryland
medical schools.

Out-of-State Residents! Don’t hesitate to write Governor Agnew!
Governor Agnew aspires to being the Vice-President of the
United States! Let him know how we feel about Pound Seizure
should he be elected!

POPULAR DOGS

POUND SEIZURE CONTINUED

0 There is a Maryland procedure for municipal pounds giving ani-
mals to medical institutions. The Baltimore City Council on Decem-
ber 17, 1949 passed an ordinance which required that dogs
consigned to be killed by the municipal pound would be offered to
the medical institutions of the City for teaching and furthering bio-
medical inquiry. On January 12, 1950, rules and regulations for
implementing this ordinance were passed by the City Council. This
ordinance was challenged by a public referendum on November 7,
1950. The ordinance was overwhelmingly afﬁrmed (160,264 votes
for the ordinance, 38,445 votes opposed).

During the following 18 years, SOME county governments have
jOined Baltimore City in donating their unclaimed animals to medi-
cal institutions.

In 1965, the State Health Department acted in favor of granting
the request of the medical schools. The program activity was as-
Signed to the Division of Veterinary Medicine.

The Health Department is concerned with proper animal control
Since _a serious animal problem exists which is caused by thousands
of animals annually biting Maryland citizens. This has resulted in a
serious and costly medical problem. In 1966, animal wounds caused
by dogs resulted in two deaths and an estimated 15,000 animal
bites had occurred. In 1967, an improved bite reporting system
caused Maryland physicians and hospitals to report 16,703 animal
bites (90% by dogs) to local health departments. In order to bring
about better animal control, A Sari/e31 of Animal Control Activities
in.Maryland, 1964, was prepared by Dr. Crawford. (The data for
this document was collected by local ofﬁcials. The methods of the
study have been cited favorably and publicized by the U. S. Public
Health Service.) This document along with Dr. Crawford’s com-
mentary was widely distributed in the state. This program activity
has given Dr. Crawford an excellent fund of knowledge concerning
Maryland animal pounds and animal control procedures.

As a result of the ﬁndings of this survey, a series of Model Animal
Ordinances were drafted by the department. The primary objective
of this document was to give local ofﬁcials an ordinance which they
could use to decrease their problems of animal origin. In the past
21/2 years, Cecil, Harford, Anne Arundel, Montgomery, Prince
George’s and Worcester Counties have either adopted this ordinance
or have drawn from its contents.

A further outgrowth of this study was the acknowledgment that
substantial legislative progress could not be made by humane or-
ganizations unless there was a lessening in the areas of conﬂict
which regularly developed between the scientiﬁc community and the
humane interest when humane treatment bills were introduced in
the State Legislature. Dr. Crawford was asked by the Legislative
CounCil in .1966 to form and to be Chairman of an Ad Hoc Com-
mittee conSisting of a representative membership from the scientiﬁc
community .and the humane animal treatment interest. Their as-
Signed ml'SSlOﬂ was to draft and to endorse legislation intended for
the state legislature. Bills relating to animals which were enacted
by the 1967 State Legislature included:

House Bill 1087 —— To require police to be notiﬁed when a
domestic animal is struck by a moror
vehicle.

H onse Bill 1091 To prohibit the sale of fowl as pets when

under three weeks of age.

House Bill 1119 To delete provisions in Maryland law

for. distributing ﬁnes to humane organi-

zations.

House Bill 44 To amend the laws on dog control in

Caroline and Worcester Counties.

House Bill 86 Legislation to enable the County Com-

missioners of Harford and Cecil Coun-

ties to enact a comprehensive system for
regulating dogs in each county and for
licensing dogs.

House Bill 399 To provide that monies derived from

dog licenses and taxes go into the gen-

eral funds and money paid for damages
by dogs. be made from the general fund

(excepting Harford and Kent Counties).

Home Bill 432 To change the remedies available in

Harford County for handling and dispos—

ing of dangerous dogs and the applica-

bility of penalties provided by law for

violation of the law regulating danger-
ous animals in the county.

Some of the bills which failed in 1967 were reintroduced in 1968
under the auspices of the Humane Society of Talbot County.

The State Health Department has elected not to become involved
in the enforcement of humane animal treatment laws. The position
of enforcement is a local concern and can besr be carried out by
local governments.

The State Health Department does believe in medical research‘and
supports research by qualiﬁed medical institutions and univerSities.

The State Health Department has acted in the case in question as
consultant to all groups which have asked for their serVices.

A review of the Five-Year Activity Plan for the State Health De-
partment found no mention of increased activities or requests for
funds in the areas of animal acquisition for research. The Depart-
ment’s Bureau of Laboratories does not have facilities for keeping
dogs and cats. The Department's cooperation has been limited to
those institutions which have Federal research grants to sap-
port animal care. These research grants have been approved by Fed-
eral agencies and are subject to regular evaluation "by Federal projecr
managers. Their facilities are inspected by the United States De-
partment of Agriculture.

During the period November 2, 1966 to January 5, 1967, letters
were written by Johns Hopkins School of Medicine ofﬁcials to
Mrs. Gladys Noon Spellman, Chairman of the County Commis«
sioners of Prince George’s County and the County Commission re-
questing condemned animals. Letters were written by:

Charles C. J. Carpenter, M.D., Chairman
Division of Infectious Diseases

George D. Zui-dema, M.D.
Professor and Direcror
Department of Surgery

Walter F. Fallinger, II, M.D.

In recent months, many animal dealers have gone out of business.
There has resulted a sharp increase in animal prices. Medical
schools claim a need for a readily available source of inexpensive
dogs and cars which meet the standard-s set forth by research proj-
ects and teaching programs. The universities have three apparent
alternatives :

1. Not to do bio-medical research which uses animals. This alter-
native has been emphatically rejected by the universities as
being detrimental to mankind.

. To use dogs and cats which have been raised for research. When
available from DEALERS, these animals now cost approximately
$75 to $300 for dogs and from $50 to $100 for cats. Institu-

; tions consider it prohibitively expensive for raising their ani-
mals since a suitable facility would necessarily be a multi-
million dollar investment. The animals used (about 30,000
dogs and cats) would ultimately cost the taxpayers over three
million dollars each year since the major portion of medical re-
search is now supported by Federal funds. The medical com-
munity believes this is far too expensive to be seriously con-
sidered at this time.

To ask more local governments to donate animals which have
been humanely kept for the holding period established by
county ordinances and which are scheduled for an immediate
killing procedure, to make these animals available to the medi-
cal schools. (About 25% of the animals needed in the State are
now being donated.) The savings of this program would allow
for continued improvement of animal care in animal facilities
and of research project design-s. At this time, staff veterinarians
who have specialized in laboratory animal care, bring pound
animals into a condition of good health and thereafter, super-
vise animal care in research projects.

0 It was found that medical school animals are humanely treated.

The Humane Society of the United States is now on record as
opposing the use of impounded animals by medical schools. The
philosophical differences of the Maryland scientiﬁc communities and

 




that expressed by the Humane Society of the United States and
various Maryland humane interests are apparent. Your State gov-
ernment hopes that man’s efforts to understand and to control dis-
ease and disability will not be impaired because of this difference.
It is. pointed out that human mﬁering will occur if these philo-
sophical arguments centered on methods of animal acquisition are
allowed to interfere with the studies of conditions which affect both
man and animals.

There are many facets of the problems faced by research scien-
tists who work with the living systems of man and animal in order
that this generation and those that follow will have beneﬁted by
our scientiﬁc concern and accomplishments.

STATE OF MARYLAND .

Mrs. Martha J. Pett
10701 Ridge Drive
Clinton, Maryland 20735
Dear Mrs. Pett:

Your concern for the humane treatment of animals is one shared
by .the Department of Health. An ad hoc committee, under the
chairmanship of the Department’s Chief of Veterinary Medicine, was
appornted by the State Legislature in 1966 to study proposed animal
care legislation. This committee, com-posed of representatives from
bio-medical institutions and humane organizations, sponsored a num-
ber of jointly-formulated bills fostering improved animal care and
control, some of which were passed by the 1967 General Assembly.

. A model ordinance has been drawn up by the Department for
guidance of local governing bodies seeking animal control laws. This
ordinance is designed to provide proper care and supervision of im-
pounded animals, and to protect pets as well as people from the
hazard of attack by vagrant, possibly diseased, animals. During 1967,
nearly 17,000 humans were treated for animal bites, according to
reports from private physicians and hospitals. The cost of medical
care can scarcely be estimated.

The ordinance adopted by the City of Baltimore in 1949, per-
mitting the donation of unclaimed animals to various medical in-
stitutions for research purposes, was carefully written to protect pets
and their owners. It provides for notiﬁcation of owners when an
impounded animal is wearing identifying tags, and a further period
of four days to claim the pets. Animals not wearing identifying tags
are also kept for four days.

Medical research investigators tell us that such major medical
advances as the "'blue baby” operation, which has saved many help-
less infants from early death, the growing success in organ trans-
plantations, the development of polio vaccine (to name only a
few), could not have been achieved without the use of animals in
the experimental stages. The raising or purchase of such animals
has become more and more expensive, and the promise of high
proﬁts has led to a "black market” operation which has cost many
an anguished owner the loss of his pet.

The Department believes that widespread adoption of such
ordinances as that now in effect in Baltimore would be of great
help in eliminating such practices, because the medical institutions
would have a ready source in animals which would otherwise be
destroyed. Animals accepted for research are kept in clean, com-
fortable surroundings, are cared for by veterinary technicians under
the supervision of a veterinarian, are fed and conditioned with
compassionate regard for their comfort and well-being, and are
assiduously spared any unnecessary pain. Whatever discomfort they
may suffer is temporary and minimal—probably far less than that
experienced by both humans and animals suffering, often without
care of any kind, from conditions these research projects are designed
to alleviate or eliminate. Surgical procedures are performed under
anesthesia, with all the pre- and post-operative care that would be
given human beings in the best hospitals.

The Department is sincerely convinced of the necessity of this
form of research, believes the donation of condemned animals would
reap enormous savings for the taxpayers of Maryland and help to do
away with the proﬁteering dealers, and further believes that an
animal or human who has contributed to better health in the future
for his own kind, has lived to more purpose than if ‘he were need-
lessly and arbitrarily destroyed.

Sincerely yours,

William J. Peeples, M.D.
Commissioner

A MEMBER STATES HER CASE!
by Mrs. Jean Hallberg

I am a resident of Prince George’s County, and I have recently
learned that the Commissioners of this county are considering selling
animals impounded by the county to medical research organizations.
I ﬁnd this idea repugnant. Such a practice somehow reminds me of
the bounty hunters in the old West that I see on TV. Only in this
case, it would not be a vicious criminal who was hunted; it would be
a poor, miserable dog which had found that, though he was a friend
to man, man was not a friend to him.

I consider it inhumane to cage, and then impregnate with dis-
ease, animals which have known love and freedom of action as pets.
It is comparable to impris-oning mentally disturbed persons, as was
done in the middle ages. Neither the dogs nor the people could ever
know the why or wherefore of their punishment.

Why are laboratory animals not bred and trained for the envir-
onment in which they will exist? They would then adapt to it nat-
urally. Any animal which leads a normal life ab‘hors conﬁnement—
even a short stay at an animal hospital is an ordeal and would be a
shocking experience were it not endured under the watchful eye of a
veterinarian or his assistant who would provide sedation if the strain
on the dog warranted it. I am convinced that no such individual at-
tention would be given a research animal, for the physical and emo-
tional reactions of the animal would be a factor in the research.

It is cruel to thrust a dog, one that has formerly led a normal
life, into inert solitary conﬁnement, to exist only as a vegetable in ani-
mal form. Were I, as a human being with a reasonable amount of
intelligence, placed in such a state, I would not be rational for long——
I would lapse into a state of idiocy. Since animals cannot speak or
read, nor judge the future by the present, I, and all animal lovers,
must speak for them. Are the county managers so embroiled in ambi-
tious political matters that they have lost sight of ordinary human
compassion for the helpless, in this case, animal life?

It is my understanding that the Prince George's Animal Shelter
(a shelter?) will negotiate for the sale of the animals they impound,
but WHO gains ﬁnancially by this sordid business venture is not
clear.

My concern is not only about dogs acquired from the pound by
people who cannOt adequately care for them, and consequently let
them run at large until they are impounded again—I am also becom-
ing perturbed about the safety of cherished pets. If Prince George’s
County is actively going into the business of impounding dogs and
other animals and then selling them, where will the line be drawn?
Oh yes, of course, "If the dog is wearing identiﬁcation tags, the owner
will be notiﬁed.” But suppose a family pet which always wears identi-
ﬁcation tags has strayed quite by chance and is impounded reportedly
without tags? The question would be, did he get caught in some
brush and freed himself by slipping out of his collar (worn loosely
to avoid choking to death in this type of mishap), or was the collar
lost in the struggle to capture him—who is to say for certain whether
he lost his collar before or after impoundment? My anxiety was fur-
ther increased when I was informed by another animal lover: "T he
research people do not want half-starved stray animals which often
are already sick; they want healthy, well-cared-for dogs which are
regularly examined by a veterinarian.”

I write this letter in the interest of all dogs, whether they be
pets or strays, and because I want all dog lovers in Prince George's
County to be apprised of a situation that could very easily result in
impounding and selling the wrong dogs.

We reproduce here an advertisement that was published in the Prince
George Sentinal newspaper in an attempt to ﬁght the Pound Seizure
Proposal. It tells more of the story:

PROTECT YOUR PET

Who May Become A Stray

On August 12, 1968, the Animal Control Commission is considering
a proposal which would permit the Prince G. Cty Animal Shelter to
sell the impounded animals to laboratories for experimentation. The
PGHS, Inc. is unal-terably and adamantly opposed to such disposition
of household pets which come under the care of the Prince Georges
Animal Shelter. We feel that such action on the part of the county
would be a breach of public trust and faith. The $200,000.00 Prince
Georges Animal Shelter is being paid for 'by the taxpayers and was
established to ernder services to the taxpayers of this county and offer
protection to the animals impounded there. We were never led to be-
lieve that it would be a laboratory procurement center. The proposal
attempts to obtain "SELECTED” animals, which would indicate that
the paramount need is quality not quanitity. This would strongly sug-
gest that our household pets would be in jeopardy. Under present
management, very little effort is made to locate the owners of their
charges. There have been numberous complaints regarding this inade-
quate service. The fact that the laboratories in this state would obtain
animals from our shelter would in no way alter the number of ani-
mals dognapped. The stolen animals are transported to laboratories in
other states.

Research animals should be of known quality and health to achieve
ultimate goals in research. An unlimited supply is a burden on tax-
payers due to the death of animals in experimentation from pre-exist-
ing diseases and needless repetitious experimentation.

rDog Catching

Has Become
Rich Racket

{The Dog lift: triers Cgiiih’s first meeting
ot‘the new season held at the Overseas
Press Club prov ed a shocker. Joan Brearly,
editor of Pepular Dogs, pulled no punches

g in her, speechon “Pets, Pounds and Po-
liticians".”9 , _ _

AcCording" to Miss Brearly, the once
lowly dog catcher is now rapidly becom-

_ ing rich. Here’s how it works. ‘ _

,A. man bLiysjhimsfelf a truck and con-

» tracts with a; number of Village; to keep
their streets free from stray ,nima for
an extremely low figure, somet mg like
$1,500. per year. The town board is de-
lighted. Saves money for the taxpayers
and it does not have to maintain a shel-
ter. ' .

The man rounds up the strays, loads
them on a truck and proceeds to the
nearestﬂresearch laboratggyﬁwhere he dis-

posesﬂof'them‘at fromm$2 to$40 per dog.

No food, no shelter just a qurck trip in
the truck, almost 100 per cent profit.

By and by some dog owners begin to
ask about their lost pets.

The man is hard .to find, usually a box
number or an answering servic. Com-
‘plaints start coming in to the town boards.
With the kind of money he is making the
dog catcher can afford to pay to stay in
business and he does.

Miss Brearly claims to have the facts
on several such procedures in out-of—state
communities.

The club members are in for some on
politics at the next meeting on Nov. 13,
when State Senator John D. Caemmerer
will tell why he felt it necessary to intro
duce a bill designed to protect do‘g buyers

from sellers. ”,3;

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

I very much wish to read two pamphlets
published by The Universities Federation for Animal
welfare. I have written to them and Major Hume has
put in a reminder for me, all to no avail.

If you happen to have these brochures
a would you loan them to me for reading and quick re-
;turn? They are:

The Scientific Basis of Kindness to An—
imals. By John R. Baker. 11 pp. Listed as gratis.

”Mtk'”*icf3 The Sense of Pain in.Animals, by G. C.
Grindley. lOpp. 3d.

I know that UFAW has moved and it is
true that I wrote to their London address, but
still...

I have completed my article on the
rodeo and it has been accepted with enthusiasm
by AMERICAN HERITAGE.

Sincerely yours,

Gerald Carson

P.S. If you cannot help me on this request, can you
direct me to any other material on the tOpics indica~
ted by the pamphlet titles?

I hope that the presentation of

off in fine style and that the printer was able
to supply the additional quantity needed of the
Annual Report.

When I got home I found the invita-
tion and Report in my mail. So I am covered in
that regard. There was also the excellent letter
from the Society for Animal Protection, which I
am joining.

I regret that I was unable to work
further in your files which are beyond any praise
I can offer. The stiches resulting from my acci-
dent are to come out today. I look back gaa tefully
to the fruitful day spent among your recordE and
to your helpfulness.

Sincerely yours,

Dear hrs. Stevens,

It was very kind of you to remember me after so many months,
and I appreciate your invitation to the Schweitzer award
ceremonies for Dr. Quinn. Your letter was forwarded

to me from the Star.

I find I will be unable to attend, unfortunately, much
as I'd like to come.

I came across a development last month in Hanford, Washington
while on a trip for the Atomic Energy Commission that might
be of interest to you. They have had considerable success

in ABC laboratories there developing a miniature porker for
use as a laboratory test animal. They have, by some rather
sophisticated Mendelian tinkering, come up with a variety
weighing around 150 pounds at maturity, compared with 600

or more pounds for the conventional type.

The significance of all this is that if they continue in this
direction, some day they may be able to eliminate the use

of beagles in laboratory testing. I know this sounds bizarre,
but the pig actually is a better animal in several ways because
its physiological make-up resembles that of man much more
closely, so the tests are more meaningful. The handicap in the
past has been its cumbersome size.

Due to the budget stringencies that have affected so much
research this year, the work on further breeding of so ~ called
"Hanford miniatures" has been halted. I think it's a shame,
and I wish Congress could be persuaded either to restore the
funding or transfer the work to some agency such as Agriculture
where it could continue. Frankly, my own interest in this

is simply to set the beagles out of the laboratories, but

in an.abstract way, I think it would be interesting if a
@Ompound porker could be develOped too.

This is probably the strangest response you'll get this season

to a cocktail invitation, but at least you have to admit it's

Original. Perhaps some day we can talk about it further.
Bestwregards,m

Mrs. Christine Stevens

Washington, D.C. 20007

 
   
     
     
 

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Your letter dated 26 September which

.....

  
 

reached me yesterday: But in spite of the post of-
fice, all worked out fine.

    
   

 
 

Meanwhile, I have sent to you a copy
of Natural History, with an article on vegetarian-
ism which is perhaps tangential from your point of
View. Some of it may be of interest, however.

   

 

    
   
 
  

Enclosed you will find a tentative out—
line of my book which will perhaps stimulate sug~
gestions on your part. I hope so. It is by no means
all set or frozen. I should not like this to be
widely disseminated. Yet if you see some good rea-
son to show it, I do not want to prevent that. I
trust your discretion.

       
 
   
     
   
 
 

I look forward with anticipation to re-
ceiving the results of the notes you took as we
talked. You spoke about material you have in IJash-
ington which you tho 1ght would be useful. I have
fumbled this. That is, it isn't sharp in my mem-
ory. would you be kind enough to repeat?

   
    
 
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
  
 
  

Two more questions:

Do you have anything on the effects of
the Vietnam.war on the native animals? I have a
few short, but interesting, items from gas Egg
York Times.

Would you recommend that I subscribe
to La Vie des Betes? I am.not familiar with the
editorial policy. again'with my warm thanks,

 

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

I was very pleased to receive your let-
ter and should like very much to talk with.you when
you are in New‘York. I have delayed writing until
some of my own plans took shape as I live well be—
yonasie commuting area.

Below I give some dates when I expect
to be in New York:

September 18. After 11 a.m.
September 19. All day
September 25. All day.

September 26. After a morning doctor's
appointment.

Perhaps one of these dates will fit in
with your plans. If not, I shall try again. I indi-
cated some of the topics of interest to me, in my
17 August letter to Mrs. Bemelmans, and there are
others, of course.

The Information Reports you were kind
enough to send to me were very useful. Could I have

Lab People Might Be Better
Testing Fodder Than Animals

By JOHN ANKENBRUCK
lThese people who work in
laboratories. g i V i n g shocks
to little animals worry me, but
they do”'é.'o'r'ﬁ”é““{3b with some in—
teresting reac- g;
tions.

T h e closer
you look at
their reports,
the more it
seems the lab
people m i g h t
be better test
fodder than the
animals.

In the charter
issue of a new
magazine, Psy— H
chology Today, John
an article en— Ankenbruck
titled “Pain and Aggression”
appears.

This is one of these deals
Where they have rats, snakes,
opossums, monkeys and even
doves in cages to see what
happens when they put th e
juice to them. The test cages
have wire bottoms so
the animals get the shocks in
the feet. Very scientific.

Anyway, there are two rats
in a cage. When one gets a
shock, he will attack the other
rat every time. If there is no
other rat in the cage, the ani—
mal has no choice but to sit
there and take it.

By putting a rat and a snake
in the same cage, a rather
strange result was reported.

Every time a rat was given
a shock, it would attack th e
snake; even though the snake
would ‘quickly retaliate
by killing the rat. The lab peo-
ple concluded that given suf-
ficient pain, a rat will turn ag-
gressive and attack anything
within reach. '

“First we found that this re—
sponse occurred in many dif-
ferent strains of rats. Then we
found that shock produced at-
tack when pairs of the follow-
ing species were caged togeth~
er: mice, hamsters, opos»
sums, raccoons, marmosets,
foxes, nutrias, cats, snapping
turtles, squirrel monkeys, fer-
rets, red squirrels, an amphib-
ian and several species of
snakes including the boa con-
strictor, rattlesnake” and oth-
ers, they said.

They even found pain would
lead to attacks on tennis balls
and a bitometer, which en-
abled the testors to time the
whole thing better.

The lab people also found
that psychological pain worked

too..They used hungry pigeons.
The birds were trained to peck
at a disk by getting a few
pieces of grain for the effort.
When, however, the pecking
was not followed by grain, the
pigeon would fly into a rage
and attack the other pigeon in
the cage. This drew the com-
ment that the test was “evi-
dence to suggest that with-

.. cut down or stopped,

drawing reward is equivalent
to physical pain.”

They couldn’t resist compar-
ing the animal behavior to
human beings, though they ap-
parently failed to find any hu-
man volunteers to undergo the
shocks.

“Since this sort of psycholog-
ical pain seems to be more
common in human experience
than are extremes of physi-
cal pain, these finds may help '
us understand some of the
mechanisms which produce ag-
gression in man. Being scold-

ed, being fired from a job or
expelled from school, losing a
sexual partner, running out of
gas, having one’s allowance
losing
money to a vending machine,
being thwarted by a stuck
door —- who has not expe-
rienced these noxious events
and felt like kicking the door,
taking a hammer to the vend-
ing machine, or just smashing
the n e a r e s t thing,” the re-
searchers reported.

They seem to have missed
the point that if you kick that
machine hard enough, some-
times you get your dime back.

In other studies, the lab peo-
ple found the caged animals, if
given a way of avoiding the
shocks, will take it. This is
hardly surprising and is the
sort of thing most anyone could
have told them before the
elaborate laboratory business.
