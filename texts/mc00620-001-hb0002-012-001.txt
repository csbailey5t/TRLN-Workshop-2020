Pointing up to the silent skies, 1‘22: -
The glittering steeples of churches rise if M7 27L »
And tongues of silver in w01ds of chimes
Proclaim the era of Christian times.

From lofty pulpit to cushioned pew

(To torpid many and listening few)

The moral precept and orthodox creed

Go forth, and the sinner is urged to heed.
With serious faces and pleading air

Millions of worshippers kneel in prayer;
They pray for virtues, they pray for pelf;
They pray for the heathen, they pray for self;
They pray for the sorrowing, sick and sad;
They pray for the tempted, they pray for the bad;
They pray for the ending of crime and sin;
But never a prayer for our dumb kin;
Never a sermon from pious lip

0f rich man’s check rein and driver’s whip.
Never a protest or pleading word

For the tortured creatures of ﬂock and herd.

Dimes and dollars are freely given

To coax the pagan to Christian heaven.

Yet the crime of cruelty walks abroad
Through the opulent land of a Christian God—
The God whose sympathy reached to all,

Who noted even the sparrow’s fall.

Preach, 0 pastor, and pray, 0 priest,

Send your messages to West and East;

Be voice for the voiceless and speech for the dumb,
Till the Spirit of Love to the earth shall come.
Carve this motto in each young mind;

“Who seeks salvation must ﬁrst be kind.”

“The age of chivalry is never past so long as
there IS a wrong left unredressed on earth, or a
man or woman left to say, ‘I will redress that

wrong or spend my life in the atte1npt.”’——
Charles Ifingley.
