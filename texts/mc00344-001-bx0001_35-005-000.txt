MIND YOUR MONEY

 

A Feast of Feisty Littlelouruals

BY PETER WEAVER

Have you ever had trouble with your landlord?

Have you ever wondered what you should do if your tax
return is audited?

Have you ever wondered how safe that nuclear energy
plant is on the other side of town? _ -

If you’ve wanted answers to questions like these, you’ll

be interested in a new catalog of 103 publications put out r

by citizens’ action groups and consumer organizations.

You’ll rarely find these periodicals in official guides or in
your library, but you will find lawyers, scientists, tax ex—
perts, nuclear physicists, nutritionists and others writing
about all sorts of subjects that affect your health and pock-
etboolc

Airline Passengers’ Rights
Here are some samples:

——News From ACAP. This quarterly newsletter is pub-
lished by the Aviation Consumer Action Project, which
concerns itself with looking after airline passengers’
rights. You get information on how to find honest charter
flights, how to cope with lost or damaged baggage and how
to bump back when bumped off a flight.

~—Alternative Sources of Energy is a bimonthly journal
that talks about solar, wind and wood energy resources.
You get details on such topics as how to build your own so-
lar hot water heater and how to build your own wind gen-
erator.

”Network: The Paper for Parents. This tabloid paper
comes out during the school year and addresses itself to
helping parents get a better education for their children. It
has articles on the problems of single parents, handicapped
children and what parent organizations are doing.

”Pension Facts are pamphlets put out by the Pension
Rights Center. You get information on how to evaluate
your pension, pension rights for women and how to set up
IRA (individual Retirement Account) and Keogh (for
self -employed) retirement plans.

—-—Gray Panther Network. Published by the Gray Pan-
thers, this newspaper shows how elderly groups get tax
reform, nursing home reform, better housing, jobs after re-
tirement and better interest rates on savings accounts.

For Lovers of Animals

——lnformation Report is of special interest to lovers of
domestic and wild animals. Each issue contains articles on
such things as “the whale killers” and what you can do
about them, problems with the importation and sale of wild
birds and problems with “factory farming” methods.

——Critical Mass Journal is for people who are worried
about the safety of nuclear energy plants. This monthly
journal was right on top of the Three Mile Island nuclear

: ' Richard C. Hntle?

There has been a discussion in my
house about the correct name of a news
reporter on CBS Radio Station 88 at.
noon. Is his name Richard C. Hutle?

E...,JM SeaGirt

The CBS radio neWs correspondent 1s
Richard C. Hottelet.

Podiatrist needed

My daughter needs a surgeon to oper-
ate on a bunion on her foot. On looking
at the telephone classified pages, I have
been unable to find a podiatrist doing
this kind of work. Would you please lo-
cate the nearest doctor doing this work.

Mrs. L.F., Ocean Township

You could telephone the public rela-
tions office of a hospital and ask for the
names of three or four surgeons who
operate at the hospital.

The New Jersey Podiatry Society,
Cherry Hill, is sending you the names of
two doctors of podiatric medicine locat-
ed near you Irving J. Decker, executive
director of the society, suggests that you
first call the doctors, describe your
daughter’s condition and ask if the doc-
tor performs the required procedure.

Press price right

At the time I bought a door, I asked
the salesman if a sale was coming. If
there was to be a sale, I could have
waited to get the door. His answer was
negative.

I just saw an add in the Press, and
the door was $143 instead of the $162 I
paid. Maybe you can do something as I
didn’t get any satisfaction.

R.C., Ocean Township

4 The building center is sending you a
$19. 41 check to reimburse you. ‘

The president of the company says
the door actually was On sale at the time
‘7' ‘yombought-vthe door, *but apparently the
salesman didn’t realize that. The presi-
dent says if you had contacted him or
the ‘manager the matter would have
been settled without delay. ,

Security increase

I have two problems both dealing
with the corporation which is my land-
lord. I got a statement from the bank
holding my security deposit, and I have
not received intest on it. Also, my, rent
was increased from $245 to $260, and I
was asked to add to the amount of my
security deposit. I am not Sure of legal
rights m a case like this.

F.S., Toms River

1 When you inquires about you legal
rights, a lawyer is the one to consult for
,, such information.

It appears from your letter that the
interest is credited to your name once a
year. The New Jersey Tenants Organiza-
tion, Box 1142, Fort Lee, says a tenant is
entitled to have interest from a security
deposit credited to rent at the time the
lease is renewed or at any time during
the term of the lease. If the interest is
not Credited toward rent, the tenant is
entitled to a cash refund. The Tenants
Organization says tenants rights in this
respect are outlined clearly in NJ SA

‘ Theodore Easton of the state Ofﬁce
of Wage and Hour Compliance, Trenton,
suggests that you file in a small claims
court to recover the monies claimed by
you.

He contacted the president of the
food products company and was inform-
ed that you three worked as independent
contractors. The company president is
sending copies of your three contracts to
the Office of Wage and Hour Compliance
as evidence that your positions were as
independent contractors. The state office
doesn’t have jurisdiction over independ-
ent contractors.

Pension due?

Well, here I am again. This time it is
about my late husband who died in 1974.
He was a member of the International
'I‘ypographical Union, and friends tell me
i may be entitled to pension benefits. I
wouid greatly appreciate it if you would
inquire for me. My husband’s last job
was in Westfield.

Mrs. Fit, Manchester Township

Carle E. Hatton, administrator of the
International Typographical Union, Colo-
rado Springs, 001., says benefits from
the ITU pension plan result from em-
ployer contributions, if there are any.

Hatton says the pension fund receiv-
ed no contributions from any of your
husband’s employers, and therefore he
wasn’t eligible for pension from ITU and
neither are his survii or“ riatton says
that apparently your husband was em-
ployed in a place whiCh didn’t provide
for employer contributions to the union
pension fund.

Hatton says you can write to him if

you have further questions. His address
is being forwarded to you. .

Pieces reshipped

I bought a kit to make a miniature

The Tenants Organization says yourig
rent increase is about five percent which
is within allowable increases. A landlord

is entitled to one and a half times the p

amount of rent as security , which may
be proportionately increased with rent.

I Try Small claims

We worked for a company demon-
strating food products. We have been
waiting a year for the company to pay us
money earned. We have called a woman
at the company Several times, and she
says she never received money from the
company to pay us. Would you look into
the matter?

Where can I sell an old Kodak cam-
era. It is the bellows type and is 58 years
old and still takes beautiful pictures.

Mrs. M3,, Point Pleasant?

You could try a classiﬁed ad in The

might consult Nathan Lipman, president

Their Significance and Source

«W E ARE living in one of the ﬂood
tides of world history. One of
the problems raised by this situation is
that of keeping up with the surging trend
of events.

“As supplements to standard texts,
teachers are more and more turning to
the many excellent pamphlets now avail-
able. The advantages 01 such material
are numerous. The pamphlets are more
up-to-date than the formal textbooks.
They are usually written in a popular
style and attractively printed. They add
interest and variety to the usual class-
room reference books.” —— The Civic

Their Signiﬁcance in
Curriculum Improvement

School curriculum enrichment is of unprecedented impor-
tance and signiﬁcance. The immediate future will mark the
initiation and execution of vital and far reaching plans by gov-
ernment and industry. One of the major needs in the improve—
ment and enrichment of the school curriculum is that of bring—
ing boys and girls in close touch with the events that are
actually happening in the world around them.

There are many ways in which educators can meet the
demands of curriculum improvement. Some of the most valu—
able means of achieving this end are the radio, the ﬁlm, news—
papers, magazines, and the thousands of publications and ex-
hibits that are made available to schools without cost by fed—
eral and state agencies, private foundations, and industrial
and commercial concerns. The materials available through
the EDUCATORS INDEX OF FREE MATERIALS include
maps, bulletins, pamphlets, exhibits, charts, books, magazines,
transcriptions, radio scripts, and other items that can be had

for the asking and may become the property of the school or
may be borrowed for appropriate periods of use.

Why Are Free Materials Worthy of
Use in Schools?

Sometimes the question is raised as to why materials
that are available without cost are worthy of use in schools.
An excellent answer to this question is given by Dr. Thomas
H. Briggs, as follows:

“No intelligent person can go over a mass of materials
furnished by commercial concerns without wishing that he had
the time to satisfy aroused interest and to extend his own edu-
cation by reading carefully many of the books and pamphlets.
They tell the story of the origin processing, distribution, and
uses of steel, nickel, copper, aluminum, asbestos, marble, gran-
ite, limestone, asphalt, concrete, and oil; of cotton, wool, flax,
silk, and new textile fibers; of rubber, cork, the woods, and
other useful materials; of practically all kinds of clothing, and
of its selection, manufacture, care and cleaning; of. nearly all
human foods —- salt, sugar, spices, wheat, corn, the small
cereals, coffee and tea, cocoa and chocolate, milk, cheese, citrus
fruits, apples, .pears, peaches, and prunes — and of their selec—
tion, preparation, preservation, and serving; of all of the com-

mon food animals —- cattle, sheep, swine, chickens, ﬁsh, and
oysters _—-- claSSiﬁed as to their kinds and nutritive values, with
instructions for their buying, breeding care, marketing, and
preparation for the table; of the furnishing and care of the
home, and of the machines and materials used in it -- refrigera-
tors, ‘ vacuum cleaners, air conditioning units, heating and
lighting equipment, means of preventing and extinguishing
ﬁres, of carpets and rugs, glass and china ware, stoves and
ranges, cooking utensils, and gadgets for the kitchen; of how
to keep well, avoid accidents and prolong life; of machinery
of almost every imaginable kind —-— pumps, turbines, steam and
internal combustion and Diesel engines, carburetors, batteries,
dry cells, transformers, thermostats, thermometers, barom-
eters, microsc0pes, telescopes, cameras; of reapers and com-
bines; of communication -—— telephones, radio, printing, paper,
pens, pencrls, and typewriters; of budgeting, banking, saving
money, making investments, and selecting insurance. In short,
business [governmental agencies and private foundations] has
prepared and is offering to schools free of cost or at nominal
charges material on almost all conceivable phases of life with
which current education is attempting to acquaint youth.” *

X ,What the INDEX is and How it Works

The INDEX is an annotated schedule of free materials
which have signiﬁcant educational value. The sources from
which free materials may be obtained are varied and large in
number. They include departments of the federal govern-
ment, state agencies, chambers of commerce, travel bureaus,
private foundations, and many of our major industrial con-
cams.

As can be seen from the Table of Contents, the organiza-
tion of the INDEX follows largely the subject-matter break-
down found in most state and city courses of study. Yet it is
sufficiently ﬂexible to permit continuous synchronization with
a constantly shifting curriculum and curricular emphasis.

Because of the heavy assignments in other directions, it
is impossible for the individual school administrators, super-
visors, and classroom teachers to become familiar with free
materials that are available. Consequently, the EDUCA—
TORS INDEX OF FREE MATERIALS has been organized
in order that educators may be familiar with what is available
from contemporary governmental, industrial, and business
institutions. The INDEX gives educators a convenient and
easy means of getting such materials for use in their class-
rooms.

Editorship and Selection of Materials

The INDEX is edited by a recognized educator, Dr. John
Guy Fowlkes, Charles Anderson, Professor of Education, Uni-
versity of Wisconsin, and Director Wisconsin Improvement
Assoc1ation and Paul T. Cody, M. A. The editors examine
nearly twice as many materials as they list in the INDEX. The
items listed in the INDEX represent a selection of from ﬁfty to
sixty percent of the materials which the editors examine. In
each revision, all new titles are starred. No items are listed
without speciﬁc permission from the agency, institution, or
concern which furnishes the materials.

The History of the INDEX

The first edition of the INDEX appeared in March 1937.
At its birth, the INDEX was a modest, 80-page volume.

There were five revisions, making a total of six editions, in .

1937. Since its humble beginning and limited use in 1937,
some 100,000 people scattered throughout the United States,
and indeed, the world, have used the INDEX. Some Sub-
scribers to the INDEX have now been using it for thirty
years.

Learning Re’Deﬁned

Dr. Roy M. Hall suggests that we should re-define learn-
ing in order to make it possible for media to contribute more
effectively to education: .

“Learning is not just a matter of transmitting informa-
tion from one agent, the teacher, to another agent, the learner.
As long as learning is conceived in such limited terms the new
media will be used for just as limited purposes . . . .Learnlng
is a matter of cognition, perception, discovery, realization of
self, understanding fundamental issues, distinguishing be-
tween classes of things, seeing patterns and relationships, and
cause and effect. How much difference would it make 1n 0111'
planning the use of new media if we define learmng in these
terms rather than simply as accumulation of knowledge and

facts? . . . .”"'

a M.
‘ Assmtant Commissioner for Research, U. S. Ofﬁce of Education, Dr. ROY
Hall, at Seattle DAVI Convention, second general session, 1959, speaking on the

implementation of Title VII, as quoted in June 1959 issue, AUDIOVISUAL
INSTRUCTION.

Areas in Which the INDEX is
Particularly Helpful

The EDUCATORS INDEX OF FREE MATERIALS will
prove of great help to superintendents, principals, supervisors,
librarians, and teachers. Superintendents, principals, and
supervisors will ﬁnd it valuable in formulating policies and in
organizing teacher-training programs. The materials that can
be obtained through the EDUCATORS INDEX OF FREE
MATERIALS will be of inestimable help especially in:

1. Improving the Curriculum by

a. keeping the school curriculum up—to—date,

b. making the school more realistic by keeping the cur-
riculum in constant contact with developments of
social and industrial importance,

0. establishing and maintaining curriculum laboratory-
libraries;

2. Improving Teachers’ Work in
a. preparing teaching units,
b. organizing an activity program,
c. develOping a good bulletin board program,
d. providing for individual differences; and

3. Improving Pupils’ Work by
a. stimulating pupil interest,
b. giving pupils the opportunity and means of doing
things for themselves.

Improving the Curriculum

Excellent as textbooks of today are, it is impossible for the
regular textbook to stay up—to-date and reach the classroom
as quickly as is needed. The world charter, EurOpean re-
construction, foreign loans, world trade, industrial peace,
nuclear energy, aerospace travel and exploration, and other
breathtaking social and scientific phenomena are appearing
too fast to be included in textbooks that are more than a few
months in print. Consequently, by supplementing the regu-
lar text, the materials in the INDEX prove invaluable.

The indictment is sometimes made that schools are too
far removed from affairs of actual everyday life. This accusa-
tion is not nearly so well founded as was formerly the case,

___5__

 




but schools could and should keep the curriculum closely in
touch with contemporary life. As was implied in the discus-
sion above, the use of materials obtainable through the
INDEX will do much to refute this indictment of the school
curriculum.

Good teachers are always on the alert for curriculum
laboratory-library materials. The experience of a class at the
University of Iowa during the summer session of a few years
ago is a striking illustration of the possibilities of establishing
a curriculum laboratory-library from the materials made
available by governmental and industrial concerns. This class
collected free materials which were displayed in a room forty
by twelve feet and the materials obtained ﬁlled the available
space.

Improving the Teachers’ Work

The materials available through the INDEX will be
invaluable to teachers in preparing teaching units; organizing
activity programs; selecting, organizing and directing good
bulletin board exhibits; and providing for individual differ-
ences among pupils.

The development of effective teaching units and the or-
ganization of sound activity programs depends to a high de-
gree upon the diversity and the amount of supplementary
text materials that are used. Individual pupil and pupil-
committee assignments around such things as scrapbooks, ex—
hibits, and talks can be greatly improved by the use of ma-
terials available through the INDEX.

One of the things which has increased in importance in
the school program during the past few years is the bulletin
board. Despite the improvement in this direction, there are
far too few teachers who utilize the bulletin board to'anything
approaching its potentiality. Here again the INDEX can be
of inestimable help.

Providing for individual differences has been one of the
most emphasized aspects of a good curriculum and good teach-
ing practice during recent years. In a very real sense, one of
the strongest justiﬁcations for the organization of activity pro-
grams and committee and individual pupil assignments is that
such practices are effective means of providing for pupil dif-
ferences. Consequently, here again the INDEX proves val-
uable in meeting one of the most serious and perplexing prob
lems in the life of the classroom teacher.

“We must remember that textbooks, however valuable are peculiarly and
almost completely connected with going to school. No one ever heard of
people reading textbooks when they were no longer in school or connected
with school. We don’t develop the habit of reading texts. But we must
and can develop the habit of keeping up with what’s happening in the
world by regularly reading contemporary material. It’s our chief way of
continuing our education when school days are over.”

THE COMPELLING NEED FOR LIVE
CURRICULUM MATERIALS

Within the last two decades virtually all leading authorities
in curriculum development and enrichment have given effective
encouragement and substantial support for the use of current
materials to supplement the text.

There currently exists, therefore, a positive recognition of
the fact that the curriculum must be liberated from the rigidi-
ties which resulted from the lack of new curriculum materials
to supplement the text. The curriculum must be expanded to
include movements, events, techniques and products that are
developed in, are applicable to, and form an integral part of the
society in which we live.

A signiﬁcant example of this liberation and expansion of the
curriculum is evident in the growth and development of cur-
rent Audiovisual Education Programs.

With the expansion of the curriculum, teachers are called
upon to do a bigger job, in less time, for more students, with
more varied experience, talents and objectives. Dr. John W.
Studebaker, in a recent issue of the Scholastic Magazine, points
out an effective orientation to meet our resulting obligations:

“The orientation must be always toward the present, since
we seek to develop citizens for modern life rather than clois-
tered scholars. That orientation to the present cannot be
achieved by textbooks alone, basically important as they are
and however recent their adoption. The tempo of modern
events is too swift. The best and most recent textbooks
should be used, of course; but they need to be supplemented

by a more ﬂexible means of recording and reporting the
current scene.

The mythical teacher with time to spare could conceivably
assemble Clippings, bring in magazines and newspapers from
the news-stand, assign radio listening, and by other means bring
the current 0f contemporary life into the classroom. But let

us be realistic. Teachers now do as much as possible within
the limits of time and human endurance.”

‘HOW TO GET THE MATERIALS YOU
NEED FOR CURRICULUM
ENRICHMENT

The EDUCATORS INDEX OF FREE MATERIALS is pub-
lished in response to the insistent demands from educators for
a service which lists and classiﬁes the best free curriculum
materials which are currently available to schools. It is a
service tailored by educators to the needs of educators. It is
authoritative and easy to use. All new titles are starred (*)
in each revision.

.. _ The acid test of any service of this type is not what the

publishers say about it, but how does it stand up under the

crucibles of critical examination and constant use. What do

those who use the service think about it? Fortunately, many of

those who used the INDEX reported how the INDEX is meet-

ing their current requirements for free curriculum materials.

A few of the reports follow:

BLANCHE REA, Principal of Ambridge School, 4th and Ells-
worth Streets, Gary, Indiana.

“We have thoroughly enjoyed your service and hope to renew

it next year. It is a great saver for small schools, such as ours.”

R. R. VANCE, Supervisor, Division of High Schools, State De-
partment of Education, Nashville, Tennessee.

“It is my considered opinion that no progressive library can

be without this INDEX. The money paid for the INDEX will

make it possible for you to secure 10 times the value in free

materials.”

FRANCIS E.SLAGLE, Supt, Seneca Cons. Schools, Fenton, 1a.:

“We have used the EDUCATORS INDEX three years. If the

materials we have obtained through the INDEX were bought

outright, they would have cost at least ten times as much as

the INDEX.”

FRANK FISCHER, City Superintendent of Schools, Circle-
ville, Ohio:

“The EDUCATORS INDEX OF FREE MATERIALS is con-

sidered by the writer to be the best educational purchase he

has ever heard of.”

OTTO H. H. PETERSEN, Principal, Scappoose Grade School,
Scappoose, Oregon:

“We thank you for this information, and are happy to advise

that the ﬁle . . . is very useful to all schools.”

E. H. RUPRECHT, Principal, Christian Day School, Addison,
Illinois:

.“The EDUCATORS INDEX OF FREE MATERIALS . . . has

arrived and our teachers want to commend you for an out-

standing job.”

SISTER RUTH MARY, Sisters of St. Benedict, St. Peter Con-
vent, Browerville, Minn.:

“Thus far we have been very much pleased with the service

provided through the use of your INDEX.”

JOHN RUSH POWELL, Assistant Superintendent, St. Louis,
Missouri:

“In my opinion the ‘INDEX’ belongs in every high school

library.”

PAUL WRIGHT, Prin. State Industrial School, Waukesha,
Wisconsin:

“We exhaust the materials in the INDEX every year. We feel

that we get many times the cost of the INDEX in materials.”

LALE SCOFIELD, Superintendent, Silver Creek, Nebraska:
“Our EDUCATORS INDEX is in almost constant use . . . I
feel that it has paid for itself many times.”

F. K. HUGHES, Principal, Benton, Louisiana: . ’
“The EDUCATORS INDEX SYSTEM has been in use by my
entire grade school faculty. The teachers praise it highly.”

WAYNE R. CAMPBELL, Acquisitions Librarian, Colorado
State College of Education, Greeley:

“The Educators Progress Service is a well established ﬁrm and

its director, Dr. Fowlkes, has a secure reputation in the ﬁeld

of education. Some rival indexing services are on the market

which do not carry an equal assurance of dependability.”

J. MURRAY LEE, Professor of Elementary Education, Univer-
sity of Miami, Florida:

“I have observed the work which has gone into keeping the

INDEX up-to-date. The carefulness and tho-roughness with

which this is done makes it a most valuable educational tool.”

F. E. MUELLER, Supt. Independence Public Schools, Inde-
pendence, Iowa: ‘

“We conservatively estimate the materials received during the

last school year to be worth in the neighborhood of $60.”

J. WillglRKBRIDE, Supt. Cache County School District, Logan,

“This is to certify that we have used the EDUCATORS INDEX
for three years and ﬁnd it one of the best sources of supple-

4




,mentary material that it has been our pleasure to have. It
furnishes quick and available information on most any and
-every ﬁeld of education.”

WALTER WILLIAMS, JR., Tulare City Schools, Lincoln School,
' Tulare, California:

“I have had the opportunity to examine one of your indexes
and I personally feel that it is a key to good teaching in any
school system in America.”

MRS. L. L. HANCOCK, Thompsonburg School, Box 131, Bel-
_ lows Falls, Vermont:

“I have certainly enjoyed the INDEX and often wonder how I
ever taught without one. School at best is apt to be a boredom
for children, and I found that with the free materials, the
children sat up, took notice and remarked, ‘There is more to
school than the daily grind of 3 R’s. This year, I have learned
a whale of a lot more. Thanks, Mrs. Hancock’. ”

Leaders in School Curriculum Development
urge the use of live curriculum materials:

FARGO, L. F. The Library in the School. American Library
Association, p. 247-250. (LIBRARY CURRICULUM STUD-
IES, prepared under the direction of W. W. Charters):

“It may be urged that it is not so essential for the school to

have on its shelves a great many government publications as

it is to know they exist and where to get them . . . '

“Even the tiniest library may have its ﬁles of pamphlets and

clippings. Such materials cost next to nothing in money, and

as reference aids they are invaluable. They have been called

‘short-cuts for the busy’ .....

The range of pamphlet material is endless.”

GREER, M. R. “Visual aids and the school library,” Wilson
Bulletin 10:573:

“It is obviously a poor library that has no magazines, news-

papers or pamphlets.”

THE SOCIAL STUDIES CURRICULUM —-- 14th Yearbook,
Department of Superintendence, Page 348:

Some Guiding Principles of Curriculum Construction —— “The

teacher should make available for pupil use as large and as

rich a collection of materials for study as possible.”

EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS IN INSTRUCTION, P. 287-—
“Meagerness of equipment should not justify a teacher’s sur-
render to conditions. A few postage stamps can be used in
procuring materials and equipment that will serve to place
social studies teaching on a level far superior to the question-
and-answer textbook type of procedure heretofore employed.”

THE TEACHING OF READING — A Second Report, 36th

tins, and similar materials containing indispensable infor-
mation 1n adequate detall.”

CASWELL, H. L. & CAMPBELL, D. S. -- Curriculum

Reviewers and Users of the Index voice
their enthusiastic approval:

“If you want information about a very valuable service for
schools and libraries called EDUCATORS INDEX OF FREE

Progress Service, Randolph, Wisconsin.”

THE GRADE TEACHER

  

“The Index is used in schools throughout the United States.
It is constantly in the process of revision.”

THE BULLETIN, published by National
Association of Secondary-School Principals

“The EDUCATORS INDEX OF FREE MATERIALS gives
clear proof that schools do more than give lip service to the
oft-heard doctrine of ‘enriching the curriculum’. ” ‘

“The EDUCATORS INDEX is more than a useful tool to
schools. It is a valuable stimulus to starting a school library.
Moreover, it offers a challenge to the health profession to see
to it that good free material is made available to the schools
covering the whole ﬁeld of health education.”

“In December,_1955 we ordered an EDUCATORS INDEX OF
FREE MATERIALS from your company. Since that time, it
has been used extensively by our methods classes, our student
teachers, and our in-service teachers. The materials in this
Index have proved to be a valuable aid to all who have used it.”

Dr. Winifred V. Conaway,
Instructional Materials Laboratory,
Bowling Green State University,
Bowling Green, Ohio.

“It will be a pleasure to recommend the EDUCATORS INDEX

of Study In Science for the Elementary Schools.”

DR. V. O. GRAHAM, Chairman,

“The EDUCATORS INDEX is the answer to many teachers’ .
search for just such materials. It is a remarkably ﬁne contribu-
tion. Again its organization and the ﬁle form of publication is
especially usable and attractive. You are to be congratulated
on the compilation of the excellent teaching aid. We are very
happy to make it known to teachers.”

SISTER M. JOAN, O. P., Curriculum
Consultant, Commission on American
Citizenship, The Catholic University
of America

J. FREDERICK WELTZIN, University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho.
“1 have examined the EDUCATORS INDEX with great interest.
I am very much impressed by it. American industrial life is a
rich source of excellent instructional material and it appears to
me that this INDEX makes this mine of very valuable material
available in a decidedly efﬁcient and useful manner. It will un-
doubtedly be welcomed as an economical yet unusually worth
while means of curricular enrichment.”

ALTHEA I. RAGSDALE, Librarian, Henderson State Teachers
College, Arkadelphia, Ark.:

“The EDUCATORS INDEX is a valuable aid to the grade

teacher and especially the rural grade teacher where the sources

for extra teaching materials are limited. The free material is an

indispensable aid to the teacher in making and teaching units.”

' CALIFORNIA EDUCATOR CITES CURRICULUM LAG

“. . . He said many curriculums were outdated and many
textbooks did not have fresh information in them.

He cited research by a Pennsylvania State University Pro-
fessor showing that a decade elapsed between the reporting of
new geographic information and the introduction of the mate-
rial into textbooks.

‘What was found true of the lag in geography is probably
just as true in all the social sciences, in mathematics, in the
sciences and in the humanities,’ Hanna said. And it appears
that acceleration of new knowledge is widening the gap rather.
than closing it as scholars race into the future.”*

By CHRISTINE sTEVENS

Befriending Animals

Christine Stevens, Animal Welfare Institute, New York, gives a national
and international view of humane education and its relatedness to class-
room activities. Since children have a natural interest in animals, it is

not difﬁcult to teach kindness to animals.

As THE CHILD EXPERIENCES THE KINDLY
emotions which can be brought out in
such simple ways as giving food to a
hungry animal or water to a thirsty one,
he naturally develops an attitude of mind
which is a basic need of civilized human
beings. The need for this gentle and
considerate point of view is greater today
than ever before in the history Of the
world.

rllhe abuse of strength and power by
any individual becomes more serious as
the numbers of human beings increase, as
scientiﬁc power increases and as the
natural world correspondingly shrinks.
It is essential that the children growing
up in the 1960’s be truly humane. They
can learn to become so through happy
experiences in befriending animals.

Many teachers have told me how much
they value the various humane educa-
tional materials supplied to them by ani-
mal protective organizations with which
I have worked. They point out that noth-
ing else is so effective in character de-
velopment and so much enjoyed by
children while they are learning.

This approach was initiated by George
T. Angell, founder of the American
Humane Education Society. He was
deeply impressed by the fact that none of
the inmates of a Boston prison had ever
owned a dog or other pet as a child. By
the same token cruelty to animals often

426

forms a prelude to crimes against human
beings; for example, Francis H. Bloeth,
who murdered three people and who had
previously shown a liking for gruesome
methods of killing cats. Clearly, it is of
great importance that no school activity
should ever give encouragement to the
development of callous or sadistic atti-
tudes.

Kindness to Animals

Around the World

Our country is a leader in humane
education, and recognition of its impor-
tance is reflected in the fact that twenty-
nine states have legislation requiring the
teaching of humane education in their
public schools. Others have followed our
lead and advance the teaching of humane
principles in different ways. In such
faraway countries as Japan and Tan-
ganyika, contests for the best paintings
and posters illustrating kindness to ani-
mals play an important part in the pro-
gram. A Christmas card published by
the Japan Animal Welfare Society and a
poster from the Tanganyika Branch of
the Royal Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals express the spirit of
kindness and sympathy so well stated by
Dr. Albert Schweitzer: “We need a
boundless ethics that will include the
animals also.” It is in this spirit of

CHILDHOOD EDUCATION

 




Reverence for Life that the Humane Edu-
cation Institute of Africa was recently
formed. Nearer home, in Canada, the
Kindness Club is ﬂourishing. Each
branch takes an animal name—raccoon,
beaver, chipmunk—but they stand for
kindness to all animals. The Kindness
Club was founded because of the demand
of the children of New Brunswick when
they learned how greatly animals need
such help. The information was gathered
in the course of an essay contest on the
protection of animals. The guide book

The Field Rangers, an English chil-
dren’s club, is in contact with some ﬁfteen
thousand school children. With three
regular weekly classes, monthly outings,
summer camp, “Information Bureau”
library of animal books and monthly ﬁlm
showings, the group is very active. A
special feature is the Pets Corner run for
mentally retarded children in Fountain
Hospital. Club members make two eve-

Some teachers have been persuaded to
starve small animals in the classroom to
demonstrate long-established facts about
nutrition. The gruesome symptoms of
these unfortunate captives are then ob-
served by the children who, it is assumed,
will thenceforward eat a balanced diet.
That they will have been hardened to the
sufferings of those weaker than they and
will have made a serious start toward the
stultification of all compassionate feel-
ings for the defenseless is brushed aside
as unimportant. This is the antithesis of
genuine education; and when it is carried
to surgery, poisons, cancer implants and
other painful procedures on living ani-
mals, its effects on impressionable young
people are likely to go beyond callous-
ness to sadism. We cannot afford to
accept such teaching practices in a

civilized nation, and ﬁrst-rate science
teaching neither needs nor uses them.

Humane education can be correlated
with the arts as effectively as it can be
with social studies and science. Original
plays by children, in which they act the
parts or in which they use hand puppets
representing animals, can be a great suc-
cess both with the producers and the
viewers. A play about Saint Francis of
Assisi written by a superintendent of
schools offers possibilities for young
actors.

Children have a natural interest in
animals, and it is not diﬂicult to develop
feelings of sympathy and desire to help
living creatures who are smaller and
more helpless than the children them-
selves.

addresses where kids can send for free comics, posters,
maps, samples and other nice things. In addition to having
fun, they’ll learn about the world and get some painless ex-
perience in reading and writing.”

Jane Resh Thomas, Minneapolis Tribune

"The Rainbow Book is an intriguing idea. I’m really im—

pressed!”
Charles Sloan, National Geographic World Magazine

“My ten year old and his friend spent the afternoon pouring
over your book. . . They love to get mail and can use the writ-
ing experience. Thank you for a delightful resource.”

“I love your book. I use it in teaching letter writing.”

Laurel Drabkowski, Elementary Teacher

“The book explains in children’s language how to send for
things, how to address an envelope. And it is prettily divided
into color-coded chapters... We would have shown you, if a
child hadn’t come by and shouted, ‘Hey, this is my kind of
book,’ as he sped off with it.”

CATS AND KITTENS, DOGS AND PUPPIES

Even if you are just learning to read, you will enjoy these two
little booklets on dogs and cats. They are full of pictures and
the printing is large. You will learn how to be kind to pets
that don’t belong to you. You will learn how to keep your
own pets happy, too! Write to:

Animal Welfare Institute
P. O. Box 3650
Washington, DC. 20007

Ask for You and Your Dog and Kittens and Cats. Please
include $.10 for each booklet to help with postage.

 




PET INFORMATION FOR YOU

You can order a booklet that will tell you how to care for
your pet. For example, you will learn that cats like to eat
cheese and potatoes as well as cat food. And female
parakeets can be taught to talk—just like males! You will
learn what you need to know to be a good pet owner.
Write to:

American Humane Education Society

Ask for the book for your pet—Horse Care, Dog Care, Cat
Care or Care and Feeding of Cage Birds. Please enclose $.15
to cover postage for each booklet ordered.

 




THE RAINBOW BOOK

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Practically anything
a kid could want for free!

“Three Minneapolis women have collected dozens of
addresses where kids can send for free comics, posters,
maps, samples and other nice things. In addition to having
fun, they’ll learn about the world and get some painless ex-
perience in reading and writing.”

Jane Resh Thomas, Minneapolis Tribune

"The Rainbow Book is an intriguing idea. I’m really im-

pressed!”
Charles Sloan, National Geographic World Magazine

“My ten year old and his friend spent the afternoon pouring
over your book. . . They love to get mail and can use the writ-
ing experience. Thank you for a delightful resource.” ‘

Sally Cameron, Parent

“I know how to bowl from this book. I like to bowl. I like this
book. Thanks for it.”

Debby Lazar, Young Reader
“I love your book. I use it in teaching letter writing.”

Laurel Drabkowski, Elementary Teacher

“The book explains in children’s language how to send for
things, how to address an envelope. And it is prettily divided
into color-coded chapters... We would have shown you, if a
child hadn’t come by and shouted, ‘Hey, this is my kind of
book,’ as he sped off with it.”

Phyllis C. Richman, The Washington Post

A unique reference tool...a learning aid...a
fun-to-read catalog. Look around, there’s
nothing quite like THE RAINBOW BOOK.

THE RAINBOW BOOK, by Pat Blakely, Barbara Haislet and Judith Hentges
(Parkway Press, 76 pages, deluxe paperback, $3.00).

Kno Your Cat

There are many books on cat
care. Catnip: Selecting and Train—

ing Your Cat is a particularly.

good one because it lets you get to
know your cat and the ‘cat world
he comes from. Did you know that
cats were very important in Egypt
over 5000 years ago? Do you know

' why a black cat is thought to be

bad luck? Are you aware that. the
cat’s whiskers and eyebrows pro-
vide him with the most delicate
sense of touch in the whole animal
kingdom?

This delightful, informative
book, by Kurt Unkelbach, has lots
of information about cats. The care
of the cat is dealt with fully, from
grooming to breeding and training.

. There is a most interesting section

on the myths and superstitions that
have grown up around the cat.

Good Kind Lion

This delightful story begins :

Suppose an enormous lion suddenly
appeared right in front of you, what
would you do? Well, there probably
wouldn’t be much you could do, ex—

cept sit tight and hopethat he was a ‘

good kind lion. And that's pretty well
what all smaller creatures have to do
when YOU suddenly appear in front of

them—they all just hope YOU are a‘

good kind lion, too.

Your Insect Pet

Think of a pet and a dog or cat
will probably come to mind. But
since a pet is deﬁned as an animal
kept for our enjoyment, we can
also include birds, ﬁsh, and even
insects. Millions of. youngsters col-
lect a wide variety of insects,
from ﬁeld crickets and dragonﬂies
to Whirligig beetles and water
striders.

Insects are easy to obtain, re-
quire little care, and take up little
room; moreover, they are extreme-
ly interesting animals to watch
and study. Your Insect Pet intro-
duces the beginning entomologist
to one of the most fascinating
groups of animals. Carefully ex-
plaining how to ﬁnd and keep in-
sects, Richard Headstrom covers
the subject simply enough for the
beginner, yet thoroughly enough to
satisfy the serious student. David
McKay Co. $4.95.

First Aid for Insects

and Much More

An insect can be an interesting pet.
' Perhaps you know this already. You
have caught a cricket or a cater-
pillar and tried to keep it in a glass
jar or a box. Then what? Your pet
caterpillar may refuse to eat. Your
cricket may stop chirping. If that hap-
pens, your pet needs First Aid! This
First Aid book will tell you how to
keep insects well fed and lively. It
will give you hints on what to do
about problems. It will help you to
choose insects that make good pets.

You’ll learn about ants, cater—
pillars, cocoons, crickets, ﬁreﬂies,
grasshoppers, beetles, praying
mantises, and water insects. First
Aid for Insects and Much More,
by Arthur A. Mitchell with illus-
trations by Wendy Worth, tells you
where to ﬁnd insects, where to keep
them, and what to feed them. Har-
vey House. $5.35.

How to Care
for Your Bog

As many a puppy may ask:
Do you know what to do

When I catch cold and sneeze?
When‘l. bark too much

Or have too many fleas?

This practical book for young
pet owners answers these questions
and dozens more. It gives Simple
instructions about how to help your
dog live happily and healthily.

From the day you pick out your
puppy and bring him home, there
are easy rules to follow (and have
him follow) for feeding, paper
training and housebreaking, curlng
his homesickness and ﬁrst-night
blues, teaching him good manners
and tricks, taking him on .trlps,
and caring for him when he cries
or gets sick. Delightful drawmgs
by Norman Bridwell on almost
every page make it all eas1er to
understand.

So, young dog lovers of the
world, rejoice! How to Care for
Your Dog was written by Jean

Gentlemen:

The 1976-77 edition of FREE AND INEXPENSIVE LEARNING MATERIALS is in final
stages of preparation. The new book will carry many of the pamphlets, posters,
charts, and other materials listed in the current edition, plus hundreds of
new or revised titles.

Before making editorial decisions regarding the new book, we need to make a
final check with the publishers of materials concerning which items will be
available over the next two years, accuracy of annotations, prices, addresses,
and the like.

Attached to this letter is a tear sheet. On it you will find clippings from
the current (1974-75) edition covering our listing of your materials. Please
check the description, prices, ordering information, and addresses on the tear
sheet. Make changes wherever needed. If any item on the tear sheet will not
be available over the next two years, of if you prefer that we not list the
item, please write dglggg next to it. Please add to the tear sheet pertinent
information concerning any additional materials which you would like for us to
consider for possible listing. In this event, be sure to forward a copy of the
material for our examination.

As you may know, FREE AND INEXPENSIVE LEARNING MATERIALS is a basic reference
for thousands of teachers and librarians all over the United States. Its con-
tinued success can be attributed largely to two factors: the quality of
materials listed, and the promptness and courtesy with which requests are
filled. we genuinely appreciate both the privilege of listing your materials
and the service thus rendered to our users.

Sincerely,

Nancy S. Karcher,
FREE AND INEXPENSIVE LEARNING MATERIALS

Encl.: Tear Sheet

Please note: It is important that you return the tear sheet immediately in
order that we may meet our printing schedules. Responses received after

September 15 cannot be processed for the forthcoming edition.

Dear Information Resource:

The enclosed text describing your organization was pre-
pared for an early volume in our series A Directory 0f.Infbrmati0n
Resources in the United States. We would now like to have it up—
dated for possible publication in future volumes. It will also be
available for on-line computer searching and display within the
Library and the U.S. Congress, and through a network that reaches
a number of other Federal agencies. Finally, we may use the des—
cription selectively in response to inquiries we receive from
researchers looking for sources of information in your area of
competence.

Please review the text for currency. Changes may be
marked directly on the copy. If you now have access to compu-
terized data bases, or maintain any of your own, and this is not
mentioned in the text, please describe them under "Holdings."
Then sign the sheet and return it to us--even if there are no
changes, so that we will know that it has been reviewed and
approved. A return envelope requiring no postage is enclosed
for your convenience.

Your c00peration will be appreciated and I look forward
to hearing from you soon.

FIRST AID AND CARE OF SMALL ANIMALS -

An interest in and fondness for animal life is apparently a part

.of every child and it is during childhood and youth thatxthe greatest

good can be accomplished in instilling a knowledge of animals and an
interest in our inter—dependence With animals. 'During this period
much can be accomplished in guiding the student towards a sympathetic
understanding of all living things, as well as the humane and con-
siderate attitude which results from such understanding. Many
valuable object lessons can be taught during this time. This booklet
gives helpful suggestions on the first aid and care.of the small
wild animals; 46 pages, illustrated. Single copies are available
free. Additional copies are available at 50¢ each. Available in
the United States, Canada, and Australia.

Gentlemen:

I am.now working on the sixth edition of SEIECTED FREE MATERIALS FOR CLASS-
ROOM TEACHERS (Fearon Publishers, biannually since 1965) to be issued in the
summer of 1977. This edition will be designed for classroom teachers to use
through the academic year ending June, 1978.

Source listings for each edition of this book include: (1) special require-
ments to be met by requestors, (2) limitations, if any, on numbers that may be
ordered, and (3) recommendations for use by grade level and curriculum topics.
All materials described in the book will be reviewed by a panel of experienced
educators; editorial assistance will again be provided by James W. Brown, co—
author of AV INSTRUCTION: TECHNOLOGY, MEDIA, AND METHODS (Fifth edition, Mc-
Grew-Hill, 1976).

To prepare materials for this edition, I ask your cooperation as follows:

1. Review the enclosed listing for your organization as it appeared in
the 197M edition, correct it in line with your present offerings and
policies, and return it to me.

Send me one sample of all materials to be offered, both those currently
listed and still being offered, as well as those produced since the
1974 edition.

Include information on special requirements and/or limitations on order-
ing these materials so that our listings may be accurate.

As in previous editions, the only materials to be included in the book will
be those which I and the panel have had an opportunity to review personally.

The book will again include not only a listing of sources and materials classi-

fied by specific subject areas to which they relate, but also copious cross-

referencing and a complete cross-referenced index of suppliers and subject matter
areas.

Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,

Dear Children's Editor:

I am writing to you as a member of The Fund
For Animals and as a mother. I am concerned about
the reading material, both fiction and non—fiction,
that is available for children concerning animals.
I will be researching material in order to compile

a reading list for The Fund. I would appreciate it

if you would send me review c0pies of your 1975

children's books on animals,ranging from the ages
of one to ten. I would also like to see any very
exceptional books published in the past.

I hope that your house will be able to participate
in this project, and that I will be able to add many
of your books to the list.

PETER CARDOZO ' EDITOR

Animal Welfare Institute

New York, New York, 10036

Gentlemen:

It was a pleasure to include a description of your offer to
children in a previous edition of my book A WONDERFUL WORLD FOR
CHILDREN, and I am enclosing a copy of the page as it actually
appeared in the book. I am presently preparing the fifth edition
to be published by Bantam Books early in 1974 and hope you will
again wish to be represented.

The new edition of A WONDERFUL WORLD FOR CHILDREN will be, as were
the earlier editions, a treasury of gifts for children of all
ages...a guide to the thousands of exciting "things” offered by
industry, government and non—profit organizations to the children
of America. It will provide parents and teachers with new sources
for child entertainment and education, as well as means for broaden-
ing their children's interests in hobbies, sports, toys, health and
a wide variety of other activities.

If you wish to have your offer (or offers), old (or new)//included
in the new edition, kindly: 1;;

1. Send me a sample of each offer.
2. Be sure to state - exact address where people may write for
the offer
- is the offer free, or is there a mailing
and handling charge. If so, how much?
Include a letter authorizing me to include your offer in
the fifth edition of A WONDERFUL WORLD FOR CHILDREN.

I am sure you will recognize what an excellent vehicle this book is
for public relations, sampling, or getting your message into the
home. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,

ﬂié} ———

Gentlemen:

The 1974—75 edition of FREE AND INEXPENSIVE LEARNING MATERIALS is in final
stages of preparation. The new book will carry many of the pamphlets, posters,
charts, and other materials listed in the current edition, plus hundreds of
new or revised titles.

Before making editorial decisions regarding the new book, we need to make a
final check with the publishers of materials concerning which items will be
available over the next two years, accuracy of annotations, prices, addresses,
and the like.

Attached to this letter is a tear sheet. On it you will find clippings from
the current (1972-73) edition covering our listing of your materials. Please
check the description, prices, ordering information, and addresses on the tear
sheet. Make changes wherever needed. If any item on the tear sheet will not
be available over the next two years, or if you prefer that we not list the
item, please write delete next to it. Please add to the tear sheet pertinent
information concerning any additional materials which you would like for us

to consider for possible listing. In this event, be sure to forward a copy

of the material for our examination.

As you may know, FREE AND INEXPENSIVE LEARNING MATERIALS is a basic reference
for thousands of teachers and librarians all over the United States. Its con-
tinued success can be attributed largely to two factors: the quality of
materials listed, and the promptness and courtesy with which requests are
filled. We genuinely appreciate both the privilege of listing your materials
_and the service hus rendered to our users. '

Gentlemen:

I am now working on the fifth edition of SEIECTED FREE MATERIALS FOR CLASSROOM
TEACHERS (Fearon Publishers, 1965, 1967, 1969, 1971) to be issued in the spring of
197%. This edition will be designed for classroom teachers to use through the aca-
demic year ending June, 1975.

Source listings for this book will again include: (1) special requirements to
be met by requestors, (2) limitations, if any, on numbers that may be ordered, and
(3) recommendations for use by grade level and curriculum.topics. All materials de-
scribed in the book will be reviewed by a panel of experienced educators; editorial
assistance will again be provided by James W. Brown, co—author of AV INSTRUCTION:
TECHNOLOGY, MEDIA, AND METHODS (Fourth edition, McGraw-Hill, 1973).

To prepare materials for this edition, I ask your cooperation as follows:

1. Review the enclosed listing for your organization as it appeared in the
1971 edition, correct it in line with your present offerings and policies,
and return it to me.

2. Send me one sample of all materials to be offered, both those currently
listed and still being offered, as well as those produced since the
1971 edition.

3. Include information on special requirements and/or limitations on ordering
these materials so that our listings may be accurate.

As in previous editions, the only materials to be included in the book will be
those which we and the panel have had an opportunity to review personally.

The book will again include not only a listing of sources and materials classi—
fied by specific subject areas to which they relate, but also copious cross—
referencing and a complete cross—referenced index of suppliers and subject matter
areas.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Gentlemen:

As the publisher of many successful high school science
textbooks, we often need catalogs from which we can choose
laboratory equipment, audio-visual equipment and films, and
other supplementary materials to recommend in the references
within our texts and teacher guides.

In order to evaluate properly your materials for possible
inclusion in the reference sections of our books, we need to
have your current catalogs in our files. We would very

much appreciate it if you would send us copies of your

current catalogs.

Also, would you please make certain that our name is placed
on a mailing list to receive new editions of your catalogs
as soon as they are published?

Thank you.
Sincerely,

Mimic

The comments offered below are POCKET REVIEWS excerpted or paraphrased from
longer versions prepared for a forthcoming supplement to the

source book for high school teachers of psychology. Reviews represent the opinion

of the reviewer and do not constitute endorsement, implied or otherwise, by APA.

Animal Welfare Institute. Humane biology projects. New York: Author, 1960. Pp.
41. Free to teachers on request from Animal Welfare Institute, P. O. Box 3492,
Grand Central Station, New York, New York 10017.

"Although [the book] is designed to aid in the teaching of high school biology,
there are [about 15—20 projects] that are also suitable for the high school psychol—
ogy student or class.... All materials needed for the projects related to psychology
are easily obtained or constructed in a school shop.... Where animals are used in

x projects, considerable emphasis is placed on their proper care and treatment....
5 Several sections contain a bibliography of related articles and books. The reading
L\\N\leyel is sufficient for the average high school student."——Louis Snellgrove

Arkoff, A. Explorations in human behavior. New York: McGraw—Hill, 1971. Pp.
256. $3.95 paper.

"Explorations is more a manual than a textbook.... Each of 32 'explorations'
provides a pencil—and—paper exercise followed in a separate section by discussion
materials and thought questions. The topics‘are long on relevance and student inter—
est but short on presentation of basic psychological issues and principles and of
psychology as a science.... [Indeed] the mental health—adjustment emphasis is so
complete that a student would have real difficulty relating the 'explorations' to
current theory and research in general psychology.... It would require a very knowl—
edgeable teacher to integrate the materials with standard topics in social psycholo-
gy, perception, personality, learning, or development.... The vocabulary...may be
difficult for high school students.... Some knowledge of both descriptive and infer-
ential statistics is frequently assumed.... Conceptually, high school juniors or
seniors should not have much trouble with the material."——Stephen H. Davol

McConnell, J. V. (Ed.) A manual of‘psyehologieal experimentation on planarians.
(2nd ed.) Ann Arbor, Mich.: Journal of Biological Psychology, 1967. Pp. 128.
$3.50 paper.

"The 128—page manual contains eight sections on about everything needed for sim—
ple and somewhat complex experiments on planarians. A ninth section contains 50+
pages of an annotated bibliography that covers a wide variety of experimental data
on these organisms. For high school teachers and students who contemplate experi—
menting with planarians, the manual is Ehg_source of information."——Louis Snellgrove

Notterman, J. M. Laboratory manual for experiments in behavior. New York: Random
House, 1970. Pp. 96. $3.95 paper.

"Notterman‘s manual is really designed for beginning courses in experimental
psychology at the college level. It offers descriptions, instructions, and record-
ing materials for 10 experiments that range from psychophysical methods through
classical and operant conditioning to conflict and personality testing. Unfortu—
nately, a well—equipped behavior laboratory is a necessary prerequisite for nearly
all of the studies.... If, however, ...[adequate] facilities are available, Notter-
man's manual would provide an excellent range of experiences in experimental measure-
ment and manipulation of behavioral variables."——Henry S. Pennypacker

CK:

Gﬁmmickry Editor's note: The following gimmicks were submitted by Paul J.
Woods, professor of psychology at Hollins College, Roanoke, Virginia. What may ap-
pear to be a male bias in the first gimmick has its reasons; Hollins is a women's
college. The gimmick can, of course, be done with photographs of females. An inter—
esting twist might be to use both male and female photographs in a coed class and
compare each sex's mean ranking of its own gender with the other sex's ranking of
same.—-J. R. N.

"The argument can be made quite strongly that if a subject matter is to be
called a science, then measurement must be one of its basic tools. Many students, of
course, are familiar with common forms of measurement, but they have probably not run
into psychological scaling techniques such as rating scales and other devices. And
they certainly 'know' that such things as aesthetic qualities, for example, can never
be measured. Along these lines I have capitalized on my student population's predic-
table and powerful interest in the opposite sex by having them rank-order a dozen
male photographs according to good looks or sex appeal.

"The students find that they can do this quite readily and are often surprised
to discover that psychologists consider this ranking to be a form of measurement.
But we can go several steps beyond by taking the individual rank orders of each stu-
dent and obtaining a mean rank for each picture. The operation results in placing
the pictures on an interval scale. For example, the sexiest male may have a mean
rank of 1.5, the next sexiest 2.0, and the third 3.4. When you show these results to
the class the following period, they will usually agree that the first two men are
-closer to each other than are the second and the third. That observation affords a
takeoff point for further discussion on the possibilities of measuring many things
that they had never before considered to be possible.

"Now, while the human organism can be used for obtaining measures of such com—
plex things as sex appeal, aesthetic qualities, and what—have-you, I also like to
point-out that the human individual is often a very unreliable reporter of events. A
simple way of disrupting the students' self-confidence in their ability to observe is
to have the entire class open their textbooks to a particular page and perform the
simple task of counting the number of words on that page. Give a few rules from hav-
ing studied the page beforehand; for example, tell them that a hyphenated word counts
as one, that an abbreviation counts as one, and that the letter 'a' counts as a word.

"Turn them loose and let them count the words. Have them write the number on a
piece of paper and pass it to the front. Then make a frequency distribution of their
responses. Let me assure you, indeed almost guarantee, that you will obtain amazing
findings with this simple demonstration. Even when-I have thrown out extreme scores,
excusing the student as perhaps having a hangover or deliberately trying to foul up
the data collection, I have still had a range of 100 from the lowest to the highest
word count! The evidence is rather shattering to the students. You just have to as-
sure them that everybody makes these sorts of mistakes, thereby demonstrating that

the human organism is, indeed, a very fallible and unreliable measuring instrument
unless extreme precaution is taken."

The Oregon Psychological Association is experimenting this year with a Traveling
Operant Lab for high schools. The Lab, which includes an itinerant pigeon, a cage,
an Operant chamber, and a control panel, is available for 2 weeks to schools that re—
quest it. With it come written instructions, suggestions for experiments, and a lab
manual. Delivery is made by a psychologist who briefs the teacher in the use of the
Lab. Requests for information and/or use may be directed to Dr. William Wiest, De—
partment of Psychology, Reed College, Portland, Oregon 97202 or Dr. Don Batten, De—
partment of Psychology, Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon 97219. (Editor's
note: Presumably, use is restricted to Oregon high schools, but other state psycho—
logical associations may wish information on initiating similar programs.)

The American Sociological Association' sgproject on Sociological Resources for
the Social Studies has done psychology teachers a good turn in the form of two epi—
sodes from its Episodes in Social Inquiry series. One episode, entitled Testing for
Truth: A Study Of'Hypothesis Evaluation, might be used to teach psychology students
how to form hypotheses, write questionnaires, do simple sampling, and do chinsquare
analyses of data. The episode could thus form the background for a class experiment
on attitude surveying. Another episode, Images Of'PeOple, presents some classical
experiments in social perception. Reversible figure~ground relationships as well as
studies of prejudice by Allport, Postman, and Razran, make the episode particularly
applicable to the teaching of high SchOOl psychology. Other episodes in the series
are probably more useful in teaching sociology or the social sciences; however, the
set does illustrate how psychology and sociology can be combined. Episodes may be
purchased separately in one—title lots of 10. Each lot is accompanied by a free In—
structor's Guide. Write Allyn & Bacon, 470 Atlantic Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts
01867 for price quotations on the series.

 

 

 

Now is the best time for all psychology teachers to affiliate with the Amer—
ican Psychological Association. The High School Teacher Affiliate fee is $7.50,
$5 of which may be credited toward a subscription to an APA journal. You can, of
course, affiliate any time, but action now means receiving journal issues when
they are timely since subscriptions are offered on a January—December basis. In-
cluded in the fee is a subscription to the APA Monitor, a monthly newspaper car—
rying items of interest to psychologists. To affiliate, just complete the form
enclosed in this month's mailing of Periodically and send it along with a check
for $7.50 to the address indicated.

APA's Division on the Teaching of Psychology (Division 2) also offers affil-
iate membership to high school psychology teachers. A fee of $1 brings the Divi—
sion 2 newsletter to your door three times a year. The newsletter publishes dis—
cussions of teaching and features a regular column on precollege psychology. A
form for DivisiOn 2 affiliation is also enclosed with this mailing. ——M. J.

 

 

 

 




The 1971 U. S. Registry of Junior and Senior High School Teaching Personnel in
Science, Mathematics, and the Social Sciences has names and addresses for 5,822 high
school psychology teachers. The figure, based on a 75% response to a fall 1970 sur—
vey, represents a net gain of 177 over the previous year's total. Comparable fig—
ures for sociology are 9,565, for anthropology, 1,994. Mailing labels for the high
school psychology teachers may be purchased from the Registry at a cost of $20-26
per thousand for nonprofit institutions, $30—36 per thousand for commercial institu—
tions. Random samples and state or zip code selections are offered at an additional
cost. For information, contact John F. Crosson or Sue Holtzclaw, National Science
Teachers Association, 1201 Sixteenth Street, N. W., Washington, D. C. 20036.

 

Writing in the November 1971 issue of the American Biology Teacher (33, 472;
479), James M. Polt suggests some "Experiments in Animal Behavior" that are equally
of interest to the American psychology teacher. The demonstrations include orienta—
tion and learning in mealworms, sensory processes and social behavior in crickets,
and learning, innate preferences, and imprinting in chicks. A minimum of equipment
is required for the experiments and for care of the animals. Offprints of the arti-
cle are available from Polt, Department of Psychology, Temple Buell College, 1800
Pontiac Street, Denver, Colorado 80220. The entire issue may be purchased for $1
from the National Association of Biology Teachers, 1420 N Street, N. W., Washington,
D. C. 20005.

 

 

 

‘ Media Mix iS'a $5—a—year monthly newsletter coveringgall manner of media but
particularly heavy on the—film scene. Although its scope is far broader than psy—
chology, it regularly carries a couple of items of potential interest to psychology
teachers. For example, the 11/15/71 issue (Volume 3, Number 2) reports on‘a new,
170—page paperback, Sex Education on Film (Laura Singer and Judith Buskin; Teacher's
College Press, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027; $3.95) that critiques
120 pertinent audiovisuals. That same issue prints a Film Availability Chart giving
comparative rental prices on 60 short films, some relevant to psychology. In the
10/15/71 issue (Volume 3, Number 1), the editor reviews "Obedience," a documentary
film on psychologist Stanley Milgram‘s experiments with punishment by shock (16 mm/
45 min./b&w; rental $25, purchase $260; New York University Film Library, 26 Wash—
ington Place, New York, New York 10002). Persons interested in.Media.Mix may in—
quire of Jeffrey Schrank, Editor, Box 5139, Chicago, Illinois 60680.

 

 

"Psychological Thrillers" as used by Ivan N. McCollom is not an allusion to
Hitchcdck‘s genre. It isfan article subtitled "Psychology Books Students Read When
Given Freedom of Choice" appearing in the October 1971 issue of the American Psychol—
ogist (26, 921-927). The author lists and comments on 15 books that have stood the
test of student evaluation many times over. The hardy publications include perennials
like Axline's Dibs: In Search of Self'alongside such new breeds as Green‘s I Never
Promised You A Rose Garden and Grier and Cobbs' Black Rage. Reprints of the article
are available from McCollom, 1696 View Way, El Cajon, California 92020.

FREE MATERIALS
‘ FOR SCHOOLS
AND LIBRARIES

Their Signiﬁcance and Source

( ‘ E ARE living in one of the ﬂood

tides of world history. One of
the problems raised by this situation is
that of. keeping up with the surging
trend of events.

“As supplements to standard texts,
teachers are more and more turning to
the many excellent pamphlets now
available. The advantages of such ma-
terial are numerous. The pamphlets are
more up-toidate than the formal text-
books. They are usually written in a
popular style and attractively printed.
They add interest and variety to the
usual classroom reference books.”-—The

FREE MATERIALS FOR SCHOOLS

Their Signiﬁcance in
Curriculum Improvement

School curriculum enrichment is of unprecedented impor-
tance and signiﬁcance. The immediate future will mark the
initiation and execution of vital and far reaching plans by gov-
ernment and industry. One of the major needs in the im-
provement and enrichment of School curriculum is that of
bringing boys and girls in close touch with the events that are
actually happening in the world around them.

There are many ways in which educators can meet the
demands of curriculum improvement. Some of the most valu-
able means of achieving this end are the radio, TV, the ﬁlm,
newspapers, magazines, and the thousands of publications and
exhibits that are made available to schools without cost by
federal and state agencies, private foundations, and industrial
and commercial concerns. The materials available through
the EDUCATORS INDEX OF FREE MATERIALS include
maps, bulletins, pamphlets, exhibits, charts, books, magazines,
and other items that can be had for the asking and may
become the property of the school or may be borrowed for
appropriate periods of use.

Why Are Free Materials Worthy of
Use in Schools?

Sometimes the question is raised as to why materials
that are available without cost are worthy of use in schools. '
An excellent answer to this question is given by Dr. Thomas
H. Briggs, as follows:

f‘No intelligent person can go over a mass of materials
furnished by commercial concerns without wishing that he had
theotime to satisfy aroused interest and to extend his own edu-
cation by readmg carefully many of the books and pamphlets.
They tell the story of the origin processing, distribution, and
uses of steel, nickel, copper, aluminum, asbestos, marble, gran-
ite, hmestone, asphalt, concrete, and oil; of cotton, wool, ﬂax,
811k, and new textile ﬁbers; of rubber, cork, the woods, and
other useful. materials; of practically all kinds of clothing, and
of its selection, manufacture, care and cleaning; of nearly all
human foods —- salt, sugar, spices, wheat, com, the small
cereals, coffee and tea, cocoa and chocolate, milk, cheese, citrus
fruits, apples, pears, peaches, and prunes — and of their selec-
tion, preparation, preservation, and serving; of all of the com-

mon food animals —— cattle, sheep, swine, chickens, ﬁsh, and
oysters — classiﬁed as to their kinds and nutritive values with
instructions for their buying breeding care, marketing, and
preparation for the table; of the furnishing and care of the
home, and of the machines and materials use-d in it — refrigera-
tors, vacuum cleaners, air conditioning units, heating and
lighting equipment, means of preventing and extinguishing
ﬁres, of carpets and rugs, glass and china ware, stoves and
ranges, cooking utensils, and gadgets for the kitchen; of how
to keep well, avoid accidents and prolong life; of machinery
of almost every imaginable kind —— pumps, turbines, steam and
internal combustion and Diesel engines, carburetors, batteries,
dry cells, transformers, thermostats, thermometers, barom-
eters, microscopes, telescopes, cameras; of reapers and com-
bines; of communication — telephones, radio, printing, paper,
pens, pencils, and typewriters; of budgeting, banking, saving
money, making investments, and selecting insurance. In short,
business (governmental agencies and private foundations) has
prepared and is offering to schools free of cost or at nominal
charges material on almost all conceivable phases of life with
which current education is attempting to acquaint youth.” “

What the INDEX is and How it Works

The INDEX is an annotated schedule of free materials
which have signiﬁcant educational value. The sources of
the Materials include departments of the federal govern-
ment, state agencies, chambers of commerce, travel bureaus,
private foundations, and many of our major industrial con-
cerns. ‘

As can be seen from the Table of Contents, the organiza-
tion of the INDEX follows largely the subject-matter break-
down found in most state and city courses of study. Yet it is
sufficiently ﬂexible to permit continuous synchronization
with a constantly shifting curriculum and curricular em—
p a51s.

Because of the heavy assignments in other directions, it
is impossible for the individual school administrators super-
visors, and classroom teachers to become familiar with free
materials that are available. Consequently, the EDUCATORS
INDEX OF FREE MATERIALS has been organized in order
that educators may be familiar with what is available from
contemporary governmental, industrial, and business insti-
tutions. The INDEX gives educators a convenient and easy
means of getting such materials for the inquiry and discovery
method of instruction in their classrooms.

Editorship and Selection of Materials

The INDEX is edited by a recognized educator, Dr. John
Guy Fowlkes, Charles Anderson, Professor of Educational
Administration Emeritus, University of Wisconsin, and Paul
T. Cody, M. A. The editors examine nearly twice as many
materials as they list in the INDEX. The items listed in the
INDEX represent a selection of from ﬁfty to sixty percent of
the materials which the editors examine. In each revision, all
new titles are starred. No items are listed without speciﬁc
permission from the agency, institution, or concern which fur-
nishes the materials, and the availability of the materials
is veriﬁed annually.

The History of the INDEX

The ﬁrst edition of the INDEX appeared in March 1937.
At its birth the INDEX was a modest, 80-page volume. There
were ﬁve revisions, making a total of six editions, in 1937.
Since its humble beginning and limited use in 1937, some
100,000 people scattered throughout the United States, and
indeed, the world, have used the INDEX. Some Subscribers to
the INDEX have now been using it for thirty years.

Learning Re’Deﬁned

Dr. Roy M. Hall suggests that we should re-deﬁne learn-
ing in order to make it possible for media to contrlbute more
effectively to education: '

“Learning is not just a matter of transmitting informa
tion from one agent, the teacher, to another agent, the learn-
er. As long as learning is conceived in such limited terms the
new media will be used for just as limited purposes . . .
Learning is a matter of cognition, perception, discovery,
realization of self, understanding fundamental issues, distln-
guishing between classes of things, seeing patterns and re a-
tionships, and cause and effect. How much difference won
it make in our planning the use of new media if we deﬁne
learning in these terms rather than simply as accumulatlon
of knowledge and facts? . . .”*

Areas in Which the INDEX is
Particularly H el pful

The EDUCATORS INDEX OF FREE MATERIALS will
prove of great help to superintendents, principals, supervisors,
librarians, and teachers. Superintendents, principals, and
supervisors will ﬁnd it valuable in formulating policies and in
organizing teacher-training programs. The materials that can
be obtained through the EDUCATORS INDEX OF FREE
MATERIALS will be of inestimable help especially in:

1. Improving the Curriculum by

a. keeping the school curriculum up-to—date,

b. . making the school more realistic by keeping the cur-
riculum in constant contact with developments of
social and industrial importance,

0. establishing and maintaining curriculum laboratory-
libraries;

2. Improving Teachers’ Work in
a. preparing teaching units,
b. organizing an activity program,
c. developing a good bulletin board program,
d. providing for individual differences; and

3. Improvin Pupils’ Work by
a. stimu ating pupil interest and inquiry,
b. giving pupils the opportunity, and means of doing
things for themselves. . .

Improving the Curriculum

Excellent as textbooks of today are, it is impossible for
the regular textbook to stay up-to-date and reach the class-
room is quickly as is needed. World Peace, economic stability,
foreign aid, world trade, industrial peace, nuclear energy,
aerospace travel and exploration, control of the environment
and ther breathtaking social and scientiﬁc phenomena are
appearing too fast to be included in textbooks that are more
than a few months in print. Consequently, by supplementing
the regular text, the materials in the INDEX prove invaluable.

The indictment is sometimes made that schools are too
far removed from affairs of actual everyday life. This accusa-
tlon is not nearly so well founded as was formerly the case,

-5...

 




 

 

 

cl

but schools could and should keep the curriculum closely in
touch with contemporary life. As was implied in the discus-
sion above, the use of materials obtainable through the
INDEX will do much to refute this indictment of the school
curriculum and contribute signiﬁcantly to the performance of
the pupils and the accountability of the instructional program.

Improving the Teachers’ Work

The materials available through the INDEX will be
invaluable to teachers in preparing teaching units; organizing
activity programs; selecting, organizing and directing good
bulletin board exhibits; and providing for individual differ-
ences among pupils.

The development of effective teaching units for the Inquiry
system of learning and the organization of sound activity pro-
grams depends to a high degree upon the diversity and the
amount of supplementary text materials that are used. In-
dividual pupil and pupil-committee assignments around such
things as scrapbooks, exhibits and talks can be greatly im-
proved by the use of materials available through the INDEX.

As the concept of student investigation becomes more and
more accepted by the science teaching profession, science
teachers begin to see that investigations are teaching much
more than science content. They are teaching the students the
art of decision making. Learners begin to get an understand-
mg of the place of evidence in a logical structure of how
evidence is secured, evaluated and used. Since only a small
percentage of the students in our classes will pursue science
as a career, what they learn about how to investigate repre-
sents the major gain they will carry away from the study of
sc1ence.”* While Dr. Renner’s comments refer to Science,
they seem to have equal validity for other areas of the
curriculum.

. Ifroviding for individual differences and more personal-
ized.1nstruction has been one of the essentials of a good
curriculum and good teaching practice during recent years. In
a very real sense, one of the strongest justiﬁcations for the
organization of activity programs and committee and individ-
ual pupil assignments is that such practices are effective means
of prov1d1ng for pupil differences. Consequently, here again
the INDEX proves valuable in meeting one of the most serious
and perplexing problems in the life of the classroom teacher.

Miss Doris Phipps outlines some uses of free materials to
improve teachers’ work in the following way:
To motivate units of work.
To make the room and learning situation more attractive.
To provide more resource material for capable students.
To lprovide learning materials not available elsewhere.
To end variety and prevent or break monotony.
To provide more speciﬁc and concise information.
To relieve a textbook or map shortage.
To provide sources for exhibits.
. To help stimulate parent interest.
10. To provide source for teaching aids and guidebooks.
11. To help develop good health habits.
12. To help correlate and integrate subject areas.*

dent, Wisconsin Association of County Supervising Teachers.

Improving the Students’ Work

Students who use materials listed in the INDEX are
more interested in their work. The INDEX gives them the
opportunity and the means to do things for themselves. It
provides many materials students want and need for individ-
ual and committee projects such as scrapbooks, programs, and
bulletins.

“Related to the use of textbooks are the other types of
learning materials which are indispensable for the gifted.
These include supplementary books, pamphlets, periodicals,
newspapers, realia, recordings, and construction materials.
Obviously, such things are of value to pupils with average or
below abilities as well; for the gifted, however, they are
within the range of minimum essentials for effective learn-
mg.”

“The INDEX should have a place in ever school in the
United States. The service should be avai able to every
department and every classroom.” 2

Some Classroom Case Examples of Free
Material Use

Miss Virginia Goldsmith gives some excellent suggestions
on the use of free materials in the classroom. A few case ex-
amples follow:

 

__.7__

 




0‘

Case 1: Use of Free Materials in‘the Study of Transportation.

“A primary group was studying transportation. Not one
of the children had ever been on a train or an airplane. As
this unit was being studied during the war, no excursion could
be made. This group, however, had a very alert teacher who
found that railroad and airplane agencies have a variety of
excellent material which they. furnish to schools. Through
the use of pictures, maps, booklets, stories, and ﬁlmstrips,
every child in this primary grade vicariously experienced an
airplane ride and a trip by train. The art, music, and language
work which grew out of this project more than compensated
the teacher for her efforts in collecting materials for this
transportation unit.”

Case 2: Use of Free Materials in the Study of Farm Craps and
Geography.

“Many pupils in the northern states have never seen cot-
ton ,or sugar cane. A department of agriculture in one of the
southern states sends out a small exhibit of sugar cane, cotton
and rice. This exhibit stimulated the pupils in one seventh
grade to broaden their study of the South, and the result was
a culminating activity in the form of an assembly program
which was so excellent in quality that all the pupils in the
school beneﬁted. It is also logical to assume that no seventh
grader who participated in this activity will ever forget the
signiﬁcant facts relating to this section of the United States.”

Case 3: Use of Free Materials in the Study of Conservation.

. “A ninth-grade group studying conservation was able to
ﬁnd so much excellent free and inexpensive material relating
to their study that their enthusiasm and interest became so
intense that they were instrumental in inﬂuencing the city
council to conserve the natural resources of the city.”

Numerous other. examples could be given. However, the
quality of the learning that takes lace through the use of
these free and inexpensive materia will be determined by

the teacher who selects and evaluates the aid and then plans ‘

for its efficient use.”
