SIR ROBERT GOWER, K.C.V.O., O.B.E., D.C.L., J.P., M.P.

 

Some brief particulars of the Society.

A. The Society was founded in I824.

B. Its methods of procedure are Educational, Persuasive and
Punitive.

0. Since the year 1837 it has registered close on 316,000 con-
victions, but this total should be multiplied tenfold if the
cautions given by the Society are reckoned. Over 200
Inspectors are constantly employed in England and Wales alone,
in which the Society has over 1,800 Branches and Auxiliaries.

D. The Society holds Annual Essay Competitions on the duty of
kindness to animals in the schools of the Metropolis and in the
country; it has a Junior Division for children and young pe0p1e,
and is constantly increasing this work by means of gratis
Lectures and Public Addresses ; it invites the Clergy to preach
Sermons on kindness to animals on the 4th Sunday after
Trinity; it publishes The Animal World and Animal Ways
mcnthly, besides issuing a great many pamphlets and leaﬂets
inculcating the duty of kindness to animals. It is

Supported Only by Voluntary Contributions

and the Council need every assistance to enable them to
continue their necessary and constantly increasing work.

HOW TO TREAT DOMESTIC ANIMALS.

 

THE CAT
‘Aé‘

MANY thousands of cats in this country are very

 

badly treated. It is so easy to obtain and keep a

cat, often merely as a toy or a playmate for children,
or as a temporary convenience for ridding a house of mice,
and so easy, alas, to get rid of the cat when it has served
its turn of usefulness ! Few people realise the extent of
the misery of the homeless cats of large towns; few
remember these wretched creatures, which, turned adrift
in the streets, brutally treated on every side, drag out a
miserable existence of slow starvation.

Every cat requires suitable food at regular times, a
comfortable home, and proper care and attention. Any-
one who is not prepared to attend to these matters, or
anyone to whom they are “ too much trouble,” should
not keep a cat.

ACCOMMODATION.——A cat likes a warm, clean bed. A
large lidless wooden box, turned on its side, with a narrow
board fastened across the front, makes a good bed, or a
stout basket, raised from the ground to avoid draughts,
as cats are very susceptible to these. The bed can be ﬁlled
3% with soft white paper or a piece of blanket ; cats like soft,
f

 

yielding beds. The bedding must be changed frequently.

Newspapers should not be used unless covered over by

soft white paper, as the printing ink is poisonous and the
! ' cat may be injured by it when licking its coat.

up to about ﬁve months, with plenty of milk, milk pudding,
boiled ﬁsh, cut up ﬁne, or puppy biscuits soaked in milk

1
l FEEDING.——Kittens should have at least four meals a day,
l
E or broth. Lumpy food should never be given to them. ,

 

 




HOW TO TREAT THE
DOMESTIC ANIMALS CAT

 

Adult cats need food twice a day, in the morning and
evening. The quantity should be about I oz. to every
I 1b. of their weight. The food may be cooked meat
(cut up), or ﬁsh, mixed with green vegetables sometimes ;
a little ﬁnely minced raw meat, or liver occasionally.
Cats should be given something they can chew, .to keep
their teeth in good condition. Chicken, rabbit and ﬁsh
bones should never be given, as they may cause great
suffering and death by piercing the intestines. Olive oil
should be given occasionally; the best way, if the cat

' like it, is to give it with sardines. Grass should
always be accessible; if necessary, this can be grown in
boxes. Adult cats should always have their milk diluted
with water, and fresh water should always be handy,
especially in summer. In winter, food should be warm.
Never give stale food or use dirty dishes; clean white
paper laid on the ﬂoor is better than a dirty dish.

CARE OF CATS.—A cat’s coat should be regularly brushed
and combed, especially during moulting time, to prevent
the formation of hair—balls, the source of much illness.
Should ﬂeas be troublesome, buy a reliable cat ﬂea-powder ;
rub this well into the coat, let it stay for a while, then
brush it all out and go over the coat with a ﬁne comb.

HOUSE MANNERs.—Kittens can be trained to house
manners by being provided with a box or tray ﬁlled with
sand, ﬁne earth or, better still, soft peat litter. All cats
should have a tray in some convenient corner. It should
be regularly cleaned, or the cat will not use it, but carbolic
should never be used, as it is poisonous to cats.

 

AILMENTs.-—-Illness should be suspected if a cat sneezes
much, has watery eyes, or a cough, refuses to eat and
vomits frequently. When these symptoms are noticed,
a cat should be taken to a veterinary surgeon or advice
sought at once from the nearest R.S.P.C.A. Clinic, whose
address can be obtained from any policeman. Canker is

one of the worst troubles; the symptoms are constant
scratching, head shaking and the carrying of one ear lower
than the other. It should be treated only by a qualiﬁed
veterinary surgeon, but it can be prevented by regularly
cleaning the ears. Soak a soft piece of linen or lint in
olive oil, twist this into a spiral and gently insert it and

turn it in the ear. Care must be taken not to press too
hard.

ADMINISTERING MEDICINE—Success in dosing a cat
depends in a large measure upon the skill and experience
of the operator, and to some lesser extent upon the
patience or docility of the animal. ‘

With a quiet cat one may endeavour to administer liquids
by taking the head lightly in the left hand, tilting
it a little backwards,
then with the ﬁrst
ﬁnger and thumb of
the right hand en-
deavouring to obtain
a hold of the fleshy
angle of the mouth in
such a way that an
assistant can then pour
in small quantities of
the potion from a
teaspoon or measure—
glass or fountain-pen

ﬁller.

 

Pills, capsules or
powders are very much
more easily admin-
istered to cats than are
liquids. Admin/flaring a pill to a cat.

 




HOW TO TREAT

. DOMESTIC ANIMALS

 

 

 

To give a pill or capsule, open the mouth and drop the
pill or capsule on the back of the tongue, and close the
mouth.

Tasteless powders may be dusted on the back of the tongue
in the usual way, or mixed with the food.

Nauseous or extremely bitter substances must be given in
pill form or enclosed in a gelatine capsule.

Drugs possessing a disagreeable flavour will easily so
nauseate a cat that the animal may absolutely refuse to
feed for many days.

Kittens can be trained to take medicine by being given
sweetened milk or something they like in a spoon ; when
the time comes for giving them oil, they will not struggle
so much against the spoon. Tasteless liquid paraffin is
better than caster—oil. '

BREEDING.—A cat that is about to have kittens should
be provided with a comfortable bed in a sheltered place,
out of all draughts, where it can be quiet and undisturbed.
The bedding should be soft; a small blanket will do,
but it must be changed frequently. Never use newspapers,
or straw, or hay.

Before the kittens arrive the cat needs more food, given
three times a day, and undiluted milk, slightly warmed;
no lumpy food must be given.

When the kittens are born, those not wanted should be
painlessly destroyed. An R.S.P.C.A. Inspector will always
assist in this task. Some cats do not miss their kittens,
and they can all be taken away soon after birth, but it is
usually advisable to leave one kitten with the mother
for a time; if this is not done, the cat may suEer from

milk trouble. It is not kind to destroy every litter of
kittens ; a cat should be allowed to bring up one kitten
about once a year. Naturally, a cat with only one kitten
does not require a great deal of milky food. If all the
kittens of a litter are destroyed, or if all die at birth, the

diet must not be very stimulating, the bowels must be .

kept open. If the milk glands become inﬂamed, they
should be bathed frequently with hot water and a little
olive oil applied with gentle massage.

If all the kittens are taken away from the mother, prepare
a fresh bed for her in another room, and burn all the old
bed, so that nothing can remind her of her missing family.
Extra fuss and petting will help her to forget her kittens.

GENERAL HINTs.--Never put a leather collar on a cat or
tie a ribbon round its neck ; a cat may get caught up by
a collar or a ribbon and be strangled. If a collar must
be worn, it should be made of elastic.

Remember that cats are very sensitive, nervous creatures,
and can very easily be hurt. Do not let children pull
them about or squeeze them. When lifting a cat always
support the hind quarters with one hand. Do not lift
cats up by the skin of their necks after their mother has
ceased doing this.

Cats should never be turned out at night. They run the
risk of catching diseases from strays, and of suffering from
cold, damp, etc. The night is the time when they are
specially useful to you in the house, as the mice are about
then. If a cat is fed late in the evening and has his tray
in a convenient corner, he need never go out after dark.
