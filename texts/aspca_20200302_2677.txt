'HORSES RESCUED FROM A FIRE

When the RSPCA Inspector read of a ﬁre at the
Kent Street stables, Northam, and saw in the
newspaper mention of the gallantry of Mr P. J.
Goodman, a horsekeeper, he called upon him and
found that as a result of his efforts on behalf of
two horses in the ﬁre he was badly bruised about
the legs and had difﬁculty in walking. When Mr
Goodman arrived at the stable he found it a
blazing inferno, but ran in without thinking of his
own safety. After he had been in the stable some
time one horse and then another ran out. Almost
immediately after Mr Goodman reventered the
stable he was ﬂung out again, and it is now known
that he was literarally kicked out by a horse mada
dened by the ﬁre. Despite his injury he wanted to
go in again and onlookers had to restrain him by
force. Mr Goodman has received the RSPCA
Silver lVledal and Certiﬁcate for his gallantry.

Another Silver Medal winner is Suvafﬁcer
T. Jones, who rescued a lamb from Manod Bach
Mountain, Blaenau Ffestiniog. The lamb had been
on the mountain for several days and no one
would attempt a rescue because of the slippery
state of the ground. The local RSPCA Inspector
organized a party consisting of seven men who
went to the spot. Suvafﬁcer Jones was roped
and lowered from a vantage point carrying a sack
with him. To get the lamb the Sub~Ofﬁcer had to
take both hands from the rope on which he was
lowered. Below him was a sheer drop of 250 feet.
Despite every difﬁculty he managed to bring the
lamb to safety.

Another two Silver Medal winners in the most
recent RSPCA list are Jennifer Pearce, aged 11,
who, as was previously reported in Animal
World, displayed gallantry in rescuing a pony
during ﬂoods at Lynmouth, and Mr W. Burgess,

who rescued animals from a ﬁre at Station Road, '

Waddington, near Lincoln.

Bronze Medals

For the rescue of dogs the following have received
RSPCA Bronze Medals:

Inspector E. Paul, Mr G. Morris and Mr F.
Noble.

Fireman Kilshaw, who rescued a cat from a tree
in the grounds of Corpus Christi Church, BOSa
combe, and Mr W. Sutton, who rescued a cat
from a tree at Little Hardﬁeld Hall, Essex, have
both received Bronze Medals.

Station—Ofﬁcer W. J. Matthews rescued a lamb
who had fallen over the cliffs at Labrador Bay,
Shaldon, Teignmouth, and Sub’Ofﬁcer A. Murray
rescued a sheep who had fallen over ‘a cliff at
South Hook, Milford Haven. Both these men re
ceive RSPCA Bronze Medals and the same award
goes to Mr N. Smith for rescuing a jackdaw

 

trapped in a water—cooling tower at Albion Road,
Tunbridge Wells.

,With each of the medals listed goes the
RSPCA framed citation certiﬁcate.

OBITUARY

With sincere regret we report the following
deaths: Mrs C. M. Laing, hon sec Haltwhistle
Auxiliary; Mrs C. Bonham Southey, hon sec
Frinton Aux; Mr John Fearick, a supporter;
Mr J. Crowther Cox, president, Rotherham
Branch.

UNWANTED

Frequent reports published in Animal World show
that the RSPCA has successfully prosecuted for
the killing of pets by improper methods. The
drowning of kittens and puppies can lead to
convictions for cruelty.

An illustrated poster is supplied by the
RSPCA on this subject. It reads:

ALLOW NO UNWANTED PUPPY
OR KITTEN TO GROW UP . . .

Provide a humane home or
a humane end and so
prevent unnecessary suffering.

BIRDS OF CHARACTER

Have you ever thought of birds as different char—
acters just like people? Quite a lot of them closely
resemble various occupations of human beings.

There are the acrobats—the little cheery blue
tits. Everyone knows their skilful antics as they
feed on bird’rails in gardens, often hanging up;
side down in their efforts to peck at strings of
nuts. They seem quite happy eating a meal in this
strange position. Starlings are mimics or imper»
sonators, for, just as people imitate one another, so
does the familiar starling copy the voices of other
birds he hears. I have often been deceived by the
efforts of an old starling, and have looked round
for some interesting bird heard nearby, perhaps a
jay or a lapwing or crow, only to ﬁnd the sound
was made by the starling sitting so unconcerned
on my chimney’pot.

One bird, the redabacked shrike, is a butcher.
He feeds on small birds, frogs, mice and beetles,
catching them and then impaling their bodies on a
thorny bush till they are required to feed himself
or a nestful of hungry babies. This larder as it is
called represents a butcher’s shop with its
different carcasses.

The magpie is a clever architect, for if you have
ever seen its nest you will know how clever he
really is. It is like a fortress, a great domeashaped
structure made of roots, thorny sticks, clay and
mud, with a tiny hole in one side. The magpie is
cunning, too, for although he often feeds on the
eggs and young of small birds, he makes sure that

his own family shall be quite safe. There are many
bird ﬁshermen; the heron with its long stiltvlike
legs and long beak that ﬁshes in streams and the
cormorant that dives in the sea for ﬁsh, are two
of the cleverest. In Japan tame cormorants are
kept to ﬁsh for their owners. They are taken out
in boats and then allowed to dive for ﬁsh. A small
metal collar round the neck of each bird prevents
it from swallowing its prey, which is taken by the
natives and used for food.

There are several huntsmen in the bird world,
ranging from the majestic eagle and buzzard to the
more common sparrow~hawk or brown owl. They
all pursue various smaller creatures like rats,
mice, voles, rabbits, small birds and hares and
feed upon their victims. The sparrOthawk is

the boldest and dashes over hedges and ﬁelds

to swoop down swiftly on some unsuspecting

creature, or if necessary to chase it till it is caught.

Of course there are good and bad characters.
The skuas, big birds rather like gulls, are robbers
and chase smaller sea—birds that have caught ﬁsh

TWO FINED FOR OPERATION
ON A DOG

A dirty penknife and razor blades were used in an
operation on a terrier dog in a ﬁlthy cellar and no
anaesthetic was given, it was said at Southampton
Magistrates’ Court, when the RSPCA prosecuted
two men for unlawfully subjecting the dog to an
operation whilst the animal was not during the
whole of the operation under the inﬂuence of a
general anaesthetic.

Both men were ﬁned £5 and on a second charge
preferred by the Royal College of Veterinary
Surgeons, the men were each ﬁned £2 for prac’
tising veterinary surgery when not registered to
do so. They each had to pay three guineas costs.

Inspector Hallam said he asked one of the de—
fendants about the operation and the man rev
plied, ‘Why not? I have every right. I have done
hundreds of pigs and sheep in Ireland. I have got

a certiﬁcate to do it.’ (A5775)
' OLD SOLDIERS NEVER DIE

 

[Photo by courtesy of the Newark Advertiser

This old grey charger, named ‘Badger’, has reached the

age of 28. He belongs to Colonel G. H. Vere-Laurie, of

Carlton Hall, Carlton-on-Trent, Notts. Col Vere-Laurie

bought ‘Badger’ in I935, when he was on manoeuvres
with the 9th Lancers at Badminton, Glos.

DOGS LIFTED BY LEADS

An RSPCA supporter mentions that she has been
distressed to see dogs lifted by the lead..This
thoughtless practice can cause pain and might lead
to serious injury. Any friend of animals would
quickly speak up for a dog treated in this way.

HEAT KILLED CHICKS

Counsel prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA at
Southend described how day—old chicks were
found killed by the effects of heat when a dealer,
who pleaded guilty to two charges of causing un~
necessary suffering to the chicks, was ﬁned a total
of £lO——£5 on each charge. Evidence was given

by two housewives who saw the chicks in the
dealer’s shop window. It was a very hot morning
and the chicks were trying frantically to get out
of the sun. Their beaks were open and all were
gasping. Using a knife the women opened the
door of the shop and one of them removed eleven
dead chicks. Senior Inspector POpe visited the
shop later and found the chicks heaped on top of
one another in a very distressed condition and all

gasping for air. (Cases A5626 and A5650.)

 

‘Fishermen are very apt to make seals the scape;
goats for a scarcity of ﬁsh which may very well be
due to other causes. It should be remembered that
seals have been present on our coasts from time
immemorial during seasons both of scarcity and
abundance of ﬁsh.’

‘There really seems little reason beyond prejudice
for the existence of the traditional trade of the
molevcatcher, and the spectacle of one depart—
ment of a Ministry investigating means of poison—
ing and otherwise destroying moles, while others
are seeking all ways of combating insect pests, is
fantaStic.’

,WHAT HARM HAD HE DONE THEM?

 

 

 

‘The shell had received several fractures

and showed evidence of great violence. . . . One
portion of the shell about 1% inches across had
been forced down and into the soft parts . . .’

This is only part of the description given by
RSPCA Senior Inspector Henderson, when he
presented evidence in support' of case No.
A.6111, at the Nottingham Guildhall Juvenile
Court, against three boys aged twelve, thirteen
and fourteen, charged with cruelly illatreating a
tortoise by unreasonably stoning and injuring
the creature with missiles.

When found, the tortoise attempted to walk,
but could only use the front legs, the back ones
being dragged behind. It was given a humane end.

A lad found the tortoise, then quite sound,
wandering on waste land. He took it to a certain

street, where the three defendants threw stones
and shot at the tortoise with catapults. They
claimed that ‘stuff’ was coming out of the tor;
toise’s mouth and that they decided to put it out
of its misery.

Each of the three boys was fined £1 105. and
was ordered to pay £1 103. costs. The Chairman
of the Magistrates said to them: ‘You must learn
not to cause or do injury to animals.’

Anyone seeing the'picture on this page must be
struck with horror at the thought of this crime.
What harm had such an inoffensive creature done
to these lads? None is the only answer. Then why
did they pelt it with missiles? '

Much cruelty is caused by indifference and negv
lect, but here is an exhibition of wanton cruelty...
Why should these lads have wanted to injure and

bruise a gentle creature, one of nature’s own
masterpieces? Was it the wish to assert power
over something helpless, or the need, arising from
some deep—seated frustration, to cause pain?
Whatever the cause, we are here faced with a
social problem for which we Can only advocate
the spread of enlightened principles. If we can,
as it were, by education, make children enter into
the feelings of animals—put themselves in their
places—surely such incidents will become but
memories of a bad past. To education, by word
and example, the RSPCA pins its faith for the
inculcation of kindness in the young. That is why
the Society’s educational programme has always
been foremost in the general campaign for animal

welfare.

GENEROUS CHILDREN

On my shop counter is a collecting box for the
RSPCA. Women are slightly more generous than
men, who put practically nothing in the box.
Children are astounding. They come in, ask for a
threepenny lollipop—animal shape—look at the
box and say, ‘I’ 11 have a twopenny one’, and put
the penny change in the box. They do this several
times a week—Mrs M. O—RME, 91 Broad Lane,
Tottenham, London, N15.

ANIMALS VIEWED WITH MORE
KINDNESS

After a recent visit by one RSPCA lecturer a
Head Teacher wrote to Headquarters that in this
particular neighbourhood as a result of the ler
tures the children would View animals in a
kindlier way than ever.

Since the last report 150 talks have been given in
schools in Suffolk, Kent, Tilbury, Teignmouth,
Shaldon, Penrith, Wigton, Stretford, Lancaster
and Bolton. Three Animal Defender groups in
Maresfield, Long Melford and Clitheroe, the
lst Orpington Brownie Pack and a group of St
John Ambulance Cadets in Chiswick were also

addressed.

Sixty new Animal Defender groups were
formed; 1,072 children joined the Headquarters
Group. ‘

cat who travelled, unknown to the driver, by van from
Ipswich to London, is seen embarking in London for
the journey home. One Sunday recently, the Hurling-
ham Club, Fulham, telephoned the All-Night Emer-
gency Staff at RSPCA Headquarters to say that the
cat had been found on a van from Ipswich. The
RSPCA looked after the cat and telephoned Inspector
Dennis, stationed in Ipswich, who traced the owner.

WOUND IN STEER’S NECK

Chief Inspector Turner said, in evidence against a man charged at Andover with causing un-
necessary suﬁering to a steer by neglect, that he found on the animal’s neck a wound II in.
long, 2% in. wide at the widest point and l in. deep. He found the steer fastened to a tree by
a chain 6 ft. 4 in. long weighing l2 lb. There was a 56 lb. weight at the foot of the tree. There
were signs that the chain had been in contact with the wound. He said the defendant told him
the animal had been tied to the tree a day and had previously gone about with the weight on
the chain for two or three days. ‘I should say the wound was at least ten days to a fortnight
old, by the condition of it’, said the Inspector. On oath, the defendant denied knowingly
causing the animal to suffer, and he said the weight was one of 28 lb., which the steer could
drag along at the end of the chain. He said that the wound was caused by barbed wire and
happened only two days before the Inspector called. A fine of £l0 was imposed, with :6! I65.
costs. (A.5596.)

HEDGEHOG THROWN TO A DOG

At Wednesbury a 74ayear—old pensioner was

prosecuted by the RSPCA for causing unneceSa

sary suffering to a hedgehog—a captive animal—

3y unreasonably allowing it to be worried by a
og.

The allegation was that the man had deliber—
ately incited his bull terrier to attack the hedge,
hog which he was carrying in a shopping bag.
Witnesses spoke of two occasions. On the first
the defendant took the hedgehog out of the bag,
put it on the ﬂoor and told the dog to bite it. He
then turned the hedgehog over with his foot and
later picked it up and put it in the bag.

The second time two sisters gave evidence of
seeing the defendant put his foot on the back of
the hedgehog so that the head would come out
and the dog could attack it. He threw the hedge—
hog on to some waste ground. The two sisters
recovered the animal and took it for treatment,
but the hedgehog later died.

RSPCA evidence was given by Inspector
Downes.

After the defendant was fined £5 with three

, .,.._.~h_~‘_~«_,

guineas costs he told the Magistrates that he
would go to prison because he could not pay the
fine. The alternative to the fine was a month’s
imprisonment. (A5890) »

TORTOISE SHOT

Two youths aged 16 were brought by the RSPCA
before the Magistrates at Mansfield Juvenile Court
charged with causing unnecessary suffering to a
tortoise by shooting and wounding it.

Evidence showed that one of the boys was seen
shooting as if at a lawn. He was laughing and
handed the gun to the second defendant who
fired it in the same direction.

The witness who saw them doing this looked
to see what they were shooting at and'found a
tortoise which had two holes in the’front of the
shell, one at either side of the neck, and that
blood was coming from the wounds. Both boys
were fined £5 and each of them had to pay
£2 163. 0d. costs.

RSPCA evidence was given by Inspector
Hodgson. The tortoise was given veterinary

treatment. (A5823 .)
