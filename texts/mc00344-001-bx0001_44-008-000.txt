Hypnosis i_rLCrash Analysis

In an experiment performed by USC psychologist Chaytor Mason, the
Civil Aeronautics Board has used hypnosis for the first time to obtain
crash details from an aircraft pilot who suffered temporary memory
loss in the accident. The technique proved so superior to narco-
synthesis—~interrogation while under the influence of so—called

truth serum--that it is unlikely narcosynthesis will be used again.

Under hypnosis the pilot was able to recall all events from the time
he arrived at the airport through the actual failure of the aircraft to
the very moment of impact.

_T__l_1_e Year i_r_1_ Athletics
Enriching its tradition of athletic achievement within a framework
of,academic excellence, the University in 1964—65 won the NCAA
swimming championship, tied for NCAA track honors with the
University of Oregon, and captured the AAWU All- Sports Cup,

‘ given each year to the institution which fares best overall in
football, swimming, basketball, track and field, golf, tennis,
crew, and wrestling.

Pioneer Program in Animal Care

Men and women unable to find jobs with their present skills have
enrolled in the nation's first training program for animal caretakers
being offered by USC‘s Vivarium Department. The 20—week course
in animal care was created by the Federal Manpower Retraining
Program and the Los Angeles Board of Education at the request of a
local committee representing veterinary hospitals, zoos, research
institutions, kennels, and other agencies concerned with animal
care.

Dr. William Blackmore, Director of USC's Vivarium (the department
responsible for all University animal care) directs the training pro-
gram on the medical campus.

FUR CRUSnDa. Is LIVE SKINNING, IN INDIA .

In answer to one of my advertisements asking for information
about natives skinning goats alive in India, I have received the
following communication from a reliable source. fhe writer has
given me permission to publish his letter, and this is what he says~

“ With.reference to your advertisement I write to tell you

that I have been in India since June 1926, and in the closest
intimacy with the peeple, being a superintendent of Labour; but I
have never actually come across a case of a goat being skinned,
probably because I have never been on the-look out for it.

About a year or two ago, I was passing along the main road from
Atur to Salem in a Ford and I noticed two men on the side of the
road apparently holding down a sheep on its back with great difficulty
They had cut the skin away from the throat of an apparently alive
sheep. At the time I thought they were trying to kill the sheep
by cutting its throat with a knife a little larger than a peneknife.
I did not stop,as cruel sights are so common that one gets inured
to them. Moreover I felt I could not hasten the death of the sheep.
On arrival at Salem.I mentioned this occurrence, and was told that
these men were probably skinning the sheep alive, as skin taken off a
live animal stretches a great deal more than that off a dead one.

When lizard skin shoes were in fashion in hngland, many lizards
were skinned alive in India as their skins are very easily stretched
when taken off a live animal. Four years ago I wanted to send live
lizards to England and was told that there would be some difficulty
owing to the fact that the Government had forbidden the export of
skins, I used to keep a large number of wild animals, and so one
day some natives brought me a very large lizard called out there
"undumba" but I believe in England iguanodon. As this animal had
a foreleg broken in capturing it, I told them to kill it and give
me the skin. Had I not objected they would not have hesitated in
skinning it alive for me. ' *

In September 1926, I came down a little river bed near
:Kanghayam, Coimbatore District. There were three or four:men there
with a flock ofb goats. They were Opening the mouths of the goats
and filling them with water. You may know that forcible drinking
was one of the Medieval tortures. I asked what they were doing this £1
for, and was told that the goatsb were to be sold at the local market
7 I have no other personal eXperiances in this line, and as
Iregards live skinning, I may say that the inhabitants are very
careful not to publish the fact that they employ that method. If a
case is reported to the Government, action is taken against the
offenders; but so very seldom can they be caught, and so much.more
profit can be made from liveuskinning than from deadeskinning, that
the punishment inflicted would not act as a deterrent, but would only
make the offenders more careful to do their skinning in quiet
out-of~the—way places. '

If skins are examined on the same day that they are taken from
the sheep's back, an expert can say whether the sheep have been
live—skinned or dead~skinned.

 




(2)

In writing this letter I have been always very careful ton state
what I know to be true and what I have been told. In India thi,
eSpecially, things are very much inclined to be exagerated, or a
deliberate lie told to either hide the teller's ignorance or else

to impress the questioner and to tell him something he would like
to hear.“

In the light of the above I am particularly anxious to know whether
the Bokharan sheep, whose skins are sold as Astrakan,Persian lamb,
Broadtail and Slink, are skinned alive, and I should be grateful
to any traveller who can inform me. The object of my fur crusade
is to prohibit steel gasps,which do not kill instantly, and other
tortures. I now haveAI2O,OOO leaflets,explaining this and also
saying what furs may be worn without undue cruelty, in circulation.
I should be grateful for help in distributing these and also far
any donation towards the expenses.

Major C. VanderByl,
Wappenham House,
Tawcester.

Dear Sir,

Mr. R. S. Forman, Secretary of the Reptile Skin
Marketing Committee, has sent me as Chairman of the
Cammittee, cepies of correSpondence exchanged between you,
regarding the methods adOpted in obtaining Reptile Skins.

In the first place I would like to mention that
this question was raised before the Committee of the
Imperial Institute, of which I am a member, and the
attention of the Trade Commissioner for India was drawn to
this question. U

The fact that there is a law under which Natives
are punished for this offence, is at any rate an important
step in the right direction, should it be true that this
method is adOpted, but Lizards have to be slit Open at the
neck and cut down the belly to enable them.to remove the
skin, and I cannot see it is possible for this to be done
without killing the animal.

As a possible explanation to the report you have
received, in that certain casts in India are not allowed to take
life,thfs, may give some foundation to your report.
should it be correct, I would naturally welcome any steps
that could be taken to prevent this cruel practice.

I censider that the only people who could take the necessary
aegion would be the BSPCA.or the Trade Commissioner for
In» a.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Major Van der Byl,
Thank you for your letter and enclosure.

With regard to the article signed Thevenin, we had
our attention drawn to this some time ago, and eventually
succeeded in getting in touch with the vmrit r in Question.
It aLpears that he obtained the information concerning the
skinning of reptiles from the French scientific magaZine
La Nature issued in December 1908. I enlafraid it would
be useless to cuote such out of date evidence in any publication,
as I am sure you will appreciate.

Yours sincerely,

-~ Cattain
Chief Secretary.
