August 1, 196h I From: Animal Welfare Institute .
22 E. 17th St., New York 3, N.Y.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Phone: OR 5-1069

A central Detroit patrolman to whom crimes of violence are a common
occurrence, was appalled by what he found in Wayne University Medical
School when summoned there on a complaint, He called the condition of an
experimental dog "the worst case of cruelty I have ever seen."

Patrolman John Mobley, who today was named Albert Schweitzer medallist
for 196A by the Animal Welfare Institute, reported: "While working Section lml

with Patrolman Bloomfield, we received a radio run to the Memorial Hospital

about a complaint. Upon arriving, the head nurse at the information desk

stated a dog in the Wayne University Laboratory was moaning and crying for
three hours. It was disturbing the patients at the hospital."

Investigates Basement

 

"We went to the laboratory," Patrolman Mobley continued, "and the night
watchman took us to the basement where we found tn) dogs in steel cribs. One
looked dead, but the other was crying as if in great pain. Blood and foreign
matter was pouring from the mouth. Some of the blood was dry, indicating the
dog was left to suffer some time. The dog seemed paralyzed, and the tongue
was gagging the dog to the point it could not get sufficient air."

39 Care Provided

 

"I asked the nightwatchman," the Patrolman said, "what doctor was in
attendance of the dogs, if they were in a postwoperative state, and he merely
stated that no one watches them, and everyone had gone home. He said they
are only interested in the time it takes before they die." Patrolman Bloomfield
was made ill by the sight. Patrolman Mobley summed up both men's views when he
said, "If this is called for, in the advancement of science, then God help us
all."

Patrolman Mobley called the Anti-Cruelty Association whose investigatien
brought out conflicting reports from medical school personnel, one stating
the dog had died during the night, another that it was still living and had
now been debarked. "Irregularities" noted by the Acting Head of Surgery were
that the dog should have been debarked earlier and should not have been left
in the basement room with a window open.

The matter is under investigation by the Health Commissioner of the

State of Michigan.

 




PATROLMAN MOBLEY'S STATEMENT
"At about 9:30 P.M., on Thursday,
July 9, 196a while wnrking Sct. 1—1
with Patrolman Bloomfield, we received
a radio run to the Memorial Hospital
about a complaint. Upon arriving, the

head nurse at the information desk

stated a dog in the Wayne University. ‘ n f
. V a”:

Laboratory was moaning andtzrying for'k
three hours. It was disturbing the
patients at the hospital. We went to
the laboratory, and the night watchman "a
took us to the basement, Wiere we
found two dogs in steel cribs. one_

looked dead but the other was'crying _,,

as if in great pain. Blood and foreigan

a} *1

***9r was pouring from the mouth..

John Mobley and Lady, the pet he got Some of the blood was dry indicating
"to give a good home to at least one
dog." . the dog was left to suffer some time.

 

"The dog seemed paralyzed, and the tongue was gagging the dog to the
point it could not get sufficient air. I asked the night watchman what
doctor was in attendance of the dogs if they were in a post-operative
state, and he merely stated that no one watches them, and everyone had gone
home. He said they are only interested in the tima it takes before they die.

"If this is called for, in the advancement of science, then GOD HELP

US ALL."

In subsequent interview;, the Acting Chief of Surgery and the doctor
who decided the dog needed nc sedation both took the position that two
"irregularities" had occurred: 1) The dog should have been debarked,

2) The dog should not have been left in the bcsement room with a window
open. One doctor stated that th ciog survived and that it was debarked on
the following day. An animal caretaker stated that it had died during the

night.

August 1, 196A From: Animal Welfare Institute
“22 E. 17th St., New York 3, N.Y.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Phone: OR 5-1069

A central Detroit patrolman to whom crimes of-violence are a common
occurrence, was appalled by what he found in wayne University Medical '
School when summoned there on a complaint. He called the condition of an
experimental dog "the worst case of cruelty I have ever seen."

Patrolman John Mobley, who today was named Albert Schweitzer medallist
for 196A by the Animal Welfare Institute, reported: "While working Section 1-1

with Patrolman Bloomfield, we received a radio run to the Memorial Hospital

about a complaint. Upon arriving, the head nurse at the information desk

“stated a dog in the Wayne University Laboratory was moaning and crying for
three hours. It was disturbing the patients at the hospital."

Investigates Basement

 

"We went to the laboratory," Patrolman Mobley continued, "and the night
watchman took us to the basement where we found tn) dogs in steel cribs. One
looked dead, but the other was crying as if in great pain. Blood and foreign
. matter was pouring from the mouth. Some of the blood was dry, indicating the
dog was left to suffer some time. The dog seemed paralyzed, and the tongue
was gagging the dog to the point it could not get sufficient air."

ﬁg Care Provided

 

"I asked the nightwatchman," the Patrolman said, "what doctor was in
attendance of the dogs, if they were in a post-operative state, and he merely
stated that no one watches them, and everyone had gone home. He said they
are only interested in the time it takes before they die." Patrolman Bloomfield
was made ill by the sight. Patrolman Mobley summed up both men's views when he
said, "If this is called for, in the advancement of science, then God help us
all."

Patrolman Mobley called the Anti-Cruelty Association whose investigation
brought out conflicting reports from medical school personnel, one stating
the dog had died during the night, another that it was still living and had
now been debarked. "Irregularities" noted by the Acting Head of Surgery were
that the dog should have been debarked earlier and should not have been left
in the basement room with a window open.

The matter is under investigation by the Health Commissioner of the

State of Michigan.

Letters to

To the Editor: ‘
The editorial “How Long Must
This Go On?” by R. W. (August
20, 1964) was read with great
interest and I fully appreciate
the attitudes contained in it.

After arduous years of train-
ing and work, most. medical sci-
entists continue to be powerfully
motivated by a deep desire to
ease Suffering and eliminate dis-
ease. None are immune to suf-
fering and perhaps experiment-
alists are the most exquisitely
sensitive. Their life’s work is
dedicated to its exclusion

I have from time to time been
confronted by Similar critiques.
It is always with some trouble
to my soul since I have been!
“guilty” of producing pain. andl
discomfort in some of my labora-
tory subjects. I am very familiar
with the moral pros and cons of
the controversy, as I expect you
‘are. Even though I am certain
of my moral rectitude, the bur»
den is a difficult one.

My purpose in writing is to
consider the certainty that more
restrictive curbs on animal use
in medical research ,will ma-
terially Slow medicine’s. strides
toward mitigating suffering and
disease. Can we reflect on the
possibility that your editorial
which, as We all do, shows con-
cern for laboratory animals may
be instead more cruel than hu-’
mane? I suggest that this as-
peot deserves equal editorial
space. It may be vital to each
or any of our fsamilies,.and this
includes Fido tool

'I am dismayed by the recent

that the reader will not perceive
the incorrect impre "ion as a
result of my comments. I have

"of Wayne State University for;
the past three summers, and inl
those years I have been deep—l
.ly involved in the use and care; ’
of experimental animals. Notl
once have I seen any indication‘ '
of ill-treatment of any sort, and;
the animal’s pain, if any, was” '
always greatly alleviated by thef
utilization of various antibiotics, l
drugs, and anesthesias. May Il
call it to the attention of the
public that the case in point
here, albeitunfortunate, is defi-
nitely not. the rule in an organ-
ization as fine as Wayne, This
was an isolated event, one of
which type couldoccur in virtu-
ally any business or profession.
Is it fair to condemn the Uni—
versity for a simple, unique
case of human error? i
The public should realize that
without the use of these experi~
mental animals, research which
brought about the discovery of
the “Wonder Drugs,” (drugs.
which, no doubt, have made the
lives of many of your readers
much more comfortable), would
never have come to be. Have.

your readers ever pondered in
what state the health of the
world might be if it weren’t for
this vital research? It’s not too
pleasant a thought. Finally, I
sincerely doubt that those who
find this use of animals distaste
ful ever once think of the
events involved in bringing
them their meat for dinner.

Dear Mr. Edgar:

0n Augustzo, 1964, the Grosse
Pointe News published an edi;
t‘orial entitled, “How Long Must
This Go 011?” Which contained
a very serious charge of cruelty
to animals at the School of Med-
icine, Wayne State University,
based on a nationally circulated
statement made by Patrolm’an
Mobley toga Mrs. Dorothy Dyce.

Mr. Wells -/of your staff phoned

Buddy F reidrichs Sweeps

World Series

of Sailing

 

By Frank McBride
The worlds series of sailing,

the North American Yacht Rac—

ing Union finals for the Clif-
ford D. Mallory Trophy was
swept by a sensational bit of
sailing performed by a young
man from New Orleans’ South-
ern Yacht Club. Buddy Freid-
richs placed first in five races,
second in two and third in one
of the eight events.

The gods looked favorably
on the Grosse Pointe Yacht
Club and the local area, weather-
wise, last week when we had
five consecutive days of good
weather. During the week the
weather gave the sailors a well-
rounded bit of sailing from

'heavy going to light air. This
all added up to make a good
test of the crews and boats.

Buddy Freidrichs and his
crew, Tom Dreyfus and Roy
Troendle proved that they were
the champions regardless of
what boat they sailed. After
each race the crews changed
boats so they all sailed once in
each boat. In several races
Freidrichs did not make the
best start and was back in the
pack on the first leg or two of
the race, but by the time the

 

Farms Tankers
Receive Awards

Last Monday night the Grosse
Pointe Farms Swim Club had
its First Annual Banquet, hon-
oring the team as a whole and

its outstanding individual mem-E

bers. Seventy—five members were
there with their parents.

The team came in second—in
the dual meet competition and
scored 169 points in the Inter-
City meet.

Four trophys were donated to
the club and were presented to

boats were on their way home
on the final leg you could count
on Freidrichs being in front.

The boats proved to be even-
ly matched by having only a
lO-point spread from the low-
est to the highest. All of which
proves the Crescent Class boats
to be as close a one design
class in all ways as any around.

The Southern California crew
skippered by Scott Allan with
Henry Sprague III and Lenny
Coon was another young crew
that did very well. Allan’s
father Robert Allan was raised
on Balfour road as a young man.
He has lived most of his life in
California and is one of the
West Coast’s ablest sailors.
John Garrison who was the al—
ternate is a regular member Of
the crew of “Copperhead”
which his father purchased re-
cently from Charles Kotovic
the famous Milwaukee skipper.

At the banquet hosted by the
Grosse Pointe Yacht Club each
crew member was presented
with a Pewter Mug with the
GPYC Burgee on it and en-
graved for the Mallory Finals.
The skipper and crew members
of the first and second boats
Iwere presented with Revere
EBowls by the N.A.Y.R.U. The
‘winning skipper was presented
with the magnificent Mallory
I Trophy to take home for a year.
I Following the presentation

E Lynn Steadman read a telegram

from the U. S. Olympic Com-
,mittee nominating Henry Spra-
Egue III of the Southern Cali-
fornia crew as the Alternate

came as a complete surprise as
Sprague had no prior knowl-
edge of his selection.

The order of finishes is as

First—G. S. Freidrichs,
New Orleans, 61%. points.

Boat Owners

Report Thefts

A thief invaded two boats
docked at the Crescent Sail
Club during the night of Mon-
day, August 31, and escaped
with several valuable articles,
according to information given
to Farms police.

John P. Goetcheus of 5309
Concord, told police that the
thief entered his yawl “Gracie,”
and took a pair of binoculars
valued at $25, and a marine
radio, valued at $100.

Also missing a pair of binocu-
lars, worth $30, is Clark R. Tay-
lor, of 1712 Hawthorne, owner
of the “Wind Song,” who told
police that another ite
guide compass, valued at $25,
was gone from the boat.

Both boat owners said their
crafts were not locked at the
time the thefts occurred.

Fishing Rodeo

Great Success

 

On Saturday, August 29, at
8:30 am, the gun was shot and
George Solomon announced the
start of the 10th annual Farms
and City Fishing Rodeo. The
sun was shining and so were
over 300 youngsters who were
ready to drop their lines into
the water.

The first fish caught was a
61/2-inch bass by Steve Jamer-
ino of the Farms. The first boy

Gary Kronin who landed an
11/2-inch sheephead.

The first girl to catch a fish
was Karen Reinowski from the
Farms who caught a 31/2-inch
bass. The girl anglers of the
City had no luck with their lines
and sinkers and went home
without hooking one fish.

Two girls were tied for catch-
ing the largest fish. Both Mimi
Mulford and Janice Shank
caught 91/2-inch sheepheads and
thus had to share their title.
The last boy to catch a fish was
Mike Mulford and Mike Gotfred-

 

Fourth—Mike Sturgis, Con— , son. Each caught three fish,

Fifth—Richard Sullivan, Sci-
tuate, Mass, 32 points.

 

portant part of becoming a
good swimmer and Craig who
had only missed two practices.
the whole season had shown the I
desire to improve his swimming,
thus winning the award.

The Most Valuable Swimmer
Award in the Inter-City was
awarded to the person who had
scored the most points in the
Inter-City Meet, had kept the
team working together as a unit,
and took the greatest interest in
the individual members of the
team. The person’s attitude was
the most important factor in de- .
termining who should receiveE
the award.

The award was presented to!
Micky Van who is only 14 years g
old yet took a first in the 50]
meter back and a third in the!
25-meter fly in the 16 and under I
age group. She also helped the'
girls relay take a third in theirE
event. ’

The Brideau-NOll Award is
for the most improved swim-
mer on the team. This award
was presented to Virginia
Horne, a nine year old who has
improved her time from 26.0
seconds in her first meet for
25-meter free to 18.3 seconds in
the Inter-City meet. Also taken
into consideration for this
award was the person’s attend-
ance at practices, attitude to-
wards the team and individual
progress in swimming, and how
much she had helped the team
by scoring points.

The award for the Most Valu-
able Swimmer Of the Grosse
Pointe Farms Swim Team was
donated by Grays Sport Shop
and was the most important
award to be presented to a
member of the team. This
award honors the person who
has scored the most points in
the dual meets and Inter-City
competition, the person who
has helped other members of
the team improve their swim-
ming, the person who takes an
active part in developing his
swimming through practice; and
the person who has an attitude
of being part of a working unit
and not just an individual swim-
mer.

The award was presented to
John Fountain who swims in
the 11 and 12 year old age
group. John scored 26 points in
dual meet competition, thus

 

 

 

Sixth—Ted Bowser, Quebec,
Canada, 32% points.

It was now time for the

on top. They won every event in
their Labor Day Championships
and, when it was all over, they
triumphantly threw Coach Hal
Willard in the pool. I

Possibly the reason for such,
a victory after a season of!
straight losses is that everyone
was finally in top shape. Or it
may have been because the only
swimmers competing were from
C.C.D., kind of an Intra-Club
Championships.

Well anyway, there was no
doubt about it . . . Country Club
finished first.

Nearly 60 tankers swam in
the finals which offered races
in every stroke for age groups
ranging from 6-under to 15-16.
The same night at a Swimmer’s
Banquet a trophy was awarded
to the high poi. t winner in each
age group. ‘

Winning the trophies, in or-
der of age, were Kim Fruehauf
(6-under), Lisa Speer (7-8),
Hank Coleman (7-8), Sue Speer
(9—10), Dave Chaplin (9-10),
Lindsay Anderson (ll-12), C. T.
Fisher (11-12), Fran Nutter (13-
14), Steve Hendee (13-14), Marty
Blood (15-16) and Ric Hendee
(15-16). '

But Steve Hendee wasn’t sa-
tisfied . . . no, a trophy wasn’t
enough for him. He also walked
away with “The Most Valuable
Swimmer” Award and( with his
twin sister Nancy), was voted
team captain for next year.

Marty Blood and Ric Hendee,
this summer’s captains, an-
nounced the new leaders and
awarded Coach Hal with a pres-
ent from the team. Mr. Willard
told the swimmers that he will
try to be back as coach again
next season. The kids answered
to this with loud cheering and
whistling.

 

 

 

averaging 8.6 points per meet;

John, in the Inter-City meet,
took a first in the 25-meter
fly, and also helped the boys
relay set a new Inter~City rec-
ord by breaking the old one by
a full second. ’

But most important of all
John’s attendance record shows
why he is such a good swimmer.
He has only missed three prac—
tices during the whole season
and has worked very hard to
improve himself in swimming at
every practice. He has been an
inspiration to all who are on
the team and has ‘carried the
banner Of victory when it has
wavered.

The banquet ended with a
dance contest and dancing con-
tinued the rest of the evening.
A note of thanks goes to all the
parents who helped and also to
Meldrums, Farms Market, Gene’s
Party Store, and to the Grosse
.Pointe Farms Boat Club for
making it a success. All in all
everyone had a good time and
it will be a memorable event to
all who swam this year on the
Grosse Pointe Farms Swim
Team.

'search Building, the operating

Hospital or the School of Medi-
cine (both in immediate proxim-
ity to the laboratory) to report
a noisy dog. This simple proced-
ure would have brought a surg- j

able to access the true circum-
stance and deal with it in a pro-
fessional manner.

To anyone sincerely interested
in the truth, there can be no
doubt that our policy is to pro-
vide first-rate facilities for ani-
mals and to give them the best
possible care and treatment.
This policy has been carried out
successfully for many years and
we are proud of our record,
which is attested to by regular
certification by the State De-
partment of Health over many
years of rigorous and periodic
inspection. This evidence of hu-
mane treatment is available to
anyone who visits our labora-
tories. We have and will con-
tinue the policy of keeping our
animal quarters open at all
times to responSible members of
official societies concerned with
the care and welfare of animals,
and to any others with legiti-
mate interests. The evaluation
report submitted this July by
Doctor L. P. Hedeman of the
State Department of Health
complimented our efforts:

 

ters on the 6th floor Of the Re-

room, and the so-called recovery
room in the basement (this is
the room in which the reported
incident occurred). In general, I
would say that these animals are
receiving excellent preoperative
care. The quarters are especially
clean. The animals are well fed
and show every indication that
they are receiving excellent
care. Most of the cages are ade
quate in size; they have a few
small ones that should be re-
placed. I examined . approxi-
mately one-fourth of the dogs
in the large ward and all the
dogs in the quarantine area, and
in every instance when the cage
doors were opened the dogs
would come right to me to be
petted showing that they were
used to this treatment rather
than shivering in the cage or
growling or snapping, indicating
that they have been abused.”

Finally, a word about the,
charges” to which we have been?
sunjected. False charges areE
damaging. They take time to re- i
fute and the refutation never
receives the same publicity. No
matter what is said and done, a
certain number of people re-
main unconvinced because they
were anxious to believe the orig-
inal charge and are unwilling or
unable to make an objective
analysis.

The societies who distributed
the publicity acted in a manner
that convinces me they are not
interested in the truth. The al-

Detroit patrolman, John

His complaint of cruelty to anim

 

Cop With a Heart

By Eleanor Avery Price

OMAGE has been paid
to dog heroes of 1964,
so now, at the close of the
year, let us commend the
man of the year who won

" the Albert Schweitzer medal

for 1964 presented by the
Animal Welfare Institute.
His'name is John Mobley, a
central Detroit patrolman,
to whom crimes of violence
amOng humans are common

but a man who was so ap-
palled by what he found in
a university medical school
that he called it “the worst
case of cruelty I have ever
seen.”

The following is Mobley’s
report. “While working Sec-
tion 1-1 with Patrolman
Blomfield, we received a
radio run to a hospital about
a complaint. Upon arriving,
the head nurse at the infor-
mation desk stated that a
dog in a (certain) laboratory

was moaning and crying for _,

three hours; It was disturb-
ing the patients at the hos-
pital.

“WE WENT to the labora-
tory and the night watch-
man took us to the base-
ment where we found two
dogs in steel cribs, One ap-
peared dead, but the other
was crying as if in great
pain. (Description omitted
here by the writer to spare
young readers.) I asked the
night watchman what doctor

was in attendance of the
dogs, if they were in a post
operative state, and he mere-
ly stated that no one watch-
es them, and everyone had
gone home.” (Their only in-
terest being how long the
animals would live.)
Patrolman Mobley called
the Anti-Cruelty Association
and subsequent investiga~
tion brought forth conflict-
ing reports. The matter, of
course, was put under in-
vestigation by the Health
Commissioner of the State
of Michigan. But the ques-
tion remains: is this medical
advancement?

FOLLOWING Mobley’s
complaint of cruelty, he
adopted a pet in order to
give a good home to at least

one dog. Perhaps some of

you can follow his example.
Many dogs await homes at
various shelters. But they
can’t wait long, as they

 

 

 

 

 

 

must be removed to make.
room for new ones. Some
are purebred, others mix-;
breeds, but most have lov- -
ing hearts and make good;

for mention of cruel forms

A central Detroit patrol-
man to whom crimes of
violence are a common oc-
currence, was appalled by
what he found in Wayne Uni-
versity Medical School when
summoned there on a com-
plaint. He called the condi-_
tion of an experimental dog
."the worst case of cruelty I

tinued, “and the night watch-
man took us to the basement
where we found two dogs in
steel‘cribs. One looked dead,
but the other was crying as
if in great pain. Blood and
foreign matter was pouring
from the .mouth. Some of
the blood was dry, indicating
the dog was left to suffer for
some time. The dog seemed
paralyzed, and the tongue was
gagging the dog to the point
it could not get sufficient air . ’ '

“I asked the nightwatch-
man," the patrolman said,
“what doctor was attending
the'dogs, if they were in a
post-operative state, and he
merely stated that no one
watches them, and everyone
had gone home. He said they
are only interested in the time
it takes before they die.”

Patrolman Bloomfield was
made ill by the sight. Patrol-

 

man Mobley summed up both
men'syviews when he said, “if
this‘gis called for, in the ad-
vancement of . science, then
Godjhelp us all.”

it onto a blanket, a small

within your power to avoid
changing its position and re-
frain from jostling it as much

BREED OF THE WEEK:
YORKSHIRE TERRIER . . .
True enough, it is classified
as a member of the toy group.
The Skye,- the Manchester and

the Dandie Dinmont are fac-

tually known to be his ances-
tors. Some authorities go a

step further in their belief '
there isanot too distant rela-

tionship with the huge

Airedale.

Like the Doberman pin?-
scher and the Bull mastiff,

the Yorkshire terrier is a

manmadebreed that, is

337411; -' . ,-

dogs of. different breeds were

, crossed and recr-ossed and the
! blood of several combined to

make the Yorkie a definite and
separate type, which would
breed trUe to form.

The Yorkshire terrier’s

eye-catching colored, ﬂowing
silky coat is completely dis-
tinctive. Small as it is, the
Yorkshire's temperament is
truly comparable to a terrier,
active, playful and alert at all

f times .

The Yorkie tips the scales
at about '7 pounds and reaches
height of eight inches. ,

Next week, we’ll bring you
a profile on the rarist of all
breeds, theXoloitzcuintli.

According to a close observer of Lynda’s
romance, the . constant. questions about her
wedding date may have had a lot to do with its
final cancellation. It wasn’t just the press who
asked Lynda when she was going to be
married, it was every Senator and Senator’s
wife, every Congressman and Congressman’s
wife, etc. The queries from friends, not the
press, Luci now faces in the months ahead
could, thinks the same observer, dampen her
ardor also.

Come to think of it, although their upbring-
ing was as different asany average American
girl’s would be from that of a princess in
Buckingham Palace, Luci and Princess Mar-
garet have some things in common. Both of
them have proper older sisters who do what’s
expected of them. Both have a pixie quality of
unpredictability that keeps their own circles
buzzing. Both have made the news just by
doing the latest dances. Both are targets for
cameramen. And both have insisted on being
themselves.

Luci in an effort to be just that disguised
herself once in a blonde wig. Princess Marga-
ret, who has raised eyebrows with her decol-
lete gowns and pub crawling, frequently
disguised herself when she went out with
Antony Armstrong-Jones during his courtship.

WASHINGTON SOCIETY was caught by
surprise when it learned that the private, late,
gay swinging party Princess Margaret and the
Earl of Snowdon would attend in Washington
on the night of Nov. 16 would be given by
Attorney General and Mrs. Nicholas Katzen-
bach at the request of the British Embassy. If
you had asked someone in the very social or
official circles in Washington to name the most
successful or most publicized Capital hostess-
es, the chances are none would have men-
tioned Lydia Katzenbach. Yet those who have
been to her parties wax eloquent. “She has a
flair,” said a friend. “Her parties are easy and
relaxed, the conversation is marvelous, the
food is always excellent and the people always
interesting. She is individualistic and you feel
that the way she sees life is different and she
makes you see it that way. She loves poetry.

She loves art. She hates phonics. She has a .

brilliant mind. She is very amusing and is
outspoken in a. delicate way.”

She sounds made to order for the offbeat
Snowdons. Indeed, Mrs. Katzenbach is the
most offbeat member of the cabinet circle.
She is the only one, so far as I know, who ever
sported a pair of very pink heavy lace stock-
ings at a party. The British would call these
stockings “mod,” whether short for modern or
broad “A” for mad I wouldn’t know. Princess
Margaret was photographed in a mod costume
wearing heavy black stockings last January
when she and her husband were enroute to
Paddy Burke’s pub in Clarenbridge, Ireland.

A native Washingtonian, Mrs. Katzenbach
is» a member of a socially prominent and well-
to-do family in the East. She isthe daughter of
Harold Phelps Stokes, formerly of the editorial
board of the New York Times, and Elizabeth
Miner King Stokes, who once wrote for the
New York Post and has published some of her
poetry in the Saturday Review of Literature.
Lydia also writes poetry and prose but hasn’t
tried to publish any of it yet. '

Her family is also strongly Episcopalian.
Her uncle was the late well-known Anson
Phelps Stokes, canon in the Episcopal Church,
and her first cousin by the same name is the

\Bishop of Massachusetts.

' LIZ CARPENTER spoke to the Holtdn.

Arms students on Parents Day recently and
struck a responsive cord with the girls when
she said, “Parents are, of course, the source of
so much misinformation. They are the kind of
creatures who think:

The Brothers Four are a new set of
quadruplets; ‘ , .
That the Rolling Stones are movmg
pebbles;
That “Weejuns” are a tribe of baby
Indians;
That a Stingray is a fish;
That irons are for shirts-not hair;
That Ringo Starr is a small constella-
tion near the Big Dipper.”
The girls loved it.

Just in case you didn’t know, the big rage
with this age is to iron the hair. Whereas once
every girl wanted curly locks, now she wants
it straighter than straight and the only way
she can get it that way is to get a friend to put
a hot, flat iron on it. They claim it also gives it

more body and sheen.-

Mrs. Carpenter learned about it, she said,
when she chaperoned her daughter and a
group 'of girls at the seashore last summer and
found ironing boards all over the place. She
beamed happily, thinking what neat friends
her daughter had that each one was so eager
to have a freshly pressed dress for the eve
ning. But, no, all the ironing board setups were
presses for their tresses.

She wound up giving them some very good
advice.

Maury someone who will encourage you in
your enterprises. Avoid those ungainly types
who are eager to whisper, ‘Where did you get
those great brown eyes and that tiny mind?’ ”

ABE FORTAS, newest Justice of the
Supreme Court, will be awarded the Albert
Schweitzer Medal of the Animal Welfare
Institute the afternoon of Nov. 20. The award
will be made at the home of Presidential
Assistant and Mrs. Roger Stevens who leased
the beautiful Gerogetown residence of our
Ambassador to Great Britain and Mrs. David
K. E. Bruce. Christine Stevens is president of
the Animal Welfare Institute and the American
woman who has probably done the most to try
to get a law passed that will eliminate the
needless suffering of those animals that must
be used in experimental laboratories

Justice Fartas, a long time adviser of the ‘

Institute and the Society for Animal Protective
Legislation, had much to do with the passage
of the Federal Humane Slaughter Act in 1958.
He also wrote the bill to require humane
treatment of experimental animals which is
now pending in the US. Senate sponsored by

Dr. Schweitzer once said of the bill Justice
Fortas wrote: “If you pass such a law in the
United States, it will have important meaning
for the world. The law will then gain recogni-
tion in other nations, too.”

First recipient of the Schweitzer Medal .

was Dr. Schweitzer himself in Oslo when he
received the Nobel Prize for Peace. Other
recipients have been Vice President Humphrey
and Rachel Carson. .. ,

A gold. copy was presented
to Dr. Schweitzer when he
received the Nobel Prize for
Peace in Oslo.

Erica Anderson, photogra-
pher-author who made two
films on Schweitzer and his
hospital at Lambarene and
has written two books on the
same subject, came from New
York to make the formal
presentation.

Mrs. Stevens presided,
Stevens introduced Mrs.
Anderson, and a brief ort
was made by Mrs. R ert
Dyce oi Michigan, laboratory
animal consultant -to the
institute. ‘

Bill Pending

The pending bill for humane
treatment of animals is ‘based
on a British act which was
strongly supported by British
. scientists, Mrs. Stevens said.

Although she sees a “hard
fight ahead” ior its passage,
she is confident that it will
succeed, once the legislation
is understood.

Passage of the Federal
Humane Slaughter Act in 1958
owed mush to Justice Fortes
efforts and it was at his
suggestion, Mrs. Stevens
noted, that the Society for
Animal Protective Legislation
was organized." '

With the latter functioning
as. a lobbying group,

: institute maintains its charac-
ter as an educational body.
In accepting the medal,
' Justice Fortes responded with
‘ quiet eloquence about Schweit-
zer’s philosophy:
2 “He taught us that one may
“ think, profoundly, realistical-
1 ly, and caustically with the
;ireedom without which
j thought is a shameful, tawdry
» exermse.”

In the field of humane education, our free teachers' manuals, Eugene Biology
Projects and First Aid and gage 9;.Small.hninals, written by Ernest'Walker, the
distinguished author of the classic, Mammals cg the Egg;§,continue to be in
demand in all parts of the country, as are numerous smaller publications which
we also supply'without charge to school teachers. A new book, Studying Our Fellow
Mammals, also by Mr. Walker, is now in press. Through this program of publication
and distribution on request by teachers, we seek to encourage informed, humane
attitudes and to discourage cruelty insofar as this is possible through purely
educational means.

Animals and 2hgir_Legal Rights is nearing completion by Emily Leavitt, Who
began the book two years ago and is now working under a grant to finish the research

and writing on animal protective laws in our countryb-a subject which has not had

 




comprehensive coverage for more than forty years. Few Americans know what laws

we have on animals or how we compare with other nations” Generally speaking, we

are embarrassingly'far behind most of the western European democracies in this

field.

Much of the Institute's educational work is focused on scientific instituw

tions for whom.we publish free manuals on Basic Care g; Exogrinental.inimals and
Comfortable Quarters for Laboratogz.Animals. About thirty thousand of these
manuals have been provided free on request to laboratories by the Institute, and
we provide other educational.materials at cost”

However, it has been a sad experience to find that the simple provision of
practical information is very far from adequate to obtain decent treatment of
experimental animals. For the past fourteen years, representatives of the lnsti~
tute have visited laboratories and given firstuhand advise; and two years ago a
special laboratory animal consultant service was instituted through the gift of a
generous donor. Mrs. Dyes, who began as assistant to the AWI Laboratory‘snimal
Consultants, Mr. Kind and Dr. Carding, has now assumed the full duties; and she

was appointed this year by the Governor of the State of Michigan to serve on the

 




Advisory Committee on the Humane Use of.Animals, created by a unique law in that
state. Mrs. Dyes has brought about major changes in the care and housing of ani~
male in several Michigan laboratories through presentation of thorough reports to
the Michigan State Health Commissioner, Dr. Albert Heustis, a medical man who has
not hesitated to take firm, fair action to stop abuses. Mrs. Dyce will tell you
some of the findings both in.Michigan and in states where legal machinery is lack-
ing to prevent even the most obvious callousness and neglect.

The AWI has always worked closely with the Universities Federation for Animal
Welfare in Britain, whose intellectual approach has succeeded in uniting the humani-
tarian with the scientific viewpoint. It has enlisted humane scientists to work
actively for animal welfare. For example, Sir Peter Medawar, winner of the 1960
Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine, was chairman of UFAW‘s scientific advisory

committee for years.

It was through the good offices of UEAW'S founder that arrangements were made

for Sir Graham Wilson and Dr. Lawrence Abel to come to the United States this

September to tell a Congressional Committee about the soundness of the British

Cruelty to Animals Act which regulates animal experimentation, and to answer questions

 




on its actual operation. Sir Graham, recently retired as director of the Public
Health Laboratory Service, and Dr. Abel, consulting surgeon to the Institute of
Cancer Research, Royal Cancer Hospital, and formerly'Vice-President of the Royal
College of Surgeons, could report on the Act from different scientific and adminiu
strative standpoints; and they, like the overwhelming majority of British scientists,
are supporters of this humane law which has done such a remarkable job of prevent»

ing needless suffering in laboratories without hampering scientific research.

The hearings at which Sir Graham and Dr. Abel testified took place September

30th; and the bill written by Justice Fortes, and modeled on the basic principles

of the British.Act, was under consideration by the Committee, together with numerous
other bills, which, not surprisingly, are less effective and less well drafted“

All of them are attempts of one kind or another to compromise the bill which Justice
Fortas wrote in 1960 and modified in the light of hearings held in 1962 to make it
even more practical and effective. His work gains further endorsement from the
publication of the Littlewood Report, the result of an exhaustive twouyear study

I by a governmental committee which strongly affirms the principles of the British

Act and makes recommendations for further improvements, some of which had already

 




been incorporated in the bill that Justice Fortes wrote.

The chief Senate sponsor of the bill is Senator Joseph Clark; and he was
joined by Senators Bartlett, Byrd, Muskie, and Young. In the House of Representa—
tives, the companion bill is sponsored by the Republican Congressman from New
Hampshire, James C. Cleveland. Great credit is due the sponsors, who are under
constant pressure to weaken and give up their efforts for a sound, effective bill.

It was encouraging to hear Dr. Shannon, Director of the National Institutes
of Health, which distributes over a billion dollars each year for research, most
of which uses animals, state at hearings that he experienced no bureaucratic inter-
ference whatsoever when he did research under the British.Act thirty years ago.
The only objection he voiced was the difference in size between the two countries.

But the British Act has comfortably accommodated the expansion from a few hundred

experiments when it was first enacted.to more than four million last year, and the

Clark and Cleveland bills were drafted to fit conditions in our country. 'we hope,
therefore, that Administration study of the legislation will bring a favorable
report. In no other way can we hope to stop the grim abuses that are taking place

in laboratories throughout the country.

 




For those who are interested, further information on the work of the Inotituto

is to be found in the fourteanth annual report, copies of which you are invitod to

take. You will also see samples of some of the AWE maﬁoriols on tho table at the

door; and Dr. Orlans, of the Instituto’s Advisory Committeo,.Mrs. ﬂyoog Christobol

Stevens, my daughter, and I will all be happy to answer questions aftor tho award”

ing of the medal. Now I will call on Mrs. ﬁyoo, AWE Laboratory Animal Conaoltamt

for a brief report.

 




Thank you Mrs” Stevens“ Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen - members and

friends of the Animal'Welfare Institute. I am grateful to have this opportunity

to report to you briefly and informally on some of our laboratory visits.
M‘

Since January of 196% Mr‘ Kind, Dr. Carding, and I have visited e332§1:§1§_
eager institutions which use animals for experimental purposes. we have seen
w wwﬁ—

shocking evidence of abuse and needless suffering-~much of it due to ignorance,
WWI-DD ”N? a“

negligence, indifference and a callous disregarg for the animals.

Although a staggering amount of money is granted each year for medical

researchw~this year over a billion dollars in Federal funds~~callousness and

cruelty in laboratories continues to grow. And it will continue to increase
W Inn—III. F—u—un—II-I—

because more and more animals are being used each year.

ﬁgge dogs are sgueezed into cages so small that they can not lie gay? or
stand erect. Sometimes the cages are stacked three high-«froathe floor.to the

ceiling, It is a common and accepted practice to keep dogs confined like this

” I“

for years with no runways or exercise space available.
“aw ___.._ I, A

It is also common practice to clean the cages with the dogs in tﬁem. OEen

~m—w

heart surgery and other major surgical procedures are practiced on dogs in the

 




Surgery‘Department of washington University School of Medicine. When Dr. Carding

a”

and I visited this institution in January of this year, we watched the caretaker
as he hosed the cages with the dogs in them. The room was filled with steam and
we watched the dogs as they picked up their feet in an effort to dodge the hot

s2531,_ Others, too sick to have, or too tired to care, just sat there in quiet

resignation. An open area in this room could, with the single and ineapensive

 

an“.

a r . a a" ' ‘a .la
addition of some fencing, be converted into a dog run approx1mately L Wide and

25' long. We made this suggestion to the doctor in charge, but she said she was

M

 

-—q—

satisfied with the dog room and would not consider any modifications. This same

 

doctor said she_did not give the post~operative animals any drugs to relieve their

.9. I've-Mm...“

pain ecause she felt they didn’t need it. After major surgery the animals are

put back in their cages. ﬁg;bedding is provided and the animals are left to

 

recover as best they can. As soon as the animals are received in this medical
r "— W

school, their vocal aﬁords are cut so they can not bark. The debarhina is done

by an attendant who received no formal training for this surgery, This same man

ﬂ

 

administers anesthesia to the dogs and other animals which are used in experimental
M II— M

”

surgery. 'When I asked him how much training he had received, he said, “None, I

just picked it up."

 




On one of our visits to Northwestern University Medical School, we saw two
dead dogs in cages and a caged dog that appeared to be moribund. The dog was
M W

lying on the metal floor of his cage, which was covered with blood and discharge

M M

—‘

draining from a large surgical incision. The incision was not dressed and since

”
W!

no bedding was providedmugot even a newsna er--it was in direct contact with the

r—

cage floor, The dog had no identificationmuthere was nothing on the cage to

7’

denote the type of surgery or the name of the scientist. In answer to our questions,
Wm WM F" own—III—

the Associate Dean said, "Don't prejudge this case. I do not know definitely, but

I think the investigator may have given the dog a transplanted liver to test whether
certain drugs will delay rejection of transplanted tissues. The investigator may
only be interested in how long the dog can survive.”

Time does not permit me to describe the many abuse§_we have seen in our
*9 e

laboratory visits. The few examples which I have cited are typical of the mal-

m

treatment and neglect which is all too prevalent in the many scientific institu-

v—n

tions which are suoEorted totallXLor in part by Federal funds,

Dogs are not the only animals suffering from needless cruelty-~cats, monkeys,

M

rats, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, chimpanzees, baboons, and other animals are

equally mistreated.

 




-4-

I have seen Chimpanzees and Baboons crowded into cages so narrow that

W

they could not turn around.

I have seen.monkeys with implanted electrodes_in their brains restrained

 

so that they could not sit down or lie down because of a heavy lucite

yoke-type collar around their necks. They could not move forward or backward.
M a—-—'____......—-—~ WK»

They could only take a step or two to either side. They were restrained‘

 

 

 

in this unbelievable fashion for a period of two to three months. I asked
.ml _ .__

W".

the doctor why the monkeys cnuld not be released at night so they could have

4’“,

some freedom of movementﬁwhen they are not being used. He said that this would

i.“—

 

not be practical because they would be too hard to catch in the mornings. I

am wondering if he did not mean that it would be too much trouble.

whrough persistent efforts, we have been able to bring about some
improvements in the cage and housing of laboratory animals, but it is
unrealistic to think that any full—scale improvements will be made until a

federal law is passed.
”‘W‘ --""""""“"

Michigan is one of the few states which has a law pertaining to the
M —--"' M

humane use of experimental animals. As a member of the Adyisgry ngmittee

for the Humane Use of Laboratory.Animals, I visit laboratories in Michigan

and send a report of my'findings to the State Commissioner of Health. The

Commissioner sends a State Veterinarian to the laboratory to check on all

 

reported findings. 939 hospital laboratory was closed and three others were
put on probation. ,ﬂt one of these hospitals the post:§ur_ cal re

convention of the Animal Care Panel the grogp of veterinarians and commercial %
suppliers to laboratories which is seeking to persuade our government that

Hazzard, who raises and boards dogs for medical research, was convicted

and fined for cruelty to animals on November 12th and was again arrested_

this past Thursday on the same charge.

Dr. Mary Baxter, an English research veterinarian, testified in court

that she had performed bone_graft efperiments_on the puppies, She also

 

testified that she "stopped almost daily at the Hazzard kennels and found

nothing objectionable." She had worked at another leading veterinary college,

by the University of Pennsylvania.

Had she remained in Britain where the law preventsgoruelty inside as

 

well as outside laboratories, this needless suffering would not have been
inflicted, nor would it have been permitted had the bill written by

Justice Fortas been in effect in our country.

One of the chief suppliers of dogs to Chicago_laboratories is William
Hargorve who is in business with his father. The Hargroves have two dog
farms - one in Illinois and one in Tennessee. In October of this year

there was a little mud in some rusty containers which was supposed to serve

as water. Some of the dogs were so sick they could not stand on their

feet. A small dead dog was lying in the dirt -- the live dogs walking

around him. The pens have no flooring - just dirt. I found skulls

The former Mayor of Medina told me that theHargroves had left the dogs

ERx ERSON PRESENTS . E331;
' ‘ 0 JUSTICE FORTAS/

The Schvs'eitzer Medal of the Animal ‘Welfare Institute
was presented to Associate Justice of the Supreme Court,
Abe Fortas, on November 20th. Erica Anderson, author of
the beautiful new ”Schweitzer Album” and maker of two
films of Dr. Schweitzer’s life and work, presented the
medal to Justice Fortas. She said:

”I am deeply grateful and honored to present the Albert
Schweitzer Medal of the Animal Welfare Institute to you,
Mr. Justice Fortas.

“You have kept your heart open to the silent pleas of
animals and you have worked untiringly to alleviate their
pain. If it had not been for your efforts the Humane
Slaughter Bill might not have passed in 1958. It is due
to your thought and advice that hundreds of millions of
animals are now protected in slaughter houses.

”You wrote the bill of which Dr. Schweitzer said: ‘If
you pass such a law in the United States it will have im-
portant meaning for the world. The law will then gain re-
cognition in other nations too.’

”In his writings about the relationship of Man to
Creature Dr. Schweitzer said ‘No one should close their
eyes to save themselves from seeing the suffering animals
are unnecessarily subjected to. No one should make light
of the share of responsibility each of us carries. As long
as mistreatment of animals occurs in the world all of us
are guilty.’ _

"I thank you, Mr. Justice Fortas, with all my heart for
keeping Dr. Schweitzer’s ideals alive.

”Through you and people like you ‘Reverence for all
Life’ will become a reality in our time.”

Remarks of Mr. Justice F ortas on The Occasion

of The Presentation of The Albert Schweitzer
Humanitarian Award — November 20, 1965

Beyond any possibility of expression, I am deeply grate-
ful to all of you —— to Mrs. Stevens and the Animal Wel-
are Institute —— for this award of the Schweitzer medal.

It is profoundly true that I do not believe that I am
worthy of it. My performance has fallen far short of the
need; my dedication has not approximated the importance
of the cause.

The cause which yOu serve is great, indeed. It is not
just the cause of animals. It is the cause of mankind — of
religion —— of humanity — of life.

For life is a seamless web. It connects us not merely
with one another, but with all that is sentient —— with all
that shares its miracle of birth and feeling and death.

This, I think, was the meaning of Albert Schweitzer.
This, I think, was the reason why he, perhaps more than
anyone in history, was complete. This, I think, is the
reason why he, perhaps above all others, represents to us
the deeply felt but darkly unknown beginning; the dime
perceived meaning; and the vague and shadowy end of
the awesome human journey.

He taught us that one may think, profoundly, realistical-
ly, and caustically with the freedom without which thought
is a shameful, tawdry exercise ———- that one may think and
nevertheless feel, deeply, emotionally and even sentiment-
ally. He taught us that one’s mind may be a scalpel -—
sharp and unyielding, and that its cutting edge is not
blunted by compassion and tenderness and comprehensive
love. He was, I say, complete ——- unafraid of the mys-
teries of life and unashamed of the apparent contradic-

tions of pain and. reverence, of prof-ottad belief and. pro-
found doubt, of life and death. -— He walked alone, as
a man must walk; and he walked hand in hand with all
of life, as a great man must.

In Erica Anderson’s beautiful book, ”The Schweitzer Al-
bum,” there is a report of a question and of this great
man’s answer which illuminates his capacity to endure the
contradictions of our existence —— to draw from these
contradictions not frustration, but strength and a renewal
of dedication.

”How is it,” he was asked, “amid all the suffering of
men on the earth and the suffering of animals on the
earth —— for instance, in laboratory experiments —— that
there is the useful pain which causes good, and useless
pain which leads to nothing?”

And he answered: ”Monsieur, do not ask me to discuss
now the great problem of experiments on animals. I am
not prepared, and it is a difficult question. Most important
of all, and this is what we judge as progress, is that
those who perform them should be aware of the terrible
responsibility of their experiments. And we all, when we
see suffering, must be challenged by a desire for redemp-
tion, to help all creatures. There is always mystery, we
move within the mist of a great mystery: the mystery of
pain. And we come to be always conscious of our great
responsibility to alleviate it.”

At another time and place, here is what he said:

”That fragmentary moral of concern for human life
alone was like a. single tone floating in the air, incom-
plete because the base tone to produce the harmony was
missing. Reverence for life gives us the full chord, the
harmony. The roots of the philosophy of reverence for life
are big and strong, deeply planted, so that the tree can
grow without being hurt by storms.”

This, it seems to me, is a fundamental truth. Unless
there is an awareness of life’s vastness, its unity and its
mystery, there is nothing to life and living except a series
of events. Without this awareness, there is no fOundation,
no ”base tone,” for philosophy, for religion or poetry or
music —- or for political idealism. And this awareness
requires — it does not merely tolerate —— it requires that
it be comprehensive, that it include all of life, not merely
part —~ that it include all creatures that share in the
mystery.

You will see that I have talked with you about funda-
mentals, although I am a practical man. You will observe
that I have not talked with you about the waste and
the inefficiency and the sheer practical idiocy of man’s in-
humanity towards other creatures and I particularly in-
clude the shortsightedness of many who profess to serve
man through science and medicine. ~—- You know and I
know that these exist — and that they are powerful reasons
for the great work upon which you are engaged.

‘But beyond this and above it, the reason which sup-
ports and impels this work is the Schweitzer principle ——
that the achievement of a good society, the realization
of the ideals and purposes of our life, our religion and
our philosophy, is impossible except on a total basis ~—
upon. a basis which includes not only man but all living
creatures. And as Schweitzer teaches us, we need not —-—
we must not be dismayed or deterred by the inherent
and inescapable contradictions with which life confronts
us. The essential point is that we do what we can with
what we have; and that whatever we do is illuminated
and inspired by reverence for life and profound com—
passion."

Albert Schweitzer Annual Award
to Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas

Judge F ortas’ Memorable Remarks Should be Read by All Who

Are Interested in Animal Welfare

BEYOND any possibility of expression,
I am deeply grateful to all of you—to
Mrs. Christine Stevens and the Animal
Welfare Institute—for this award.

It is profoundly true that I do not be!
lieve that I am worthy of it. My perform,
ance has fallen far short of the need; my
dedication has not approximated the im/
portance of the cause. The cause which
you serve is great indeed. It is not just
the cause of animals. It is the cause of
mankind—of religion, of humanity, of
life. For life is a seamless web. It cone
nects us not merely with one another but
with all that is sentient, with all that
shares its miracle of birth and feeling and

death.

This, I think, was the meaning of Albert
Schweitzer. This was the reason why he,
perhaps more than anyone in history, was
complete; the reason why he, perhaps
above all others, represents to Us the
deeply felt but darkly unknown beginning,
the dimly perceived meaning and the
vague and shadowy end of the awesome
human journey.

He taught us that one may think, pro/
foundly, realistically, and caustically with
freedom, without which thought is a
shameful, tawdry exercise—that one may
think and nevertheless feel, deeply, emo’
tionally and even sentimenztally. He taught
us that one's mind may be a scalpel—
sharp and unyielding—if its cutting edge
is not blunted by compassion, tenderness
and comprehensive love. He was, I say,
complete—unafraid of the mysteries of
life and unas‘hamed of the apparent con’
tradictions of pain and reverence, of pro’
found belief and profound doubt, of life
and death. He walked alone, as a man
must walk, and he walked hand in hand
with all of life, as a great man must.

In Erica Anderson’s beautiful book, the
Schweitzer Album, there is a report of a
question, and of this great man’s answer
that illuminates his capacity to endure
the contradictions of our existence, to
draw from these contradictions—not frus’
tration—but strength and a renewal of
dedication.

“How is it,” he was asked “amid all the
suffering of men on the earth and the
suffering of animals on the earth—for
instance, in laboratory experiments—that
there is the useful pain that causes good,
and useless pain which‘leads to nothing?”

He answered, “Monsieur, do not ask
me to discuss now the great problem of
experiments on animals. I am not pre’
pared, and it is a difficult question. Most
important of all—and this is what we
judge as progress—is that THOSE WHO
PERFORM THEM SHOULD BE
AWARE OF THE TERRIBLE RESPON’
SIBILITY OF THEIR EXPERIMENTS.

And we all, when we see suffering, must

be challenged by a desire for redemption,
to help all creatures. There is always
mystery. We move within the midst of a
great mystery: the mystery of pain. And
we come to be always conscious of our
great responsibility to alleviate it.”

At another time and place, here is what

he said:

“That fragmentary moral of concern
for human life alone was like a single
tone ﬂoating in the air, incomplete be
cause the base tone to produce the hare
mony was missing. Reverence for life
gives us the full chord, the harmony. The
roots of the philosophy of reverence for
life are big and strong, deeply planted, so
that the tree can grow without being hurt
by storms.” This, it seems to me, is a
fundamental truth.

Unless there is an awareness of life’s
vastness, its unity and its mystery, there
is nothing to life and living except a
series of events. Without this awareness,
there is no foundation, no “base tone”
for philosophy, for religion, poetry or
music, or for political idealism. And this
awareness requires—it does not merely
tolerate—it requires that it be compre’
hensive, that it includes ALL OF LIFE,
not merely part—that it includes all
creatures which share in the mystery.

I have talked with you about funda/
mentals, although I am a practical man.
You will observe that I have not talked
with you about the waste, the inefficiency
and the sheer practical idiocy of man’s
inhumanity toward other creatures—and
I particularly include the shortsightedness
of many who “profess” to serve man
through science and medicine. (You know
and I know that these people exist—and
that THEY are the powerful reasons for
the great work upon which you (humane
people) are engaged.

But beyond this and above it, the
reason that supports and impels this
(humane) work is the Schweitzer principle
——~that the achievement of a good society,
the realization of the ideals and purposes
of our life, our religion and our philos-
ophy, is impossible except on a total basis
———upon a basis that includes not only man
but ALL living creatures. And as
Albert Schweitzer teaches us, we need
not—we MUST not—be dismayed or
deterred by the inherent and inescapable
contradictions with which life confronts
us. The essential point is that we do all
we can with what we have; and that
whatever we do is illuminated and inspir-
ed by reverence for life and profound
compassion.

Editor’s Note: Please reread the above
remarks again and again—for comfort, fo
inspiration. And please send a copy
any and all people who are cruel
indifferent to animals.

About Town

I WAS warned (and passed the warning on
to you) that you never make “just one trip”
to Puerto Rico where the sun always shines.
We arrived on Christ”
mas Eve in torrential
rain and the thought of
having left banks of
snow and below’2ero
temperatures behind, just
a few hours before, was
poor consolation then!
However, by the time we
had settled in our hotel
and made the bold at!
tempt to unpack, the
skies had all cleared and the same wonderful,
previous, exciting experiences soon began.

If you brown easily, this is the island for
you; even if you do not, you soon will. So
I say again, “Go to Puerto Rico and enjoy
the many interesting things it has to offer.”
Apart from gay San Juan, there are many
miles to drive to see some of the most beauti/
ful country and scenery—through fascinating
towns and villages. Meet some of the friendlir
est people in the world.

You may wonder what this all has to do
with dogs. I can guarantee you will not get
in or out of the island without being welz
comed and entertained by some of the grand’
est dog people you could meet anywhere. In
just moments, MRS. HARLEY MILLER will
convince you that you must attend their
shows, always held in May and October; you
will be put on the mailing list of “Dogs in
Puerto Rico” and be told, and rightly so, of
the potential market on the island for Ameri’
can dogs. I will venture to substantiate any/
thing that Mrs. Miller or any other of the
PR. dog/set say about the great advantages
there are in attending the PR. shows. I
hope you go!

It seems about time that I tell you what a plea-

a good magazine—PD is vital and has somehow
preserved its integrity through the years. Perhaps
this is a peculiar choice of adjective but I find it
is a “healthy" publication that meets one of the

est pressing needs of the iancY . . . (Our thanks

JUSTICE FORTAS TO RECEIVE SCHWEITZER MEDAL
Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas will be awarded the Albert Schweitzer

Medal of the.Animal Welfare Institute, November 20, 1965, in washington, D. C.

Justice Fortes, a long-time adviser of the Institute and the Society for.Animal

Protective Legislation, whose founding he organized, took a major part in the

work to obtain enactment of the Federal Humane Slaughter Act in 1958. He wrote

the bill to require humane treatment of experimental animals which is now pend-

ing in the U. S. Senate under the sponsorship of Senators Joseph S. Clark (D., Pa.),
3. L. Bartlett (D., Alaska), Harry F. Byrd (D., Va.), Edmund Muskie (D., Maine),

and Stephen Young (3., Ohio), S. 1071, and in the U. S. House of Representatives
under the sponsorship of Rep. James C. Cleveland (R., N. H.), H.R. 5647. Until

his recent appointment to the Supreme Court made it necessary for him to give up
the private practice of law, he gave constant assistance to the effort to prevent
infliction of needless suffering on experimental animals.

Br. Schweitzer was personally interested in the bill which Justice Fortas
wrote and said of it: ”If you pass such a law in the United States, it will have
important meaning for the world. The law will then gain recognition in other
nations, too.”5

The Schweitzer Medal was first presented to Dr. Schweitzer himself in Oslo
when he received the Nobel Prize for Peace. Recipients of the Medal include Vice-
President Humphrey in 1958 and Rachel Carson in 1962. Adlai Stevenson, speaking
at the AWI Annual Meeting in 1961, the year the Medal was awarded to Isobel Slater
and Chief Fundikira of the Tanganyika SPCA, said of Dr- Schweitzer: "So fascinated
did I become with his concept of Reverence for Life that I pursued his thinking
'more fully through his writings. One paragraph summed up for me the essence of
his views. It read: 'Thought cannot avoid the ethic of reverence and love for
all life. It will abandon the old confined system of ethics and be forced to
recognize the ethics that knows no bounds. But on the other hand, those who
believe in love for all creation must realize clearly the difficulties involved
in the problem of a boundless ethic, and must be resolved not to veil from man
the conflicts in which this ethic will involve him but allow him really to expe-
rience them. To think out in every implication the ethic of love for all creation--

this is the difficult task which confronts our age.'"
