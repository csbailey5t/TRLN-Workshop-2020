Honorable wyche Fowler
Honorable Pat Swindall
Congressman from Georgia
Washington, DC

Dear Gentlemen:

It is encouraging to learn that Congress has finally decided to
do something to stop the pollution of our oceans with.plastics.

I urge your support, Sam and wyche, of S. 559, the Plastic Waste
Reduction and Disposal Act, introduced by Senator John Chaffee,
and S. 633, the Plastic Pollution Control Act, introduced by
Senator Frank Lautenberg. I do not know the details of either
Act, but we certainly need to stop the pollution of our seas
which has been going on for so many years unchecked.

I don't suppose we will ever really know how much marine life
has been thoughtlessly destroyed by the pollution of our seas.

Pat, I hope you will support H.R. 940, sponsored by Representa-
tive Gerry Studds, the Plastic Pollution Research and Control
Act.

These Acts are long, long overdue, and I hope they will be passed
and implemented immediately.

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough

Refuge biologist AI Schriver said it was a
couple of days before the shy wolves ven-
tured any distance from their pens. In their
first week or so, they did not range more
than three miles from the release point, he
reported.

“But they are doing fine,” Schriver said,
“and we’re sure excited about getting
some of them back in the wild.”

Three more pairs of red wolves are at the
refuge and will be released as soon as spe-
cially developed electronic collars are
ready for them, Schriver said.

The collars on the freed wolves, devel—
oped by the 3M company and CompuCap
Inc., not only permit biologists to track the
animals’ movements. They also contain a
remotely operated tranquilizer syringe by
which the wolves can be recaptured if
something goes wrong.

Schriver, after some genealogical re-
search, said the released male and female
were, respectively, second- and third—gen-

;Wil»t ife group defends ‘ N -
return of wolves to park '

By The Associated Press

. Wyoming’s congressional delega-
tion is being accused by conserva-
tionists of “crying wolf” over a
program designed to return the
Rocky Mountain Gray Wolf to Yel-
lowstone National Park.

The program drafted by the US. .

Fish and Wildlife Service calls for
‘10 breeding. pairs of wolves to be
returned to Yellowstone in an at-
tempt to re-establish a prey-preda-
tor balance in the park as well as
to return the “missing link” to Yel-
lowstone’s ecosystem. ,

But Sens. Malcolm Wallop and
Alan Simpson and Rep. Dick Che-
ney don’t believe the Fish and
Wildlife Service can keep the
wolves within Yellowstone and
have succeeded in sidetracking the
plan, primarily on that belief.

“My concern is not having
wolves in Yellowstone,” says Che-
ney, “but over our inability to con-
trol the predation on livestock by
wolves outside the par .”

Turn—of—the—century eradication
programs by state and federal,
hunters wiped out the wolf in the
northern Rocky Mountains, as
bounty hunters killed some 81,000
between 1883 and 1918.

Today wolves are naturally re-
establishing themselves in Glacier
National Park in northern Mon-
tana, but doubts that they will mi-
grate south to Yellowstone prompt-
. ed a Fish and Wildlife Service
' team to recommend an artificial
reintroduction plan for the park.

Yellowstone’s potential wolf
range runs from the park’s 2.2 mil—
lion acres to another 4 million
acres in surrounding forests and

..........--...— ..--

wilderness areas. Its projected
wolf population would run from 80
to 120 animals.

Proponents of the plan have cit-
ed low livestock predation rates in

Minnesota, where wolf range cov- '

ers 20 million acres and contains
roughly 1,200 wolves and about
“12,000 livestock operations in the
range containing some 234,000 head
of cattle and 91,000 sheep.
Minnesota’s annual livestock
loss amounts to about five head of
cattle per 10,000 and about 12 sheep

per 10,000, according to David .

Mech, a wildlife biologist. .
Although Bart O’Gara led the

team that drafted the Yellowstone

plan, he is not sure wolves could be

successfully returned there be-

cause during the predator’s ab-
sence the park’s elk, moose and bi- ‘
son herds have ballooned.

“When wolves are denning, they
need some small prey,” the wild-
life biologist explained. “They
(small prey) aren’t in Yellowstone.
We’ve had elk for so long there

. isn’t much else there.”

Meeteetse rancher Jack Turnell

visited Minnesota last spring to see ‘

the interaction between ranchers
and wolves, and at first came
away fairly satisfied that wolves
and ' Yellowstone-area ranchers
could co-exist. He since has
changed his opinion. _
“When I got home I though
maybe if they just kept them in
Yellowstone and everything else A
that got out was killed, I could .2
probably live with that,” he said.
“(Now), I’d just rather not see
them in Wyoming at all.” 353- i

ALEUTIAN EAGLE - September _10, 1987

Decreased Caribou Population
Causes Closure to Hunting

The caribou hunting season for the
Southern Alaska Peninsula herd in Game
Management Unit 9(1)) and Unimak
Island has been closed by emergency
order issued by the Alaska Department of
Fish and Game effective midnight,
August 31, 1987.

Richard Sellers, Area Game Biologist
- for the Alaska Peninsula, said the
complete closure was necessary because
the herd, which ranges from Port Moller
south to Cold Bay and Unimak Island,
has continued to decline, despite a major
reduction in harvest last season.

A census in late June resulted in a
count of 4,100, confirming the count of
4,543 caribou obtained last October and
indicating even fewer caribou are present
now.

The decline of this herd, from a peak
of over 10,200. in 1983, is still not
totally explained. However, Sellers said,
the recent census results from both the
Northern and Southern herds, aided by
tracking caribou ﬁtted with radio collars,
showed there has not been a mass
emigration by the Southern herd. Sellers
explained that this decline is "basically a
case where mortality has exceeded
production." The biologist noted that
even during the early 1980's when the
herd was growing, production was much
lower than for most other caribou herds
in the state. During the period when the
herd exceeded the management objective
of 5,000-6,000 caribou, there was
concern that over grazing might be
contributing to low production. Accord-
ing to Sellers, " As late as 1984 we were
worried about having too many caribou,
- not too few."

Sellers explains that "We have two

major problems in managing this herd.
Until this spring we did not have
radio-collared caribou available to follow
herd movements or to provide an
efﬁcient means of conducting a summer
census. Secondly, we have had
unreliable harvest data on the herd.
Neither were crucial during the period of
herd growth, but now have become
critical factors. For instance, last year
we reduced the bag limit from four to
one caribou by emergency regulation.
The reported harvest was only 56
caribou, down from an average of 366
per year for the previous five years. Of
the 56 caribou, only 17 were reported
harvested from all the villages which
regularly use this herd. We don't know
what the actual subsistence harvest has
been, but a recently published study of
one village suggests that those residents
may have taken as many as 500 caribou
in 1984. If this rate of harvest was valid
for other villages in 1984 and 1985, the
total harvest could have been three times
higher than was reported. For a number
of reasons, reported caribou harvest data
are generally unreliable throughout the
state, except for permit hunts."

Another concern for managers is to
identify the causes of natural mortality.
Since being collared in April, four out of

20 caribou have died. These animals .

were in poorer physical condition than
caribou from the Northern herd captured
at the same time. A late spring on the
southern tip of the Peninsula may have
contributed to nutritional stress.

Dan Timm, Regional Supervisor for .

l

the Game Division in Anchorage, says .

(Continued on Page 10)

the herd could begin its recovery...." ».

A .

"The decision to close the season this

fall was not made lightly. We realize
how important this resource is to local
residents and other hunters. Also,
several guides in the area have clients
booked for fall hunts. Closure will
cause hardship for everyone. However,
given the results of our recent census and
the extremely weak productivity this
year, there is no harvestable surplus of
caribou available to hunters. The US.
Fish and Wildlife Service in Cold Bay
has been working with us closely to
monitor this herd. Their biologists will
be conducting another intensive survey
this fall. Although we expect the survey
to further substantiate the deline, if many
additional animals 'are found, the
Department ma reOpen the season."

He added, "Any human harvest will
hasten the decline of this herd. Using
conservative estimates of natural
mortality, we would expect the herd to
number only 3,600 caribou prior to next
year's calving season. If the caribou

' produce as many calves as this year, the

herd will barely maintain itself.
Optimistically, a favorable spring in
1988 may result in a better calf crop and

deer population is at its peak. The arch-
ery season — the first phase of the
hunting season -- started Friday in
New Jersey, Sunday in northern New
York and will begin tomorrow in Con"
necticut. All three states have several
different seasons, depending on the
location and the weapon used.

Starting this year, Connecticut will
require that hunters who kill their limit
of two deer include at least one that
lacks antlers. Such deer, experts say,
are likely to be female. and killing fe-
males helps curb the population.

ln New York; wildlife officials have
raised the number of available hunting

" permits from 270,000 to 400,000. They
also hope to increased the number of
deer a hunter can kill with a deer man-'
agement permit to three from two, and

. they hope the Legislature will open
more public lands to hunting. '

“We’re dealing with a prolific ani-.
mal,” Mr. Dickinson said. “You don’t
want to turn your back on it.”

Last year, 178,713 deer were legally

' killed in New York. This year, officials

hope to see that figure increase to

about 230,000. In New Jersey, 33,771

were killed last year, and officials ex-

pect a harvest of about 35,000 this year."
In Comiecticut,‘ 5,394 deer were killed

”last year. Officials would like to see

7,000 killed this year. “We’d probably

be better with fewer deer in the state,”

said James V. Spignesi, a deer biologist
with the Department of Environmental

Protection. .

‘We’re Scratching Our Heads’

“In certain areas, it’s a very signifi-
cant problem, especially in Fairfield
County,” Mr. Spignesi said.

Mr. Dickinson cited lower than pro-

, jected hunting harvests as one reason
for the growing deer population. He
said this might be attributed to a de-- ,
clining interest in the sport or a decline ‘
in skill. “We’re scratching our heads
over that one,” he said. .

Not everyone, however, is convinced
that deer are overrunning parts of New

’ York and Connecticut. . .

Snake Ayes

As an ex-smuggler and ex-keeper of rep-
tiles and amphibians and 'as an amateur her-i
petologist, I can tell you from experience
that there are two very good reasons for en-
forcing the Lacey Act and other animal pro— "
tection legislation mentioned in “Large
Scale Obsession” [August 30]. The ﬁrst rea- 5
son is the incredible mortality rate of cap- '
tives both in the collector’s home and the
dealers’ shops and during capture and tran- 7
sit. The mortality rate in captivity is about
100 percent. Most reptiles won’t eat (like
author Greenwald’s snake) in captivity. The
second reason is the fact that keeping ani-
mals in little cages is cruel. Most reptile
freaks are OK people—interesting, differ-
ent. But their disregard for life can be as-
tounding at times. It’s a shame Greenwald
didn’t discuss this aspect of the reptile ques-
tion in his informative but rather lukewarm
article.

As Deer Increase, Their Charm Fades

By NICK RAVO

The deer population in much of the metro-
politan region has reached its highest level
in centuries, posing serious, as well as occa-
sionally comical, problems for motorists,
farmers and suburban homeowners.

Two months ago, for example, a white-
tailed deer hit by a car stopped traffic in
downtown Stamford, Conn. Two weeks ago,
a deer collided with a police car in New Ro-
chelle, N.Y., 13 miles from Times Square.

“I understand that because of some con-
struction going on~ north of here, they are
migrating down,” said Capt. Louis M.
Zummo of the New Rochelle police. “Unfor-
tunately, they are migrating in the wrong di-
rection.”

‘Road Kills’ Increase

- The reasons for the increase include not
only the return to forest of fallow farmland
and the growth of young trees with branches
low enough for feeding, but also the clearing
of land for new development.

When land is cleared for housing, for ex-
ample, deer can browse on the twigs and
leaves of felled trees. And that suburban
habitat becomes off limits to hunters.

“We’re going back to the days before the

Revolution,” said Nathaniel R. Dickinson, a
wildlife official with the New York State De-
partment of Environmental Conservation.
“That’s why you have more turkeys.
Coyotes are all over, and we’re going to
have bear moving in.

“People are always saying, ‘Where has all
the wildlife gone?’ But you don’t have any
trouble finding wildlife today.”

matic’increase in the number of road kills —- ,

rose to 8,624 last year from 7,615 in 1985. In
Connecticut, the 2,423 road kills last year
were 46 percent more than in 1985 and more
than double the number in 1981. "

But officials also report a growing num-

ber of complaints from farmers finding
deer browsing in their orchards, alfalfa
fields and nursery stock. And just as an-‘
noyed are homeowners in areas like West-
chester County, N.Y., and F airfield County,
Conn., who find deer stripping their shrubs.

“People say isn’t it wonderful, having
deer in their backyards,” said Mr. Dickin—
son. “But after a while, after the deer start
browsing, they start looking at them like
rats. Their attitude really changes.”

Little Change in Jersey

In New York, the deer population has
grown to an estimated 750000 from about
450,000 10 years ago, In Connecticut, it grew
to about 30,000 from 19,000 over the same
period.

New Jersey officials said their deer popu—
lation has held relatively steady at 150,000
for the last 10 years. They said an increase
in road kills to about 6,000 last year from
5,000 the year before was due primarily to a
better reporting system.

Precise statistics are unavailable, but of-
ficials said many of the New York road kills
were in the Catskills and in Dutchess and

THE DENVER POST — September 27, 1987

Handgun expert eagerly awaits elk season

By Charlie Meyers
Denver Post Outdoor Writer

When the Colorado elk season
Opens Oct. 10, Bob Good hepes
literally to beat everyone to the
draw. He’s done it before.

This will be the first year that
elk, as well as antelope, may be
legally taken with a handgun

. and Good hopes to be near the
head of the line to get one with a

method that perhaps is the fast-.

est growing arm of shooting
sports. When handguns first
were legalized for deer and bear
in 1978, Good bagged a 30-inch
buck just after daybreak that
perhaps was the first taken in
the state. ' .
Setting hunting standards is
nothing new for the Northglenn
resident, who, in 1984, was the
first inductee into the National

,_

Handgun Hunting Hall of Fame.
Using a variety of specialized
weapons, he has bagged every-
thing from antelope to ele-
phants. His only question about
elk is why Colorado waited so

long to follow the lead of other

states in legalizing this larger
me.

“There was a time when the
capability of the shooter ex—
ceeded that of the cartridge in
terms of accuracy and trajecto-
ry, but that changed some time
ago,” Good said. “Now hand-
guns will outshoot most rifles at
100 yar .”

When he goes out for elk,»

Good will be shooting a .454 Ca-
sull, a highly sophisticated fire-
arm with twice the energy of a
.44 magnum. He already .has
taken two six-point bulls in Mon-

tana using a .375 J DJ , one of the
most popular handguns among
the more than one million hunt-
ers nationwide who have adopt-
ed the sport.

Good believes it there is a
problem with handgun hunting,
it is its image with those who do
not understand it. . .

“Some people imagine a
bunch of guys running around
with six—guns on their hips blaz-
ing away. In reality, people who
hunt with handguns tend to be
very serious about it and exceed
the capability of the average ri-
fle hunter,” says Good, whose
“The Classic Book of Handgun
Hunting” will be published in
January. ~ . -

But to do so, he must invest
more time in practice to devel-
op the special shooting skills

and employ more discipline -in '1

“I wound up with lots of cac-
tus in my elbows and knees;
hunting antelope in Wyoming
last year, but I got my buck. I -
also saw a lot of rifle hunters .;
blazing away at long range into i
herds of running antelope,” said
Good, who also has hunted with I
a riﬂe most of his life. ‘:

“I don’t know many handgun
hunters who would do that.”

GREAT FALLS, MONTANA TRIBUNE - September 11, 1987

By BERT LINDLER
Tribune Staff Writer

MISSOULA —- A conservation or-
ganization that supports reintroduc-
tion of wolves in the northern Rock-
ies has raised $3,149 to compensate
three Browning-area ranchers for“
livestock killed by wolves earlier
this summer.

“We don’t think it’s reasonable to
expect livestock producers to bear
the economic burden of wolf rec-
overy,” said Hank Fischer, Mis-
soula, a field“ representative for De-
fenders of Wildlife, a national con-
servation organization. “That’s what
leads to hatred of the animal, which
in' turn leads to illegal killings.”

Compensation is not intended to
replace a control program.

“We recognize the necessity of
controlling wolves that repeatedly

prey on livestock,” Fischer said.

“Our objectiVe behind the com-

burden of wolf recovery from the
individual livestock producer to
those people who support having

Dan Geer, who ranches 17 miles
northwest of Browning, lost three
yearling cattle, nine ewes and a
lamb to wolves. He also cannot ac-
count for two other cattle.

“I Certainly appreciate the effort
to pay for the livestock lost,” Geer
said. However, he doesn’t want the
public to have the impression it’s all
right to have wolves because ran-
chers are being paid for all their
losses. Defenders is paying only for
livestock that were found by ran-
chers and verified as wolf kills by
federal Animal Damage Control
agents.

“In this particular area I can’t

believe that we would probably ever
get to a point where we would find
and validate more than 10 percent of
the wolf kills,” Geer said. Brush and
trees could conceal carcasses.

“If I spent every daylight hour of

ground I would have to check look-
ing for wolf kills, let alone do any of
the other work,” he said. “There’s
too many acres and too few people.

have left for the winter, I better be

WASHINGTON POST - October 4, 1987 '

Farm Animals Seized in DC. Basement.
' 'Goat, Cow, Pig, Fowl Reportedly Kept in Inhumane Conditions

 

By Douglas Stevenson
Washington Post Staff Writer

 

Farm animals including a cow, a
, goat and a pig and more than 20
fowl were confiscated by local hu-
mane society officers after they
were found tethered and boxed in
an unlighted basement in North-
west Washington yesterday after-
noon.

Officers Of the Washington Hu-
mane Society were called to 1460
Park Rd. after neighbor's com-

plained to poliCe that the animals
‘1 were being kept in inhumane con-
.ditions. The animals were taken to
. the DC. Animal Shelter until their
owner, who said he was Francisco
’7 Rigore of the Park Road address,

can provide suitable shelter, said
Jean Goldenberg, executive direc-
tor of the humane society. '

“These animals were acquired for
some religious ritual and they were
to be killed and the community was

to be fed with them,” Goldenberg .

said.

Rigore, who says he was a polit-
ical prisoner for 15 years in Cuba
before coming to the United States
in 1980, said through an interpreter
that he bought the animals so he
could “celebrate the day [I] arrived
[in the United States], [my] birth-
day and [my] religion.” He said he
will turn 48 today. '

The animals and the fowl were
purchased Thursday at a Thur-
mont, Md., farm, Rigore said, and

he said he had planned to slaughter
them yesterday evening.

A Woman who identified herself
as Maria Rigore, a friend who
sometimes lives at the house, said
that after the slaughter, Francisco
Rigore was going “to cook [the an:
imals} for the poor people.”

Goldenberg said the humane so-
ciety had no complaint with Ri-
gore’s plans to slaughter the ani-
mals for food but had to act because
“it’s the manner in which it’s done.”
She characterized the treatment of

the animals as cruel. “These ani-

mals had their legs tied, they were

on their ‘sides and they couldn’t
, move. The pig was shoved into a

crate sideways and was unable to
make any movement at all.”

itAnﬂn, Conroy Operates Wildlife Revival ‘

By RONALD POREP
For GRIT .
, In today’s world, wild animals lead
hazardous lives. They’re hit by cars,
pulled from their nests, shot at and even
trapped. Some of them die.

In Chicago’s suburbs, many others
liVe with the help of Ann Conroy.

In a four-acre backyard, - known as
Wildlife Revival, Inc., in Long Grove,
111., Conroy cares for 150 to 200 animals
at one time. ~ ‘ -

Frequently, the animals are brought
to Conroy by the community service
ofﬁcers of Chicago area police depart-
ments or private citizens. Most often,
she gets a call in the wee hours of the
morning to pick up an injured creature.

“You’d not think that this turkey
would be scared of anything. He made
his nest on the front lawn of a house,”
chuckles Conroy as she tries to sooth the
bird who’s larger than a 25-inch televi-
sion set. Conroy doesn’t have much time
for the turkey because she’s trying to
prepare breakfast for her charges
before the phone rings again. Not only
does she pick up injured birds and ani-
mals, in many instances, she nurses
them back to health and returns them to
- their natural environment.

“I work from-4 am. to 8 pm. every;

day,” she says. “I get an average Of 30

calls each day,” she says. “Most of the
animals who come here are in and out,
but there are the special ones,” she
sighs as she stops by the cage of a rac-
coon. '

“Come here, baby,” Conroy says as
she taps the animal’s cage. ’

Hearing the sounds, the raccoon lifts
his head, seeming to perk up. He will
never return to his natural environ-

ment, Conroy points out, because he’s ‘
blind due to the 30 ticks which must be

removed from his eyes.

“When needed, I take an animal to the
veterinarian but mostly these animals
just need a warm body to help mend
their wounds,” she says, adding, “I took
in over 600 animals last year.

CONROY’S work has its fun
moments as well as seriOus ones.

“A while ago, I was working in the

yard and looked up,t0 ﬁnd a huge black

.cloud hovering overhead,” she says.

“No, it wasn’t a tornado. Four peacocks
and two turkeys had gotten out Of their
cage and were making a very clumsy
test ﬂight. That was panic time. Eventu-
ally, they realized it was dinner time
and returned to me,” laughs Conroy as
she quickly tr‘udges through heavy

leaves which help make her wild animal.

inﬁrmary'look like ‘a‘ jungle. ' ‘

A line of Canadian geese marches by.
her followed by an African goose who. .
seemingly, also thinks he’s Of Canadiarg-f
origin.

“Most of the geese are here because:
they were shot and survived. If they;
hadn’t come here, where would they;
have gone?” Conroy asks she hurries
away to care for yet another injured]
creature.

 




ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - October 10, 1987

Aldermanic Bills Target
Pit Bulls And Loitering

By Tim O’Neil
" Of the Post-Dispatch Staff
St. Louis would regulate pit bull
terriers and give police officers re-
, newed powers to deal With loitering
under three bills introduced Friday
to the Board of Aldermen.
1 Committee hearings are expected
—. within the next two weeks.
Many cities throughout the nation,
, including Fenton, Mo., and Washing-
ton Park, 111., have passed this year
' ordinances banning or regulating pit
bulls. The dogs have been the subject
of numerous recent news reports
about attacks on people and other
animals.

The bill would not ban ownership

* of the dogs but would require owners
‘ to register them with the city, to buy
fliability insurance and to keep the
dogs confined or under direct control.
The two bills on loitering would
give police officers the power to
make arrests for loitering or unlawful
‘ assembly in public places if a police
order to leave or disperse was ig-
nored. Aldermanic sponsors said fed-
eral courts had ruled unconstitutional
the old loitering laws that cities had
‘ used for decades.
Alderman David Kinealy, D-14th
Ward, the prime sponsor of all three

bills, says he wants to regulate pit
bulls “to protect the people who live
near those dogs.”

Alderman Mary Ross, D—5th Ward
and a co-sponsor, said that many
ownerszof pit bulls “seem to have a
sadistic pleasure in owning some-
thing that is dangerous.”

Members of the St. Louis Bull Ter-
rier Club said that they would ask the
city to pass an ordinance against “all

vicious dogs” rather than single out

pit bulls. Pit bulls are a type of bull
terrier. .

Don Hamby of Columbia, 111., a
club member, noted that Spuds Mac-
kenzie, a dog used in Bud Light beer
advertisements, “is what some people
would call a pit bull.” The dog used
in Bud Light commercials is an Eng-
lish bull terrier.

A spokesman for Anheuser-Busch
Cos. Inc., which brews Bud Light,
said, “We are confident that the
board does not intend to ban Mr. (sic)
Mackenzie from his headquarters
city.” . .

The bill would require owners of
bull terriers, American and Stafford-
shire bull terriers, and mixed breeds
with the “appearance and character-
istics” of those types of dogs to regist-
er the animals with the city. Owners

In June, a federal grand jury‘in —

“The insurance value on (the

Los Angeles

A fishermen’s group failed

to halt the transfer of sea otters
into prime fishing territory off
the California coast when a fed-
eral judge refused yesterday to
issue an injunction blocking it.

The coalition of commercial

j and sport fishermen had asked for ,

the court order, claiming the reloca- .
tion plan would harm the .otters,
deplete valuable shellfish in the ar-
ea and create a competitive envi-
ronment with fur seals already liv-

Fortyseven otters have been
moved to waters off Southern Cali~
fornia’s San Nicholas Island, with
continued capture and relocation
efforts scheduled to begin this
week, US. Fish and Wildlife spokes-
WOman Diane Hoobler said.

“Weather permitting, our di-
vers will resume the capture of. ot-
ters from Central California waters
sometime this week,” Hoobler said.
“The program took a break to get
our divers rested and all of their
gear repaired.” ‘ .

The plan calls, for the removal ,
of 70 otters to create a new breeding .

colony off the island, which is 100

During the energy boom of

the early 1980s, registered quarter

horses were the Rolls-Royce of the

Southwest and the subject of a,

speculation fever that drove the
price of good or even average
horseflesh into the tens of thou-

broke, some speculators decided
their investments were worth more
dead than alive. -

"A lot of people got into the
business because they thought it
would be a fast return, and when
the bottom dropped out, they ended
up losing everything they owned
and then some. And what did they
do? They put a lot of insurance on

them (the animals), and they killed -

them,” said William Graham, 45, a

Seven people were convicted of.
mail fraud, conspiracy and other
federal charges in Arkansas in 1986
in a scheme'in which 19 horses
were killed and claims of $897,250
were made against ﬁve insurance
companies. .

Cecil Jines, a quarter-horse
trainer from Black Rock, Ark.,
testified he created the scheme
because he “saw how easy it was”
to make money through insurance
fraud. Jines, who pleaded guilty, is
serving a 7-year prison term.

Jines said he would buy a horse,
then transfer it to an accomplice,
who would prepare a bill of sale to
another accomplice inflating the
value of the animal. Little money
ever changed hands.

A policy would be taken but at
the inflated value, usually naming
the accomplices rather than Jines
as “the beneficiary. Soon, the ani-
mals would die from what appeared
to be natural or accidental causes,

" and the schemers would divvy up

the insurance money. .
Assistant U.S. Attorney Brent
Bumpers said the scheme "is with.
out a doubt the most gruesome and
grotesque offense I’d ever prose-
cut ." .
, Doc’s Chrome Cat, which was
insured for $125,000, was electro-
cuted. Jines testified that Dr.
Thomas Watson, a Warm Springs,

three years in prison, cut away

problems at the autopsy.

Exotic Pet Rental Draws Crowds

Lenny The Squirrel Monkey

By VALERIE BUTLER

Piccadilly Pet Shop, a College
Park store that specializes in ex-
otic beasts, is giving a whole new
meaning to the term animal mag-
netism.

With a service that leases
trained pets for parties, weddings
and conventions for $75, the shop
has proven the drawing power of
animals.

A whole menagerie is available,
from Herschel the squirrel monkey
to Chuckles the parrot and String-
bean the military macaw.

For an extra fee, the shop will.
throw in a trainer (in costume, if
you wish) to feed and handle the
animal of your choice.

Puff the magic iguana, a resi-
dent a Piccadilly’s Ansley Mall
store, can be brought to South"
Fulton upon request. Doves and
cockatiels also are available, ac-
cording to David Anderson of Pic;
cadilly in College Park.

Anderson says Piccadilly Exotics
has been popular since the day the
rental service opened in 1985.

“People have been going crazy
with renting animals,” he said. “I
don’t know why; I guess it’s just
because it’s something different.”

Shop worker Bill Mertz, who
sometimes acts as a trainer, said
the animals bring life to just about
any gathering.

“As soon as people see that the
animals are tame, they just ﬂock
to them.” He has been working at
the pet shop for six months. Dur-
ing that time, he has taken ani-
mals to a party for newlyweds and
an. exhibit at the Convention and
Trade Center.

“We tend to attract more people
than other booths at trade shows,”
he said. “The birds really love the
attention.”

TAMPA TRIBUNE

The wait isn’t as long at game

By FRANK SARGEANT
Tribune Outdoors Editor

Johnston Ayala got started right in deer hunt-
ing a few weeks back when he visited Carter’s
Pasture near Lake City. The 13-year-old, who had
yet to take his first venison, kayoed two trophy-
class fallow bucks at the 12,000-acre ranch.

Johnston’s dad, Tampa attorney DeHart Ay-
ala Jr., said the game ranch concept is a good
one for getting young people started in hunting.

“Hunting whitetails takes tremendous pa-
,tience and the belief that if you wait long
enough, you’ll eventually see a deer,” Ayala said.
“But for youngsters, the wait is often too darn
long - they get turned off because it takes days
for anything to happen. That’s not the case at 3

over feeding areas, and any hunter who sits
there and keeps quiet will get a shot in a fairly
short period of time,” Ayala said.

Mike Carter, who now operates the ranch
where both his father and grandfather ran cattle
and cut timber, says that his operation is good
for older hunters as well, and for sportsmen who
don’t have enough time to spend a week in the
woods looking for a native whitetail.

“We know where our game feeds and we _
keep the populations up through constant re-

' stocking, so that it’s no problem for a business-

man to come up here on a Friday night, have a
good, country-style dinner in the lodge, get out on
the stand at daylight next morning, and have his
deer skinned and cut up by noon. He can be back
in Tampa that night if he wants to.”

game ranch.”

Ayala, who bought the hunt at the FCA auc-
tion last spring, said that the large number of
animals at Carter’s made it far easier to find a
harvestable buck than it is to locate a whitetail in
Limost areas.

“Their operation has good, enclosed blinds

The season on “exotics” -— non-native game
-- is open year around. Carter said that in addi-
tion to the fallow and axis deer -- both of which ,
have better tasting venison than native whitetails
— he has auodad and mouflon sheep, sika deer,
black buck and even buffalo and elk. He can also
make special arrangements to hunt whitetails, .

turkeys and black bear during the regular state
seasons -— all three species are natives that
roam in and out of the ranch at will. ’

Columbia County, where the ranch is located,
is one of only three counties in the state where
bears can be harvested.

Carter buys most of the animals he stocks
from Texas game ranches, though he raises a
fair number on his own.

“There’ s no doubt that our hunting is not as
challenging as going into a wildlife management
area and trying to find a whitetail,” Carter notes.
“but you’re still dealing with wild animals here
and because they are hunted, they learn to be
wary. It’s a good place to learn the basics of
hunting for a beginner —— you still have to stay
concealed, you can’t move around a lot, and you
can’t be waving the gun out the window of the
blind.”

Hunt fees, including lodging, guide, and tro-
phy care are $150 per day. Trophy fees vary
from $150 for a turkey to $1,000 for a trophy axis
deer. Brochures are available from Carter’s Pas-
ture, 100 W. Madison, Lake City, FL 32055; (904)

DENVER POST - September 28, 1987

By Gary Schmitz
Denver Post Washington Bureau

WASHINGTON -— Want a fight on the West-
ern range? Just talk about raising a rancher’s
grazing fees. You might as well steal his
horse.

In 1985, the reaction to proposals to hike the
levy for running cows on 300 million acres of
federal range was so furious that Congress
could not agree on any one plan, and the law
simply expired.

Ever since, the grazing programs of the
US. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land
Management have been operated under an ex-
ecutive order by President Reagan. But the
fees it provides — a sliding scale with a mini—
mum of $1.35 per animal per month — don’t
meet the costs of operating the grazing pro-
gram.

The government, in turn, has spent as much
as $40 million annually to subsidize the 23,000
Western cattle and Sheep operations that de-
pend on federal turf to supplement their pri-
vate land holdings.

Now, Congress appears ready to step in,
and the uproar has begun anew.

Conservationists and fiscal critics are push-
ing two measures that would significantly hike
grazing rates. One is sponsored by Georgia
Democratic Rep. Buddy Darden, the other by
Oklahoma Democratic Rep. Mike Synar,
chairman of the House Government Opera-
tions Subcommittee on Natural Resources.

Both proscribe similar fee formulas, rough-
ly tripling present rates. The Synar version
additionally would direct part of the new reve-
nue to improve and protect rangeland water-
shed. ~

The legislative threat has roused cattlemen
from their complacency. ,

In response, farm groups and other Western
interests are urging that the fee structure in
the president’s order -— which ties fees to in-
flation and the price of beef — be made per-
manent. Legislation to “do just that has been
introduced by Republican Reps. Ron Marle-
nee of Montana and Dick Cheney of Wyoming,
a state that leads the nation in the number of
livestock feeding on federal range.

Last week, all three bills were reviewed
during a marathon, 9—hour hearing by the
House Interior Subcommittee on Public
Lands. “This is a highly emotional and impor-
tant issue,” observed'Wyoming’s Cheney, as
be surveyed the standing-room—only crowd be-
fore him. .

, Reflecting the sensitivity of the issue, Colo-

rado Agriculture Commissioner Peter Decker

testified to the plight of many Colorado ranch-
3.4: - . , . as .

ers, but also stressed sound conservation poli-
cies and “fair costs.” The state’s top farm of-

ficial carefully avoided endorsing any of the

three legislative proposals.
“The fee schedule you set can, indeed will,

either sustain or destroy this industry,” Deck?

er told the subcommittee.
According to a Forest Service assessment
made public at the hearing, the Marlenee-Che-

ney bill’s abandonment of the current $1.35

minimum could cut current fees by nearly a
third, to 98 cents per animal, per month.

Comparable rights on private range land,go
for $4 to $8, protested Synar, repeating his de-
mand that fees be pegged to fair market val-
ue.
“Who pays the difference (between fees
and government costs)? Taxpayers,” Synar
said.

Cheney countered that the budgetary cri-
tique of the grazing program merely disguised
a “hidden agenda,” which be characterized
as, “making life so difficult it won’t be possi-
ble for ranchers to continue (in business).”

Conservation groups insist they are moti- .
_ vated by environmental and wildlife concerns.

“Much of today’s abuse of public lands is a
direct result of federal grazing fees that are
far below fair market value,” charged Steve
Johnson, a Tucson-based representative for
the national environmental group, Defenders
of Wildlife.

Grazing policies have contributed to the
“decimation of hundreds of species of wild-
life,” and have been a factor in the declining
populations of grizzly bear, wolf and the
black-footed ferret, Johnson said.

Proponents of reform also note that low
fees, together with permits that are easily
transferred from one owner to another, have
made federal range allocations a valuable
commodity in many Western counties.

It is common practice for ranchers to back
up their loans with federal grazing permits,
and some permit holders offer their federal
grazing rights to other ranchers at a profit.

”For all these reasons, grazing rights to fed-
eral property can greatly enhance the value of
private cattle ranches. “The real estate value
of many Western ranches is more dependent
on the amount of federal land under permit
than the value of the private land,” Johnson
said. - .

Besides recalculating charges for livestock
use of federal lands, the Synar and Darden
measures would address these aspects of the
grazing program by putting restrictions on
range permits. :

Not surprisingly, however, the biggest bat-

.3

 

 

‘The fee schedule you set can,
indeed will, either sustain or

' destroy this industry.’

Colorado Agriculture Commissione:
Peter Decker told the subcommittei

tle is over fees. An Interior Department re
port estimated that increasing grazing fee ti
$3 per animal per month would reduce incomi

, in Western states by $35 million, and eliminati ,

1,100 jobs.

Those findings are disputed by Synar am
Darden, who point to the grazing permits hek
by Union and Getty oil companies as evidence
that many permit holders can easily absorb a1
increase.

Ranchers say that characterization is un
fair.

“The vast majority are not vast corpora
tions or absentee landowners, but individua
ranchers and their families playing a key rol(
in rural communities of the West,” said Reea
Malles, a Cortez rancher and vice president 0-
the Colorado Cattlemen’s Association. - .

A 1986 study by the General Accounting Off
fice‘found that individuals held 76 percent 0%
all federal grazing permits, corporations belt
11 percent and partnerships 8 percent. ,

Constance Brooks, vice president of the
Denver-based Mountain States Legal Founda‘
tion, argued that the law not only allows the
government to consider the financial conditior
of ranchers and communities dependent or
the cattle business when it determines its
grazing fees, but obligates it to do so.

. Nolin and his sheep-hunting

Madel and the wardens at a cafe in
Choteau, on the East Front, Satur-

As Nolin waited for wildlife offi—

TAMPA TRIBUNE — September 1987

2*“ 773“. v;
m» l ' .

By RICK HULL
of Kalispell Daily Inter Lake

KALISPELL, Mont. (AP) -- “As
I looked at that canyon, I realized it
was not going to be any turkey
shoot,” said Bob Nolin, reflecting on
his hunt for a rogue grizzly bear in
Montana’s rugged Rocky Mountain
East Front.

The bear, a 400-pound sow that

was killing cattle on ranches in the

foothills, had quietly circled behind
its stalkers once in the brushy,

rocky canyon, eluding their rifles“

But then it rushed across a small
clearing. .

Nolin nailed it from over 200
yards, the first kill in Montana’s
new hunt for problem bears.

The grizzly is a threatened spe-
cies. Only a handful are ever hunt-
ed legally here, and even problem
bears that habitually threaten peo~
pie or kill livestock usually are
trapped and killed by injection.

That made Nolin’s hunt all the
more unusual. He was the first to
take part in a special Montana pro-

gram that allows hunters, chosen by .

lot, to stalk problem grizzlies that
already have been marked for elim-
ination. ‘

The hunters were selected in
April. Nolin’s was the first drawn of
the 1,389 names in the bowl. And
since April, he has awaited the call
from Montana game officials notify-
ing him his grizzly had been identi-
fied and giving him 24 hours to re-
port to the scene.

The call came on Friday, Sept.
18. Nolin was in the middle of a
bighorn sheep hunt near the Idaho
border. But he checked in at home
by telephone Friday night, just in

' case.

“I’ve been by the phone since
April, ever since I was chosen No.
l,” he said.

‘ That’s when he learned he had
to be in Choteau, '260 miles by car
across the Rocky Mountains, at 8
am. Saturday for the hunt’s start.
He made it to his Kalispell home by

midnight, and called biologist Mike

Madel, concerned about driving

some sleep, putting off the hunt un-

“Actually, I really didn’t sleep at

The target was No. 316, a 6-year
old, 400-pound grizzly sow that had
been transplanted three times.

The last time was on Sept. 9,
when she Was set loose in the Mid-
dle Fork of the Flathead River, be-

tween Glacier National Park to the
north and the Bob Marshall Wilder-

'ness complex to the south.

Ten days and 120 miles later,
the grizzly was back on the East
Front, where the Rockies rise
abruptly from the Plains, her radio
tracking collar betraying her loca-
tion to game officials.

“This 316 is a notorious bear on
the East Front,” he said. “Believe
me, I had heard a lot about her be-
fore.”

large dogs are desirable [sets

as well. I would .love nothing more than to live ’

Re "Leash proposal is sensible move,” by
Catherine Ford, Herald, Sept. 3.

I’m glad that we live in a country where we
still have the right to at, least let our voice be
heard. In the past few years, it seems that little
by little, more and more laws are being passed
which seem to be taking away a lot of the free-
doms we once had. ‘“

We’ve had the War Measures Act, the gun
control legislation, the anti-smoking bylaws ——
I’m not a smoker but do feel it somewhat unfair
—— then we had the seat-belt law and now this.

There are quite a few irresponsible dog own-
ers. I’m sure there are things that I can improve
on as a dog owner. But judging from Ford’s col-
umn, if she owns a dog it’s a small one.

Most people who own large dogs do not share
the view that large dogs are macho and small
dogs aren’t. Poodles, pekinese, Chihuahuas and
most other types of small dogs are generally
yappy and are certainly not my idea of a dog I’d
want to have for a pet. Large dogsare generally
good with kids, are lovable and easier to train,
are fantastic watch dogs and provide good pro
tection.

Most people, if it weren’t for lack of jobs,
would if given a chance, move to the country
where they could own an acreage with plenty of
space for their dogs to roam free from having to
be choked by air pollution and leashes and with-
out the threat of neighbors’ poisoning their dogs

in such a place.

I share Ford’s views wholeheartedly when it
comes to people who don’t walk their dogs and

who do leave them penned up. And she’s right

when she says that "a society which believes it’s
reasonable to leash small children in public and
allows animals to run loose, has a couple of
screws loose.”

I realize things have been unfair to those who

don’t own dogs and I’m glad people are wanting .

to crack down in some way on giving steeper
ﬁnes to owners who allow their dogs to run at
large getting into garbage and attacking people.

I believe though, that the veterinarians knew
what they were talking about too, when they
said that dogs need open spaces to run. Rather
than infringe on people’s rights even further by
banning large dogs altogether or forcing respon-
sible dog owners to leash well-behaved obedient
dogs, why don’t we get to the heart of the issue
which is that there should still be the right and
privilege for dogs to at least run freely through
fields and most playgrounds provided they are
supervised by their owners and that they don’t
defecate everywhere. Then it should be the own-
er’s responsibility to pick up after their dog.

LACEE NEU,
Calgary.

Majority of dog owners are responsible

Re "Leash proposal is sensible move,” by
Catherine Ford, Herald, Sept. 3.

Man and dog have been together since the
beginning of time.

I think Ford is the type of person who will
jump on any bandwagon that happens to'be

elderly hours of enjoyment in their less than
perfect world, and yes, they also hold down full-

As for open areas - what open areas? The ‘

take another look around. The majority of dog

Li vesfock-killin g grizzly
to be moved near Glacier

HELENA (AP) - An adult sow
grizzly bear suspected of killing
livestock along the East Front of
the Rocky Mountains was captured
last weekend and will be relocated

» along the Middle Fork of the
Flathead River southwest of
Glacier National Park, officials
said Tuesday.

Dan Vincent of Great Falls,
regional supervisor for the state
Department of Fish, Wildlife and
Parks, said that grizzly “No. 316”
had eluded trappers who used

traditional methods.

So, he said, a helicopter from
the state Livestock Department
was brought in, and FWP biologist

Michael Madel used a tranquilizer

New Arrival .
At The Chesnuts'

Neighbors on 24-hour alert
gathered with Dave and Linda
Chesnut at their Dunwoody
pasture in the early morning
hours recently to witness the
birth of Ashford Dunwoody,
the newest addition to the
Chesnut menagerie. Linda
Chesnut is pictured with the
youngster, who is the son of
Debra, who tame to the Ches-
nuts along with 45 others res-
cued during the 1985 Death
Valley burro round-up. The
Chesnuts’ pasture served as
the drop-off point from which
citizens from all over Georgia
collected their new pets. Ash-
ford’s half-brother, William
Andrew Young Jackson (his
father’s name was William

BOSTON GIDBE - September 17, 1987

Ospreys found to swap data

By Richard Saltus ,
Globe Staff

, An ecologist observing ospreys
‘ in Novia Scotia reports that the
big hawks swap astonishingly de-
tailed tips about where the fish
are. a form of information ex-
; change about the location of p07
‘ tential prey rivaling anything yet
documented in animals.

Only the dance of the honeybee
comes to mind as a more highly
evolved animal communication
concerning finding food. said
Erick Greene of Princeton Univer~
sity.

He said ospreys he observed in
1981 in a Nova Scotia salt marsh
colony could precisely identify a
captured fish being brought home
by one of their mates.

Depending on what species of
fish it was, the others knew imme-
diately whether it was worth
flying off in search of similar fish.
And, by retracing the bird's flight
; path. they could calculate which
' direction to take.

For example. the sight of a cap-

tured alewife or smelt would send
the ospreys off to the hunt. be-

cause those species travel in-

schools that can be tapped for fur‘

ther prey. But if the birds saw-

that it was a flounder that had
been caught. they would not stir:
these fish swim randomly on the
ocean floor. ‘

. “If you know where another os-
prey caught a flounder. it's not
really going to help you." Said
Greene, whose report is being pub-
lished in today's edition of the
journal Nature. So. “when an os-
prey returns to the colony with a
flounder, the other birds ignore
it."

On a few striking occasions,
the returning ospreys seemed to
be actively alerting the colony to a
good fish find by mounting a man-
ic “display." screeching and
wheeling about the sky.

”The other osprey would just
pile out of the colony and head off
in that direction," said Greene in
an interview from Nova Scotia.
But this only happened, he em-
phasized. when the hunter was
bringing back fish that traveled in
schools, never — out of 16 such dis-
plays he saw — when the catch
was a ﬂounder.

 

 

 

 

a

on where to find their food

 

 

 

Ospreys usually are solitary nesters.

Greene wrote that the study
“has demonstrated a new level of
sensitivity in the ability of a colo-
nial animal to assess the quality
of information about the location
Of potential prey."

He acknowledged that in the
insect world, the honeybee exhib-
its a far more complex communi-
cation system, in which bees re-
turning from a find of nectar per-
form a dance that signals the di-
rection and distance of the sweet
discovery.

“There also is recent work that
indicates they will regurgitate

some of the honey to convey infor-

mation to other bees about the su-
gar concentration of the nectar."
said Greene. "Bees get much more
excited if the sugar content is
high. and are more likely to go and
lock for nectar."

- Ospreys. big brown—and-white
hawks known for their ability to
spy fish deep in the water and
plummet feet-first to nab them.
usually are solitary nesters. Some-
times though, their nests cluster
in colonies that have been known
to include 300 breeding pairs.

Scientists studying animal be-

.' havior have suggested a number

of reasons for colony arrange-
ments. said Greene. and one is
that they serve as “information
centers" for exchanging tips
about good foraging locations.
The Princeton biologist spent
the summer of 1981 on a bluff
overlooking the colony. watching
the birds through a telescope. He

Globe file photo ‘

concluded that the ospreys’ infor—
mation sharing enabled them to
expend less time and energy on
gathering food. .

A tempting conclusion. said
Greene. is that the hunting net-
work meant that colony-living os—
preys produced more offspring
than those living singly. That
would suggest that evolutionary
forces favored the formation of os—
prey colonies

However. Greene said studies
to confirm that theory have not
been done. And an osprey special-
ist at the Marine Biological Labo-
ratory in Woods Hole said he disa-
grees with Greene’s suggestion.

“Most ospreys are solitary
nesters. and it doesn't make a
darn bit of difference" in the num-
ber of chicks they produce. said
Alan Poole in a telephone inter-
view. “So it's very hard to say that
natural selection is favoring the
kinds of things he‘s seeing."

Poole. who has just completed a
book on the osprey. said he be-
lieves the Nova Scotia colony is in-
deed sharing hunting informa-
tion, but that it may be an isolat-
ed phenomenon.

“I'd like to see more data on it;
I‘d like to see it happen some
where else." he said.

Whether or not it happens
widely. Poole said the study shows
that ”the birds are keying in on
this kind of information. They are
discriminating between species of
fish and basing actions on what
they see."

By MIKE MAHAN
Tribune Staff Writer

EFFNER —- A 700-pound tortoise the size of
an office desk slowly ambles by in the
shimmering heat. The surrounding lush
tropical growth adds to the unreality of the

 

situation.

A few feet away, several Isle of Pines parrots preen
and chatter. The colorful birds are remarkable to any-
one, but even more so if you happen to know that this
species has been extinct in the wild for years.

You have entered the world of Dr. Ramon Noegel
and Greg Moss. Fantasy Island, perhaps? Wrong. Try
Seffner, Fla.

Noegel, the founder and director of the Life Fellow-
ship Bird Sanctuary, and Moss, the general curator, are
practitioners of captive breeding.

Their life’s work is breeding birds and reptiles to
safeguard the animals from extinction. They are aided
by Moss’ 9-year-old sister Nikki, who knows more about
the animals than many adults.

The mammoth tortoise is called the “giant Galapa-
gos.” Efforts to breed the reptile in captivity began as
early as 1928. Some institutions waited 30 years to get
results. Only five groups have been successful in their
attempts to breed the creature in the past 59 years,
according to Moss.

Life Fellowship hatched 19 in a single year after
having the herd for only two years. Noegel and Moss
have had similar success with the “great African
spurred tortoise,” two of which they recently sent to a
200 near Cambridge, England.

The Isle of Pines Amazon parrot is bred regularly at
the facility. The vast majority of those existing in cap-
tivity are the result of breeding efforts begun at the
sanctuary.

Other rare animals bred at Life Fellowship -— some
saved from extinction —- include Cuban iguanas, Grand
Cayman blue iguanas, and St. Vincent’s parrots.

Naturalists the world over try to duplicate what
Noegel and Moss have accomplished in this rural east-
ern Hillsborough community.

The two attribute their remarkable accomplish-
ments to patience, common sense and a not-so-common
empathy and reverence for living things.

“Eleven years ago I tired of the old, worn methods
of animal husbandry,” Noegel said. “All of our ap-
proaches at that time were strictly man’s ideas as to
how it should be accomplished, with little consideration
as to what the birds wanted. Therefo
ing to the birds, took their interests into consideration.

, I began listen-n

 

 

Greg Moss, the sanctuary’ 3 general curator,
feeds an apple to a Galapagos tortoise, above.
The sanctuary hatched 19 of the rare tortoises
in one year. Moss holds a baby Diademed Am-
azon parrot, right. Empathy for the animals has
led to a high success rate in captive breeding.

 

 

The results are now a matter of record.”

The sanctuary generally breeds only species that
have been classified as seriously threatened or endan-
gered. It has garnered four First United States Breed-
ings in its 23 years, according to Dale Thompson of the
American Federation of Aviculturists, whose organiza-
tion keeps track of captive breedings.

Noegel says the sanctuary also has to its credit 13

First World Breedings.

“Ramon has an outstanding re-
cord,” said Mike Cunningha‘m, an
ornithologist and associate curator
of birds at the Los Angeles Zoo. “If
I had the type of success he does,
I’d be screaming ‘Look at me, look
at what I’ve accomplished.’ But not
Ramon; that's not his style.”

Noegel’s “style” is difficult to

describe. The 53—year-old moves

gracefully but with a definite econo-
my of motion.

He speaks softly and slowly,
. weighing his words the way some
might weigh precious minerals. He
does not like to be photographed.

Any description of the man
would be incomplete without men-
tioning that he is the founder and
director of the Life Fellowship
Church, which supplies the money,
through members’ contributions, for
the Life Fellowship Bird Sanctuary.
He said the doctorate he received
from the College of Divine Meta-
physics of Indianapolis was in sa-
cred scripture.
, Noegel estimates that there are
‘ about 100 loosely affiliated church-
es in the United States similar to
the one he founded.

“Our memberships

include
many former members of other re-
ligions who became disillusioned

with dogmatic faiths,” he'said. “If

 

' the churches have one thing in com-

mon, it is simply a reverence for all
forms of life,” he said.

In a lecture he delivered in 1984
in Orlando to a gathering of avicul-
turists, or bird breeders, Noegel of-
fered, “There is within every living
thing a consciousness capable of
touching all living things.
five men and women of all ages
have recognized the existence of
this connecting link and have uti-
lized it to the betterment of all con-
cerned.”

“Ramon is a very interesting
person and his success rate is phe-
nomenal,” said Cindy Kuehler, an
avian reproduction specialist at the
world-renowned San Diego Zoo.

“He’s probably the best in the world"

at breeding Amazon parrots.”
Kuehler visited Noegel and Moss
at their Seffner headquarters two

years ago when she was touring var- .

ious avian breeding facilities
throughout the nation for ideas that
could be adopted by the San Diego
Zoo.

“Bird-breeding is part science
and part what some would call
witchcraft,” Kuehler said.

“Under normal circumstances,
Amazon parrots tend to be scream-
ers. They make some really horri-
ble noises a lot of the time, especial-
ly when strangers are around. I was
amazed at how calm and quiet Ra-

Sensi-_ .

mon’s birds were. Their behavior
certainly is not the norm,” she said.
Noegel and Moss are using a
type .of suspended aviary that is be-
coming accepted rapidly all over
the world. In Europe it is called the

’ “Ramon Aviary,” and in Australia it

is called the “Noegel Cage.”
“There are many different

breeding methods,” said Moss, the.

27-year-old curator who began his
career cleaning cages at the sanctu-
ary 14 years ago. “Our methods
work for us. They might not work
for others.”

The .most important method
used at the sanctuary is simply to
“listen to” and observe the animals.
Both Noegel and Moss maintain that
if there is a breeding problem, the
animal invariably will try to com-
municate to the breeders what is
wrong. If those observing the situa-
tion are astute enough, the problem
will be detected and perhaps solved,
they said.

As difficult as that is for some to
accept, it seems to work.

Five years ago, the Cayman Is-

' land government appealed to Noe-

gel and Moss to accept seven of the
last nine Grand Cayman blue igua-
nas on the islands. The idea was to
captive breed the large reptile.
They eventually hope to repopulate
the island with the animals.‘

The majority of the specimens

received were well advanced in
age, and the outlook was grim. But
through the use of special diets and
habitats, 17 young have been
batched in the last three years.

The Cayman Islands also provid-
ed Noegel and Moss with Cayman
Brac Amazon parrots to breed.
They were the first in the world to
do so, meeting with success in 1981.

The governments of Puerto Rico
and St. Vincent have sent Cuban
iguanas and St. Vincent’s parrots,
respectively, to the sanctuary for
like reasons.

“Noegel is quite a gentleman.
He’s one of the most respected avi- ‘
culturists and conservationists in
the field today,” said Dr. Richard E.
Baer, past president and special ad-
viser to the American Federation of
Aviculture.

It may be that Noegel and Moss
don’t see their efforts as purely no-
ble, as others seem to. They may be
motivated by selfish reasons, in the
best sense of the word.

Both men say they feel dimin-
ished when an animal is classified
as extinct; the loss is taken person-
all . ' ,
yAt different times, they each
quoted the words of , Marcus Aure-
lius, a second—century Roman em-
peror: ‘

“There is but one mind, one law,
one principle, one substance, and I
am one with all there is.” _

California Veterinarian Treats Sea Birds

By RAY HAMILTON
For GRIT . ,
R. W. JOEL PASCO, who oper-

in Sunset Beach, Calif, is one
of 10 veterinarians working
with the Alliance of Wildlife Rehabilita-
tion and Education, a non-proﬁt referral

 

" program for the care and protection of ‘

displaced and injured wildlife. Many of
his patients are sea birds, so it is logical
that the hospital is situated the beach
facing the Paciﬁc Ocean.

The intensive care unit has been open
i to a parade of other species including
,: jack rabbits, squirrels, coyotes, hawks,
5 owls, sea lions, seals and wolves. Dr.
’ Pasco’s most recent house guest, how-
} ever, is a pelican.

; “All animals coming into the/hospital
ward are under some stress,” says Dr.

Pasco, “some due to old age, food P0P _

soning, ﬂea bites, anemia, or disabled
by gunshot wounds or fractures as a
result of being hit by autos.”

The free medical service is open 24
hours each day. Dr. Pasco, who main-
tains an emergency hotline number,
lives above the hospital, an arrange
ment that makes it convenient for early

. morning calls.

Birds and/or animals that recover are
returned to the wilds or go into sanctu-
ries or are placed with a family that has
been licensed by the state fish-and-
game commission.

“Rusty”, a surfing bird, was found
four weeks ago, obviously sick and
unable to fend for himself. ,He was suf-
fering from food poisoning and was
found by a surfer at nearby Seal Beach.
Animal-control ofﬁcers took him to Pas-
qo’s veterinary hospital.

“He probably ingested some large

ﬁsh which had toxic chemicals in its
body,” says Pasco. “Many ocean ﬁsh
will absorb chemicals dumped into the
sea. Birds eat the ﬁsh and in turn, are
poisoned.” »

Pasco has given Rusty tender, loving
care. The two are seen daily along the
beach with Rusty perched on Pasco’s
shoulder. The ﬁrst week, Rusty was ﬂy-
ing 10 feet and was able to come down
for a perfect landing. By the third week,
he was making 40~ to 60-yard ﬂights and

-- started hopping over the waves.

"Pasco believes Rusty has reached his
full size. Twice a day he is fed one-to-
two pounds of rock cod, swordﬁsh and
salmon. He takes two-or—three showers
each day and goes surﬁng every after-
noon. Pasco has the bird on a special
exercise program, letting him ﬂy twice
daily to strengthen his six-foot wings-
pan. ' -

Rusty likes the daily surfing, says

Pasco. “I put him in the water and he
wave hops pretty well. When he gets
tired, he jumps back on the board with
me and rests.” ,

Greg Hickman, an officer of the ‘
Alliance of Wildlife Rehabilitation and ‘,
Education believes Rusty enjoys the ;
relationship with Pasco. ..

“He gets excited when he knows he’s
going outside for exercise,” Pasco says. ;
“He’ll wag his tail feathers and spread '
out his wings and release a high pitched 5
sound. He has learned to catch ﬁsh on E
the ﬂy and jumps off the surf board to '
pick up small tibits.” '

Dr. Pasco has turned the bird over to 1
Greg Hickman, who will take Rusty on '
board his ﬁshing boat. They will travel
26 miles to Catalina Island where Rusty '
will be released after being fed enough
fresh ﬁsh, to give him energy for a cou- .
ple of days of trial ﬂights going directly
into the wind.

Researchers say mortality rate
of dolphins higher than expected

The New York Times -
TRENTON, N.J. -— Marine biol-
ogists searching for cities tn he

Chesapeake Bay on Tuesday and
discovered that the problem is more
widespread than they had suspected.
“They found that half of the dol~

spokesman for the scientists, Brian
Gorman. “The mortality rate is
higher than expected.” _
- The scientists also received
some bad news from a'United

Robert Schoelkopf, the director

the 56 dolphins that have come

said northwesterly winds prevented
the dolphin carcasses from coming
inshore today. “When the wind
shifts around to the south or south-

Same say thesedOQs are only
as responsible as their owners,
but recent attacks in Houston ‘

7 and the rest of the country V

1 have created quite a controversy

By BARBARA BOUGHTON V i
Post Reporter 7 ' .

gentlest of creatures, he said, a dog that had never

The man held the dog in his arms and cried. It was the .

done any harm. But it was also a pit bull, a breed with :

alvicious reputation, and the neighbors had started to com-

p am. .

7 The man was afraid of what might happen if his dog sud-
denly did attack. He knew he would be liable. So he surren-

dered it to the Houston Society for the Prevention of Cruelty -

to Animals (HSPCA) to be humanely euthanized. There, it
wagged its tail and licked the hands of SPCA workers. But as
soon as it was penned up with other dogs, it attacked, .fero- ,

, crously digging its teeth into the other animals’ flesh.

After numerous attacks on adults -—- and more horribly,
children -— both in Houston and across the country, the pit
bull has become the object of nationwide media attention,

. gaining a reputation as the meanest of breeds. In fact, a story
on the pit bull, “Beware of this Dog,” made the cover of
Sports Illustrated on July 27. It also has been the focus of Time
and other magazines. And, pit bulls were the subject of the

_ Donahue show last. Tuesday.

As the controversy continues, some experts claim the anil—

, mal lS man’s worst foe, others maintain it is still man’s best

friend. . .

. Its detractors say it is vicious by its very nature. Its defend-
ers say the pit bull is a wonderful pet, but those bred for vio-
lence by inhumane breeders are causing all pit bulls to be un-

fairly labeled as dangerous. .

As reports of attacks have increased, so has national con-
cern. Many people are afraid of the pit bull. Even owners are

succumbing to the growing fears. More than ever before, they.

are turning in their dogs to be euthanized, locally and across
the country, animal shelters report. In Los Angeles, more than

“ 300 pit bulls and pit bull cross-breeds were turned in to the

city’s animal control department in the three weeks following

' two grisly June attacks in California. 2 . .
' “I’m frightened of them," says Anita Glosson, 32, a Hous-
' ton postal carrier who was attacked by two pit bull dogs in '
March 1986. “I don’t think they should be allowed any- -
where.” During the attack, pit bulls tore into both her arms
‘j . and she had to be treated for multiple bites at a hospital. “I
was back on the job in 10 days, but mentally I still haven’t re-
. tcovkered," she says. She still has scars on her arms from the at.
ac ., " ' ~ . . ' ' .
Since 1983, the pit bull, which makes up 1 percent of the
dog population in the United States, has been responsible
for 21 of the 29 deaths from maul-
ings —- including six this year. In
Houston and surrounding areas,
nine pit bull maulings have occured
since October 1985. In 1984, 4-'
year-old James Dwayne Miller was
. killed by a pit bull in Montgomery
; County. The dog’s owner, James _
“Bryant Traxler, was found guilty of .
, reckless behavior leading to the ‘
‘ wrongful injury of a child and sen—
tenced to five vears. in prison.

E 0 Last month, a pit bull terrier —
-’i described by its owner as “nice and
l precious” — escaped from a
E fenced back yard and charged two
l Houston policemen after mauling
t two other dogs. In January, two pit
bulls attacked a 6-year-old and his
, 3-year-old sister in North Harris
County, taking hunks out of one
child’s face, neck, arms, back, leg
and cutting the other child’s leg.
In early June, 2-year-old James
Soto of Morgan Hill, Calif, died of
severe bites to the head and neck;
’ he was so badly‘mauled, he was
' unrecognizable as a human being,
; paramedics said.
‘ In Houston, Raylene Smith and
’ Frankie Trahan, two neighbors,
., were mauled by pit bulls in No-
vember 1985, in a bloody attack
that has since become the subject
of radio and television shows.
Smith, 45, was the most seriously
injured. The two pit bulls took
j chunks out of her legs, thighs and
arms and bit her stomach. “There

was so much blood,” she says. “I
thought ‘they’re killing me and l
‘ can’t stop them.

by Chippy Trahan, a neighbor’s
son, who hit the dogs with a rifle
butt. After the attack, Smith had

four hours of surgery and was un-
able to walk for four months.

She now intends to sue the Own—
er of the dogs, seeking a million
dollars in punitive damages and
reparation for medical expenses,
which are likely to run about
$30,000, according to her lawyer,
Jack Zimmermann. She also wants
strict vicious dog legiSlation passed
in every state, and has appeared on
ABC’s Good Morning America
and CBS’s Oprah Winfrey Show to
publicize her cause.

" She is still terrorized by the
memory of the attack. Recently,
when she heard something that
sounded like dogs outside her
house, she started crying hysteri-

i: ‘cally. “I don’t ever want to see a pit

bull again,” she says.

»... The cause of all this fear is a dog

with a squat, muscular body, rang-
" ing from 20 to 100 pounds, and

.. thick, steel-trap jaws. It is descend-

ed from the fighting bulldogs of

19th-century England. Originally
bred for bull-baiting (putting dogs

; in a ring to torment a bull), the pit

i hull was bred to fight other dogs in
the pit. Though the practice was
outlawed by the English Parliament
in 1835, it still continues. In the

United States the violent, bloodlet-
_ ting sport is popular even though it

is a felony in most states, including .

Texas. Bets on these fights run as

high as $10,000 or more, according

to animal cruelty investigators.

But in England, there have been
few pit bull attacks. The reason: the
English attitude toward animal cru.

programs for the Humane Society ‘
of the United States. Strong vicious
dog laws are widely enforced in
England.

' ’ The pit bull is not a breed of dog
—— but rather a kind terrier. Pure-
bred pit bulls are registered as
American Staffordshire terriers
with the American Kennel Club
and as the American pit bull terriers
with the United Kennel Club. But
pit bulls can be a combination of
breeds; they come in any color,
their ears may be cropped or un-
crOpped and their noses either red ’

or black. . _
Though the claim IS disputed by

- the dog’s defenders -— some ani-

mal experts and dog owners —
other experts say the killer instinct
is in the dog’s blood. When the pit
bull attacks, it doesn’t merely bite
— it clamps its jaws down and lit—
erallytears its victim apart. And it
keeps on attacking. “The pit bull
likes to fight and it will fight until
his victim is dead,” says Dr. Robert
Shannon, veterinarian and execu-
tive vice president of the Houston
SPCA. “They just enjoy getting
hold of something and destroying
it. They’re killer dogs — a cocked
pistol.”

‘ They also can withstand pain —
so it’s not easy to deter an attack—
ing pit bull. “They’re bred to take a
lot of punishment and to continue
to fight,” says Dr. Robert Arm-
strong, chief of the Bureau of Ani-
mal Regulation and Care in the
City of-Houston Health Depart-
ment. “They have no fear. They
can go into a frenzy and;will even
attack dead animals.”

There are at least 4,000 pit bulls
in Houston, Armstrong says. The
Bureau of Animal Regulation and
Care does not keep statistics on ..
how many Houston maulings have ’
been caused by pit bulls, but Arm-
strong says that most of the bu—
reau’s “bad” cases are the result of

*2. ‘ pit bull attacks. 99999“ bitten by_

a pit bull required 150 stitches in
her face. “Some dogs herd by in-
stinct, others retrieve,” Armstrong
says. “The pit bull’s instinct is to
fight until he’s exhausted.” The an-
imals are especially dangerous, he
adds, because they don’t signal
their attacks; they don’t growl or
bark and the hair on their back
doesn’t rise. “The pit bull just in-
stinctively goes for the throat.”

In the last few years, as pit bulls
have acquired a reputation for
meanness, more sadistic owners
have sought to breed them for
fighting, according to Sherry Fer-
guson, executive director of the
Houston Humane Society. They
train them to be vicious by inflict-

ing a varietyof cruglhpu'nishments:

running them on treadmills, feed-
ing them gunpowder and hot
sauce, letting them attack kittens
and small dogs. They also work to
increase the dog’s jaw strength by
making them hang from tires
looped to trees or from tree limbs.
Sometimes, the dogs are com-
manded to hold on for as long as 15
or 20 minutes.

In Houston, the dogs are often
fought in ghetto areas, Houston
Humane Society officials report,
and are frequently mistreated.

“It’s a trendy thing,” says Fergu—
son. After the fights, the injured
dogs are commonly left to die on
the sidewalk. “We’ve taken in
some dogs that have been scarred
very badly from past fights,” F er-
guson says. '

For young ghetto boys, the pit
bull has become a status symbol —-
like a gun or a knife. “They can
walk down the street in a rough
neighborhood with their dog and
that dog says ‘don’t mess with
me,’ ” Shannon says. “It’s a macho
thing. We often get requests from
redneck teen-agers and from tough

black and Hispanic teen-agers. ‘

They come in and say ‘give me the
meanest pit bull you got.’ ”

Increasingly, the pit bull has be-
come the dog of choice among
drug dealers, Ferguson says. They ~
are used as guard dogs for crack,
cocaine and other drugs and for the
proceeds that the dealers take in
each day. In Philadelphia, dogs
with names like Murder, Hitler and
Scarface — trained to be incredibly

vicious — sometimes wear metal
studded collars that conceal drugs
and money.

In May, several pit bulls were
picked up by law enforcement offi-

, cers in a Galveston County drug

' raid. “They were strategically
chained so that it was difficult to

. get the drugs,” says Tammy Sikes,
manager and cruelty investigator
for the Galveston County SPCA.
The dogs were scarred and aggres-

37 sive, and cruelty investigators be-

' lieved the dogs also had been used
for fighting. _

While housed in the SPCA, one
dog tore the ear off a passing dog.
Another pit bull, while caged in a
truck with steel bars, reached be-
tween the bars and “tore up the
face” of a pit bull waiting to be
boarded, Sikes says.

A witness testified the dogs had
been used for illegal fights, but the

- case was dismissed because there

1. were questions about his credibil— .

ity. The dogs were returned to their
' owner.

“We know that there’s a lot of pit
bull fighting but it’s hard to prove.
It’s very well hidden,” Sikes says.

Though it’s become infamous for
its aggression, the pit bull once had

a reputation as a peace-loving dog _,

; ers with gentle pit

. in America ~ a loyal pet. In the M
. early 20th Icentury it was a popular
. mascot. Buster Brown’s floppy-
eared pal iii a popular comic strip
'- was a pit bull. President Theodore
Roosevelt bad a pit bull in the A
White House. And a pit bull named
' Stubby, used in World'War I to de-
liver messages between battalions
aSSISied in the capture of a German
spy and was decorated for bravery.
In 1921, the most famous pit bull
of all burst onto the American
scene. He was Petie, a white pit
bull With a distinctive black circle
around his left eye -— and a canine
member of Our Gang comedies,
featuring a cast of children. More
recently, the pit bull was portrayed
as a dutiful pet in the movie Flash-
dagce. -

a pit bull breeder, has raised pit
bulls for 22 years. She also serves
as a pit bull judge at dog shows.

Her pit bull, Nipper, runs out, tail

wagging, to greet visitors. Nugent

says he sleeps with her every night.
Pit bulls are not more vicious than

other types of dogs,” she says. “In

Nugent says peo le are un -
sarily frightened of Igiven good1 Site S
bulls. “When I take my dogs out for
a walk, people are always surprised
to find out that these are the ones

that are so bad. Most people are
scared because they think pit bulls
are vicious, snarling monsters.”
Kevin Jackson, 21, who has two ,

_ pit bulls and uses one for “pulling”
— a sport in which dogs pull carts

r along rails’—— says the pit bull has

‘ been abused by the press. He ad-

, mits that the pit bull is stronger

‘ than most breeds but it’s not more
aggressive, he believes. Jackson,
whose dog can pull about 3,000
pounds, says his dog has won tro- .
phies and ribbons for her pulling
ability but is well-behaved. “For
us. the pit bulls are a family dog,”

 




.J' 83:4.w an...

. he says. His wife, Jennifer, is preg-

' nant. The Jacksons plan to keep

their pit bulls after their child is
born.

A cadre of experts agree the pit
, bull is not always dangerous.

“Pit bulls are presenting some
problems but they are people prob—
lems,” says Lockwood, of the Hu-
mane Society of the United States.
“There have always been fatalities
from dogs. That hasn’t changed.
What has changed is that they’re
now being caused by pit bulls. And
that’s happening because the pit
bull is the favorite dog of irrespon-
~ sible owners.”

Because of the recent attacks,
the American Dog Owners’ Associ-
ation, the American Kennel Club,
the United Kennel Club and the
Humane Society of the United
States are supporting vicious dog
laws. They are opposed to targeting
any one breed —— such as the pit
bull --— because they believe that
eliminating the pit bull would not '
solve the problem. “If you totally
annihilate the pit bull, you’ll still
have 70 percent of the dog prob-
lem,” says Andy Johnson, manager
of field operations for the United
Kennel Club. ’

Other dogs -— such as German
g Shepherds, Rottweilers and Dober-
man pinschers — have been
I; known to attack and injure, too. :’

, These dogs, in contrast to the pit
bull, tend to be dangerous because
of their large size — not their grip,
according to Armstrong, of the "
Bureau of Animal Regulation and
Care. They also have reputations as
lethal dogs, and are often used as
guard dogs. When irresponsible
and sadistic owners use them, the
results can be as harrowing as pit
bull attacks. Last year, several at-
tacks by large guard dogs occurred
in Houston. A 5-year-old girl was
hospitalized after an attack by a ',
Doberman pinscher. A 3-year—old
was bitten by a 125-pound Rott-‘f‘
weiler, which tore out a piece of .
her scalp. And a mixed-breed Ger-
man shepherd-Labrador bit a 4- ..
year-old boy in the face, resulting
in two hours of surgery. .‘

Johnson also points out that oth-
er dogs are more likely to bite than
the pit bull. In a recent Florida '
study, for instance, the pit bull was
not even among the top five dogs
rated most likely to bite. '

But since most recent attacks .7
have been by pit bulls, people are
more wary of them 7» at least 50
towns and some states, legislation
has been passed or is being rushed
through to ban pit bulls or levy jail
sentences and heavy fines on own- :
ers of dogs that do attack. In San,"
Antonio, a city ordinance banning

 

pit bulls currentlyis’being drafted
and will soon be considered by the
city council. The ordinance was in-
stituted after citizen requests, says
Dr. Katharine Rathbun, former di-

‘rector of the Health Department-3..

(Rathbun resigned last week). "
People were simply afraid of at- ‘j
tacks by pit bulls. Yet there have f
been protests of the bill, too. “Our
telephones are ringing off the wall.
This is one of those issues where“,
you hear from everybody,” she _
says. “
Other communities, fearing that
pit but? ordinances won’t solve the
problr' .m, have turned to vicious ;
dog legislation. The national Hue
mane Society has received more",
than 1700 requests in the last two;
months from communities all over
America for information about :
drafting vicious dog laws.
In Houston, a vicious dog ordi-.
nance was passed in 1985, raising
the fine to $600-$1,000 for people
who let dangerous dogs run loose;
And an ordinance, passed in June:
1986, allows for dangerous dogs +
those inflicting serious injury on a‘.
first offense or biting people twice;
within a year -— to be put to death
by lethal injection.
The Texas legislature recently. ‘ .
passed a law making it a criminal?
offense to own a vicious dog — a '
class B misdemeanor carrying a six
months prison sentence and
$1,000 fine. It also requires that ;
owners of vicious dogs must ca .
$100,000 in liability insurance. /
Laws are not the only result of ’
the recent attacks. There’s been a ’
backlash against the pit bull. Peo;
ple are fighting back. in Southwest
Houston, Isaac Miller, 37, led a peg-
tition drive to ban two pit bulls - ”
from his neighborhood. The dogs‘ :.
have already killed several dogs, I;
including Miller’s German shep~
herd, and are being trained by their
owners to fight, Miller says. His .
complaints —-— and the complaints:
of other neighbors — caused the}
Bureau of Animal Regulation and
Care to take action. They impound-
ed the dogs, which will be euthan;~
ized, and the owner was arrested:
and jailed for three outstanding ci-
tations —- running a dog at large, ’
having a dog without a license and
having a dog without a vaccination,
according to Chris Sargent, public '
information/education officer for °
the Bureau of Animal Regulation";~
and Care. Miller’s petition, which:
asks for more severe punishment .;
_— jail terms rather than fines .— :3

tor owners ot violent dog‘waas
presented to the Houston City .
Council and is being considered. L’
Unfortunately, all action taken is
against pit bulls hasn’t been legal.-‘:
Some people are using violence to;
vent their anger at the dog. In Gil-5
roy, Calif, a pit bull was killed with
a shovel while chained in a yard. Ii}
Revere, Mass, the bullet-riddled pt
body of a pit bull with a noose 5‘
around its neck was found floating?
in a creek. In Houston, owners like
Mike Wheeler, 28, a designer if
draftsmen, keep their dogs locked?
in pens with chain link fences. He’s
afraid that children in the neighbor";-
hood will throw bricks or sticks at
the dogs and provoke them. “I’ll go
to extreme measures to protect my:
dogs from people,” he says. ‘2
So what’s the solution? For T“
Lockwood, of the national Humané
Society, banning the pit bull or re-J’
acting with violence is not it. “Dog;
fighting should be declared a felony
and the laws against it should be r:
strengthened. We advocate strong”?
vicious dog laws. Pit bull fatalities

, Months of hysteria
to a distorts

By DAVID McHUGH
Free Press Staff Writer

The woman rushed her bleeding, .
partly paralyzed pet dog to Crest- trespassmg on a
view Animal Hospital in Kalamazoo, ‘ ~ , .;: _. ,; K. porch 0" Santa
telling workers there it had been t , ., -. f3 --, g; 5 , Clara Avenue-
mauled by a pit bull. ‘

But when X-rays were taken,
veterinarian Steven Ginsberg found
a bullet lodged in the dog’s back.

The incident this spring high-
lights what Ginsberg and animal
control experts in MiChigan say has
become an increasing problem
among humans: pit bull panic.

Some pit bulls — animals de-
scended from English fighting terri-
ers —- do indeed pose a serious and
growing threat, the animal experts
say. But they say media hype and
public hysteria over pit bulls ob-
scures a broader problem with at-
tacks by dogs of any breed.

The climate of emotionalism has
resulted in a rush to pass anti-pit bull
laws that don’t address the broader
problem, they said.

“If you notice, in the last six
months the only attacks mentioned
in the media have been by pit bulls,”
said David Wills, director of the
Michigan Humane SoCiety. “You
can't tell me German shepherds
didn’t attack anyone in those six
months.” "

Dr. Randy Lockwood, a dog-at-
tack expert with the Humane SoCi-
ety of the United States in Washing-
ton D.C., said some of the ConCern
was legitimate, but that “there is
also hype and hysteria.”

In recent months, pit bulge nave
appeared on the Cover of Sports Illus-
trated, been featured on ABC-TV’s

“Nightline,” and written up in the Wall

Street Journal. Proposals for anti-pit

bull laws are before the Detroit City. :
Council and the Michigan Legislature. ‘5
Said Lockwood: “Any solution that

focuses exclusively on pit bulls is going
to be a short-sighted solution, and will
become ineffective when the problem
becomes Chews or akitas or rottwei-
lersf’

These are other reCent examples of
pit bull panic dulled from news reports
and interviews with police and animal
control experts:

’0... In March, animal Control officials

éaptured and killed a dog, reported to ‘

be a pit bull, that had attacked a
Highland Park man. When the mem-
gan Humane Society examined the
carcass, they discovered the dog was a
ﬁerman shepherd-spaniel mix. '

Q Fearful pit bull owners have been
bringing their dogs to be destroyed at
the Detroit Humane Society at a rate of
18-20 a month. .

0 Callers to the Detroit Animal Con-
trol Center routinely cry “pit bull,”
hoping the now frightful term will get
them a quicker response to Complaints,
say workers at the center.

0 In July, an Airedale, a large, wiry»
coated breed of terrier, attacked a six.»
year-old Holly Township girl playing
in a sandbox. The dog tore off part of
the girl’s scalp, hit her legs, back and
arm, and inflicted wounds that took
100 stitches to close. The attaCk appar-
ently went unnoticed by reporters who
had, a few weeks earlier, given promi-
nent attention to pit bull attacks in
Detroit, Warren and Redford Town-
ship that resulted in comparatively
minor injuries.

That is not to say pit bulls Cannot be
extremely dangerous.

0f 28 people killed nationwide by
dog attacks sinCe 1983, 20 have been
killed by pit bulls, which comprise an
estimated two percent of the total dog
population. A 1986 study by the Hu-
mane Society of 250 deg attacks
showed non-fatal pit bull attacks are

more likely to result in stitches, hospi- ‘
talization, or surgery than non-fatal f

attacks from other dogs.

To make matters worse, pit bulls
have become a “macho” symbol just as ,

l

Doberman pinsc‘hers and German shep- 4‘
; herds were in the past, said Lockwood. 3

Nevertheless, experts say, single-
minded focus on pit bulls takes atten-
tion away from statistiCs that show

. other dogs also Can be dangerous.

A study by the Detroit Animal

Control Center in which 1,322 animal :

bites investigated in 1986 were ana-
lyzed, bears out that contention to
some degree.

The majority were by mutts (28
percent) or German shepherds (25 per-
cent.) Pit bulls accounted for 12 per-
cent, or 1.56 bites —-- the third-largest
category.

In Oakland County, the biggest bit-
ers among more than 1,000 attacks a
year are likewise German shepherds
and mixed breeds, said Carl Anderson,
director of animal Control.

The anti-pit bull ordinance proposal
before the Detroit City Council would
require that pit bulls be registered with
the city and tattooed with a number so
owners can be traced if their dog
injures someone. The proposal before
the state Legisﬂure would require
registration and liability insurance for
the dogs.

THE HUMANE SOCIETY, in Criti-

_ cizing such measures, notes that all
, dogs have to be registered under cur-

rent licensing laws. And the soCiety
estimates that 80 to 90 percent of

Detroit‘s dogs are unlicensed, raising ‘

questions about the effectiveness of. a)

'.tougher registration requir_ement.:.-..

 

' r peopte who would most likely
comply with the law are people who
are already in ComplianCe.

“These people will get the insur-
ance and register their dogs,” Lock-
wood said. Those “with the dogs
, guarding their dope houses won’t even
, know the law has been passed, which is
why we need to get a more long-term
solution.”

What is really needed, he said, are

. laws giving animal control officials the -

, power to classify a dog as dangerous

‘ before it attacks or kills someone, and
imposing penalties on owners of any
dog that attacks.

Lockwood, along with Wills and

. others, said he thOught there was a

1 chance the pit bull controversy might

push through more of such laws and

, raise the public’s consciousness about

; bad dogs:

“The one good thing that might =

i come out of this is that people and

2-1 public officials are beginning to recog-

i nize the extreme importance of effec-
' tive animal control.”

Dear Mr. Pope:

In.April of this year I had a form.letter from you re
my letter about the horribly inhumane situation with
regard to laying hens in this country.

Since I first heard of these deplorable conditions
from the Humane Society of the U.S., I have not eaten
an egg, and I do not intend to do so until I know the
eggs I am eating come from chickens raised in a humane
manner - not factory farmed.

It is a little difficult for me to believe anything will
really be done when I read from The.American Farm Bureau
Federation_policies for 1986: "we oppose any legislation

or regulatory actions which would.tend to prohibit good
poultry and livestock husbandry practices and increase

costs of food.to consumers. If this means they are going

to continue to raise laying hens in the deplorable conditions
reported by the HSUS, then they are going to be in a lot of
trouble, because I am.confident humane—minded individuals
will stop eating eggs until something is done.

lheir Farm Bureau Policies on the whole are really ridiculous,
and are reaching into things which have nothing to do with
raising meat animals or laying hens.

May I hear from you as to where in the Atlanta area I can
be sure of buying eggs which are from laying hens raised
in a humane manner?

Thank you.

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough

Gentlemen:

In March of this year, the Humane Society of the U;S.
sent a notice to their members of the factory farming
of laying hens in America.

It really sickened me, and from that day I have not
eaten an egg, nor do I intend to do so until I know
the eggs I eat are from hens raised in a humane man—
ner. Anyone with any compassion for a living creat—
ure know5how much enjoyment a hen gets from simply
pecking around the ground. It is part of the nature
of a chicken to do that. The conditions reported by
HSUS were really deplorable, and I am confident that
farmers are going to lose a lot of egg—eating.Ameri~

cans if they don't change their way of raising these
birds.

Can you give me the name of any outlet in the Atlanta
area where I can buy eggs which come from farms where
laying hens and chickens are raised in.a humane manner,
and not crammed inside tiny battery cages Where the
birds are unable to stretch their wings, preen, or sit‘
comfortably when laying their eggs.

It is really disgusting and nauseating to learn that

any human being would confine any living creature in
such a manner.

Sincerely,

Gentlemen:

It has been several months since I wrote to you re the
horrible conditions of factory farming reported by the
Humane Society of the U.S.

It is now almost the middle of August, and I have yet to
receive a reply from any of you as to what is being done
in Congress to end this horrible ”factory farming". Is
Congress and the farmer going to wait until Americans
mount a boycott and refuse to eat eggs, pork and beef
until these living creatures are raised in a humane
manner?

I just read today — and have misplaced the article — that

a Bill has been introduced to stop the way calves are being
raised for veal. This is another deplorable case of factory
farming and sickening to read about. If this is the case,
and this has been introduced in Congress, I urge you gentle—
men to support this Bill. Someone has got to put a foot
down on the treatment of these animals. It is bad enough
we kill and eat them, we can at least see that they are
raised in a humane manner. As the National Humane Education
Society has reported — "If consumers are given the facts
about inhumane calf—rearing methods, it is doubtful that
even the gourmet will insist on the so-called white veal".

Factory farming must stop — it is as simple as that - and
if it does not, then the farmer has only himself to blame
in what will surely result — the boycotting of animals and
birds raised in an inhumane manner.

Please let me hear from you on these matters which are of
grave concern to me. I am not a vegetarian, but I have not
eaten veal nor eggs fer a long, long time, and I shall not
do so until there is no longer factory farming.

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Connie Yarbrough

Tim Prutzer painted the background for the duck—
bili case at the Denver Zoo.

1.1..

f Zoo backgrounds keep
gpainteron fast pace; .

By Claire Martin
Denver Post Staff Writer

Here is Tim Prutzer’s secret for painting realisti-
cally swaying bamboo stalks: He dips his brush in a
can of paint, stands back, grips the brush and hurls
the paint as if he’s swinging a polo mallet.

“See that? That's how I get these long, graceful

"l l‘
if

lines, just throw it on the wall, literally,” said Prutzer, *

who himself is thin as a bamboo stalk - a bamboo
stalk with curly black hair and spattered painter’s
paints. , ,
Since October, Prutzer, 34, has been painting Ma-
laysian jungle scenes for white-crested jay thrushes,
, an Australian outback for a kookaburra, a Chinese
bamboo thicket for some hunting cissas, the margin ‘~
of an estuary fora lesser golden plover and some oth-

er sea birds, plus half a dozen or so other dioramas .. .

for the exhibits at the Denver Zoo’s birdhouse. Prutzo

er’s paintings enliven walls that once were the visual- .

' eQuivalent of Spam - serviceable but lifeless ex-
.panses of brown, yellow or green, suggesting land and
forest, capped with a wavy topping of skylike blue.
Do the birds notice the difference? Not likely;
they’re probably just relieved to be returned to their

DENVER POST - August 4, 1987

cages in the back room 'while Prutzer paints their per

. manent dwellings.

. - ~ The visitors do notice, though, particularly after he :
ing startled by finding, in the cage labeled “Kookabur- .

. ’ra,” Prutzer furiously painting
‘ mountains lit by the lemony lig

bamboo stalks and
ht of the late afternoon

’ sun. After recovering from the initial shock, visitors
who fancy themselves wits tap onthe glass.
; ~ “That’s the biggest kookaburra I’ve ever seen i"
. they yell, or “Look! A painter bird!” and things like

that. _, . .
Prutzer often obliges his audience by pausmgﬁand W. i

r.

imitating wings with his reedy arms, and calling
“Braaak! Braaaak!” Occasionally, the “painter

; bird,” whose ever-changing hab.
. ied yet uniformly close and humi

itats are visually var-
d, only ignores the

jocular visitors. This is a tactic adopted by many long-

time zoo residents.

“1 have to really be patient sometimes,” Prutzer
said recently, referring to the visitors who were tap-
ping on the glass panel of the cage where he was

painting yet another bamboo grove for a pair of hunt-

’ issas. a Chinese bird.
“mg CA , ..

“When I get tired, that gets on
my nerves. Although usually I can
ham it up for ’em. But I’m on a
terrible deadline — one scene per
month —- and I really have to paint
quickly. I have to mix colors right
on the wall Here's an example."

He dipped a paint brush in green
paint — his medium is Sinclair
House Paint - and swiftly made
streaks on a curving line of paint
'he had already thrown on the wall.

. “See? I put on green paint here,
and then I put on orangeand let it
bleed into khaki, OK? It really
looks better than if I tried to paint
it carefully. More realistic. And
here, I start off with an orangey
color like this, for a leaf. That indi-
cates the dead area at the edge of
the leaf. Then I introduced the liv-
ing green color in the middle with
another streak. How does that
look?”

It looked pretty good, in fact. Of
course, Prutzer has spent more
than half his life painting diora-
mas, starting at the Denver Muse-
um of Natural History. He looked

at the diorama backgrounds there

when he was 8 years old and

wished he could paint scenes like .
. that. When he was 16, he returned ;
* to the museum to ask for a job. i

The director refused, telling Prutz-

er to return after aduatin from
high school. gr g

“What if I volunteer?” Prutzer

. asked him.

“Hey! We can talk!” is how he

remembers the director’s reply.

So Prutzer began painting back-

______

they used that one, but later, after "
he was hired, he spent five years
working on backgrounds for the
Coyote diorama and the group
scene of the guanco (a llamaer
creature). '

After that, he spent two years
painting dioramas for a nature re~
serve center in Johannesburg,
South Africa. When he returned to
Colorado, he painted three murals
for the Wildlife World in Monu-
ment, and later won the job at the
zoo. ‘

“This is basically representa-
tional work, but I try to get as ab-
stract as I can and still look real,”

, he said, a little apologetically, look-

ing at his work with a parent’s
proud, nervous eye. .

On the whole, he seems to enjoy
this job, which has been financed

’srounds. starting in the planetari-

through a foundation grant from
Chase Manhattan Bank. He likes
birds and tells affectionate stories
about his wife’s dwarf parrot. It '
perches on the shoulder of which--
ever family member, in his opin-
ion, has the most appealing break-
fast and then purloins bites from

the fork. ’

Prutzer’s job has its drawbacks,

gchiefly the lack of respect from
gallery owners, although he does

have his fans: He has already sold

Tone painting, a scale model of a

beach scene, to Paul Vance, one of
the zoo keepers. The other short-
comings are minor annoyances.

“I have to clean brushes all day
long, so I really know what dishpan
hands are,” he said, rinsing out a
gummy brush in a sink

PEOPLE WEEKLY - August 17, 1987

LYSOUN SEAGAT
IS NUMBER ONE IN
UKA’S HEART—
A WHISKER

ike all good teachers, Alysoun Sea-
cat regards her pupils as individuals.
You couldn’tjust tempt Mimi with a fish
and expect her to jump through hoops.
Shy Mimi, a young dolphin, had to be
coaxed. Finally, after three weeks of
persuasion, she did it—and got not
only the fish but plenty of praise.

Nuka, the walrus, on the other hand,
was quick on the uptake. “She was so
eager that if I didn’t stay one step
ahead of her, she would get one step
ahead of me,” says Seacat, the 30»
year-old Daryl Hannah lookalike who is
director of training at the New York
Aquarium on Coney Island. The Call-
fornia-bred Seacat (her own honest-to-
cod name) has trained mischievous
sea lions and reluctant penguins, cap-
tivated dolphins and even tamed a
6,000-lb. killer whale (“You can’t use in-
timidation,” she says. “A whale can
just swim'away”).

Then there is her prize pupil, Nuka,
definitely a prima donna. “When she
isn’t performing a show, audiences can
catch her sunbathing on a rock in a
kind of Playboy pose,” says Seacat.
“She not only performs the stunts we
teach her on cue, but she has come up
with her own—like hosing down the au-
dience and whistling at them. She’s a
regular Whoopi Goldberg.”

Seacat has also made audiences
jump through hoops-Since 1983, when
she began training the animals and
mounting the shoWs at the aquarium,
yearly attendance has soared—from
450,000 to more than 700,000. After all,
there aren’t many places you can see
a woman swimming with a beluga
whale and putting her hand in its mouth
to stroke its tongue. (Whales love it.)

If Seacat has managed to puzZle out
the behavior of sea creatures, one spe-
cies of land mammal still eludes her:
man. “I’d be on a date, and the guy
would look into my eyes and ask me why
I smell of fish,” she laments. “Fish
scales would fall out of my hair at the
most inopportune moments. One gen—
tleman brought me home early, explain-
ing that mermaids weren’t his type.”

Well, she still has Nuka. And with a
walrus, that fishy smell is the aroma of
which beautiful friendships are made.

USA TODAY

The dog-bites-man story has

taken a vicious turn: Dog

The pit bull terrier has ac-
quired a steel-jawed reputa-
tion bigger than its medium —
but all-business — size, un-
leashing fears and laws in

across the USA. 7 , -

since it was a pup.

w— .
In Chicago last week, a teen

who ordered his pit bull to attack his holdup victim was con-
victed of armed robbery.

And in Concord, Calif., Saturday, a pit bull led police on a
l-mile chase, jumping six-foot fences and sending children
and adults scattering in panic before it was captured.

Since 1983, pit bulls have been blamed for 21 of 28 dog-
attack deaths. So far this year, pit bulls were the culprit in
'all six deaths. _ , - . »

Despite all the casualties, the breed still has defenders

“I’d leave my kids alone with these dogs before I’d leave
them alone with a lot of people I know,” said Beth Bailey of

 

more than 50 communities

Clinton, Conn.', as her 9-month-old daugh-
ter played with the family’s pit bull terri-
er in her yard.

But many people are just plain afraid.

“They’re like little bombs just waiting
to go o ,” says Lorne Winbigler of Tim-
pa, whose daughter, Nicole, 3, recently
was attacked. She needs plastic surgery.

“Children just naturally love animals
and they’ll walk right up to them,” she
says. “With pit bulls, they don’t know
what they’re walking up'to.”

Fear of pit bulls is causing widespread
destruction of gentler members of the
breed, as owners of well-bred pit bulls
have them put to sleep out of fear their
pets might turn on them. Between 50 and
100 were destroyed in Des Moines during
the ﬁrst half of the year.

Not everyone is so cautious. Some peo-
ple admire the dog’s viciousness, and that

- demand is breeding killers. In Lawrence,

Mass, last May, a man chased by a pit
bull collapsed and died of a heart attack.
When word got out that the dog was at
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, the phone began ringing Six
callers wanted to own the dog

“That’s frightening,” says shelter di-
rector Carter Luke. “There are a lot of
people out there who want the biggest
gun, the sharpest knife, the baddest dog
they can ﬁnd. They’re turned on by it”

This sudden demand for the once-
cherished terrier has caused unscrupu-

. lous breeders to breed for meanness.-

The pit bull’s supporters say their dogs

are loyal and affectionate. “They’re

great with kids,” says Bailey. “They want
to climb on your lap and sleep on your
bed.” Amos, her tiger-striped male, is
used in “pet therapy” at nursing homes
and day-care centers.

“They’re marvelous dogs when you

breed them right,” says Virginia Izaak of

Placerville, Ca1if., whose pit bulls play
with her grandchildren. “You can trust
them implicitly.”

No way, say members of one of the
groups most vulnerable to domiThe let-
ter carriers are deathly afraid of them,”
says Dan Demiglio, an Oakland, Calif.,
Postal Service ofﬁcial. “There have been
10 serious attacks in my sector alone.”

Part of the pit bull’s reputation may
not he deserved. A survey done by the
city of West Palm Beach, Fla, found
Chows, Rottweilers and other dogs
caused more serious injuries. But the
public “thinks that anything with short
hair that bites someone is a pit bull,” says
Oakland trainer Patricia Cook. '

Owners are harassed by fearful neigh-
bors. And, in a gruesome twist, some dogs
are being brutalized. “We’re getting re-
ports that innocent dogs are being poi-
soned, shot, hung, burned and strangled,”
says Randall Lockwood, of the Humane
Society’s national ofﬁce. .

Experts are cautious. “These dog can

and do make good pets, but they also can
'be extremely dangerous,” says Sheryl

Blair of the “hits Center for Animals.
“They ﬁght to the end and beyond.”

A cross between bulldog and terrier,
the pit bull goes back to early 19th centu-
ry England where it Was bred to ﬁght in
the ring. But the dog got its reputation for
derring-do in the USA, ﬁnding a home in
Teddy Roosevelt’s White House. Pete,
the Our Gang dog in movies and TV, and
Tige, the ﬁoppy—eared Buster Brown
symbol, were pit bulls.

In those days, the dog was treasured
for its tenacity, courage and loyalty.

Then all that changed. Like the Ger-
man shepherd, the Doberman pinscher
and others easily bred to ﬁght and pro-
tect, the pit bull is now bred as a weapon.
Drug dealers use them to protect their
stash. Inner-city youths strut them as sta-

tus symbols. They’ve been used to intimi-

date crime victims.

“It’s the macho thing to do,” says
Elaine Newton of Philadelphia’s SPCA.
“Almost every one we get belong to a
youth. The kids are using them as poten-
tial weapons. If you can’t get a handgun,
get a pit bull. It the one thing that makes
them feel superior.” '

' One beneﬁcial side eﬁ‘ect of the prob-
lem is that it has prompted communities
to restrain vicious dogs of all breeds.

But laws like one passed last month in
Santa Clara, Calif. — banning new pit
bulls and requiring owners insure and
control them -— will be challenged be-
cause they single out one breed.

Experts want tough laws regulating all
vicious dog.

“If communities would only wake up
to the fact that there’s something serious
about dangerous dog, and prosecute
people who own such animals, then we
might see this trend turn around,” said
Dr. Andrew Rowan at Tufts .

In Santa Clara County last month, a 2-
year-old boy was killed by a pit bull.
Since. then, close to 40 of the animals
have been brought in to the Humane So-
ciety shelter to be destroyed. “It’s been
very difﬁcult for the staff here,” says
Kathy Snow. The dogs “appear to be fam-
ily pets that show no sign of aggression.”

The ones that aren’t being destroyed
are the meanest. They’re being bred and
turned into killer dogs — and experts say
there will be even more attacks

Last month at the District of Columbia
Animal Shelter, a couple with two daugh-
ters came in seeking shots for a brown
and white puppy that sat quietly at their
feet. But when the girls started playing
with it, the dog rushed at them, snarling

Shelter manager Wilhelmina Swenholt
told the woman, “ ‘Ma’am, if you love
your children, you’d better do something
about that, dog You’re not going to have
them very long’

“I’ve never seen it with a dog that
young They didn’t teach that; it’s been
bred in him. It was pure aggression.”

Dallas’ celebrity primate
learning to ape gorillas 9

By Scott Sunde
OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

Kanda, the Dallas gorilla that
played like a human child,‘
walked like a man and bested
sportswriters at their own game,
has become a star pupil at a pri-
mate school in Colorado.

The lowland gorilla was raised
by‘ humans at the Dallas Zoo,
learning to monkey around to
please people but little about be-
ing an ape. So in January he was
sent to the Cheyenne Mountain
Zoo in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
for gorilla lessons.

Six months later, Kanda, who
will be 5,in September, is passing

with ﬂying colors, ofﬁcials at the
Colorado zoo said.

“He caught on very quickly,”
said Karen Murray, the zoofs
marketing and development di-.
rector. “He has shifted his need

. for human attention to attention

from other gorillas.” ,

However, Kanda’s apprentice-
ship has just begun, and the most
important lessons —— those about
the birds, bees and gorillas —— are

yet to be learned. Zoo ofﬁcials;

hope the animal, part of an my

dangered species, ultimately will A

learn enough to breed.

he knows he is a gorilla, then we
can send him to another zoologi-
cal institution to breed,” said
Gerry Brady, general curator of
the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo.

After 30 days in quarantine,
Kanda began his training by be—
ing housed next door to Juju, his
older sister. After the siblings got
to know each other, Juju and
Kanda moved into the same ex-
hibit, then were joined by a sec-
ond female, Roxie.

Kanda’s ﬁrst big exam came in
late May when Lash, a dominant
male that has just reached sexual
maturity, moved in.

“There was no confrontation.
Kanda was too young and abso-
lutely accepted Lash’s domi-
nance,” Murray said.

It’s almost as if Kanda had
heard the tired joke about where
a 500-pound gorilla sleeps. “He
has already learned very quickly
you give that big guy a lot of
room,” said Bill Aston, vice pres-
ident of the Dallas Zoological So-

,ciety, who saw Kanda in early

July.

Teaching Kanda». has been
painstaking work, and much of it

involved taking the human eleg , ‘

ment out of his life.

In the beginning in Colorado,
he craved human attention, ex-
hibiting his pleas by patting his
head and reaching out with his
arms. What’s more, he walked
erect, not bent over like most go-
rillas.

The 200, however, has limited
human contact.

. There were also plenty of re-

quests from outside the 200 for
Kanda to repeat the trick that
made him famous: picking the
winners of professional football
games. In 1983, the gorilla’s luck
in sports prognostication won
him several appearances on na-
tional television.

But Brady remained ﬁrm:
Kanda’s touting days were over.

Today, Kanda is walking more
like a gorilla and exhibiting their
communication and grooming
tendencies, Brady said.

Yet he remains torn between
the gorilla contact in which he
has been immersed and the hu-
man contact with which he. grew
up, Brady said.

“He still looks a little bit like a
kid who isn’t quite sure he ﬁts
in,” Aston said.

Facing threats'of tough animal-

DeKalb~based group is attempting
to organize a statewide Georgia
Coalition of Dog Clubs.

The forming of the coalition.

comes after some DeKalb County
officials unsuccessfully attempted

to ban dangerous breeds of dogs-

after a Stone Mountain woman was
‘mauled by a neighbor’s pit bull
terrier July 15.

The woman, Mary Merelino, 71, Of

5040- Antebellum Drive, received
about 100 stitches atDeKalb Gen-
eral Hospital after the pit bull
knocked her down and bit her legs,
throat and torso. ‘ , , ,
The coalition —- which held. an
. organizational meeting last Thurs—
day with representatives of dog
clubs from across the metro Atlanta
area — plans to lobby for “just”
animal-control ordinances and act
as an information network for dog-
related organizations, according to
Linda North, chairman of the
group’s steering committee.
“We’re not teachers, but we’d be
able to point people to the right
organizations,” Ms. North said.
The steering committee has
worked closely with organizations
such as the American Kennel Club,
the American Dog Owners Associa-
tion and similar coalitions in other
states.

iﬂee Considers ‘

Statewide Vicious Dog Law

By VIVIAN PRICE

Considering the vocal crowds
that have attended local sessions,
there was a surprising lack of
public interest in the ﬁrst meeting
last week of a legislative commit-
tee studying the vicious dog prob
lem.

Members of the state House Vi-
cious Dog Subcommittee of the
Game, Fish and Recreation Com.
mittee is charged with holding
public hearings and making recom-
mendations to the 1988 session of
the General Assembly on state-
wide legislation addressing the vi-
cious dog issue.

Committee members agreed on a
couple of points, requested some
information from staffers and ad-
journed after meeting for only a
few minutes.

Legislation, they agreed, cannot
be breed-speciﬁc, and the wording
of the bill will be crucial.

“You can’t have a bill drawn
over a breed or two breeds,” said
chairman Rep. Howard Rainey (D-
Cordele). “You have to do it by
characteristics.”

“The language will be impor-
tant,” said member Rep. J. B.
Langford (D-Calhoun), “whether
you regulate the dog as. a pit bull
or a Staffordshire terrier or a hy-
bridization.”

Members agreed that the prob-
lem of stray dogs will not be
addressed. “You have got to ﬁnd
the owner before you can penalize
anybody,” Rainey said.

Langford (D-Calhoun) wants the
committee to see statistics on in-
dictments and convictions of dog
owners. Rainey (D-Cordele) wants
to hear from dog breeders who
might have raised pit bulls and
other dogs side by side, to get an
idea of whether the problem lies
with the breed or the training.

Rainey said that dates, times
and places of additional public
hearings in the Atlanta will, be
announced later.

Vicious dogs, said Rainey, are
primarily an urban problem, be-
cause of concentrations of people.
“Sometimes a person doesn’t have
a place to conﬁne the dog. .They
don’t have the knowledge or the
training to handle the dog. They
are being kept in houses, apart-

ments and poor fencing.”

After the meeting, south DeKalb

state Rep. Frank Redding (D-50),
. who is not a member of the com-
' mittee, agreed with Rainey. Red-
ding emphasized the disparities
; between rural and urban dog own-
, ership and hinted that any compro-

% mise on legislation might be difﬁ-
cult.

“Those kinds of things are

~ usually ruled by the rural areas,”
- Redding said. “In this state you

are not going to prohibit a dog in a

. rural area laying under a tree that 3
. will bite you if you get out of the
car. ’ - ..

’

. .0“. _.. cm... _. ”tug-m...“ -. . .

<
. . . .v.‘_m-——-._.mma..4'

Redding said he feels the com-
mittee’s primary goal is to head off
potential constitutional challenges
to recently-adopted local ordi-
nances around the state that pro—
hibit speciﬁc breeds of dogs.

The committee may well use
DeKalb’s new vicious dog ordi-
nance which, he said, “is the best
ordinance anywhere.”

Committee member Rep. Max
Davis (R45) said he doesn’t know
if an effective law is possible.
Davis, who was a member of the
committee that developed the
state’s statutes on ﬁghting dogs,
said the panel’s most difficult task
will be to deﬁne a Vicious dog. “If a
person comes up to a fence and a
dog is growling and barking, is
that vicious?” he asked.

Other members of the state com-.
mittee on vicious dogs are state ‘
Reps. Charlie Watts (D-Dallas),
Ralph Twiggs (D-Hiawassee),
Lundsford Moody (D-Baxley) and

' Ed Holcomb (D-Jonesboro).

 




 

FT. LAUDERDALE SUN-SENTINEL - August 4, 1987

~ Hillsboro Beach predators
alarming conservationists

 

By LARRY BERNARD

Science Writer

HILLSBORO BEACH -— Gray foxes

have attacked a record number of sea tur-
tle eggs and hatchlings on Hillsboro Beach
this season, prompting turtle conservation-
ists to sound an alarm.

“We’ve just got to get this thing under,

control. It’s very serious,” said Sherwood
“Woody” Wilkes of the Discovery Center in
Fort Lauderdale, which runs the county’s
turtle conservation‘program. _

- The foxes, estimated to number 35 to 40,
live in the vegetated dunes of this coastal
town and dine nightly on the young or em-
bryonic loggerhead, leatherback and green
sea turtles, all protected by federal law.

. Conservationists have received permis-

' sion to trap up to 10 of the small foxes to
relocate them.

The foxes have attacked or disturbed 60
. to 70 nests this turtle nesting season on the
2.5-mile stretch of beach, Wilkes said. Nor-
mally, only five. or six nests would be at-
tacked in a- season. There are about 400
nests on the beach.

- ' “The first 28 of 30 nests that hatched,
x they got all of them. . . . It’s an incredible
, amount,” Wilkes said.

Lou Fisher, who is on the county’s en-

vironmental staff that oversees the turtle"-

program, said it is common for foxes to be

attracted to turtle eggs. .

“Foxes have been living there for years.
But this happens to be the second year
we’ve seen some disturbance from them,”
Fisher said. “This year it’s a lot more. I

guess foxes are learning sea turtles are.

good to eat.” .
Nocturnal hunters, gray foxes normally
survive on mice and small rodents. But a

combination of factors probably has lead '

to overpOpulation, officials said. For. ex-

 

 

ample, the animals have become accus-
tomed to humans feeding them and have
thrived on handouts and refuse from gar-
bage cans.

Also, the success of the turtle program
means there are more turtle eggs. Since

. there is more prey, more foxes can .sur-
'vive, said Eddie White of the state DlVlSlon .

of Wildlife.
Removing 10 foxes, in an area where 35

to 40 animals live, “certainly would not to-

tally eliminate the disturbance of those
nests,” White said. . ' <
Town officials want the foxes left alone
but can tolerate the removal of a few of
them, Police Chief Ralph Dunn said. i‘:
“We haven’t had any problems at all of
them bothering people,” he said. “I’ve been
here 23 years, and they’ve been here at
least that long. If it causes a problem with

much pressure on him. He’s got
good food, a good environment
and someone who really cares
about him. All in all, he’s a hap-

In the ring, he’s more a teddy
than a terror. He is rarely the ag-
gressor, choosing instead to sit
patiently with no mobility and
use his size advantage to wear
down his foe like a furry Gerry

750 pounds and eventually holds
his opponent down until winning

ders “Leave it alone.”

Agencies approve
Yellowstone plan

_ By Lou Chapman
Denver Post Environment Writer .

Wolves moved a step closer toward getting
back into Yellowstone National Park this week.

The US. Fish and Wildlife Service approved
a plan supporting the reintroduction of the en-
dangered Rocky Mountain gray wolf into Yel-
lowstone and two other areas.

Officials of the Fish and Wildlife Service call-
ed the plan a “broad guiding document,” and
said it puts the reintroduction of the wolf in the
hands of other federal agencies.

“What this says is that if one of the appropri-

case the US. Forest Service or the National

the service would cooperate with them,” said
John Spinks, deputy regional director of the

. and social impacts of reintroducing wolves into
Yellowstone, which probably will be spear-
headed by the National Park Service.

Wildlife groups that support the reintroduc-
tion of wolves into Yellowstone and other areas
have pushed for the revision for years, claiming
the wolves were inhumanely removed from the
areas and that the wolves could benefit the nat-
ural balance of wildlife in the parks.

“From 1914 until 1926, the National Park Ser-
vice and other federal agencies eradicated all
the wolves they could find in Yellowstone be-

. cause they lacked the understanding of the role
they played there,” said Terry Martin, with the
National Parks and Conservation Association in

' Utah. “This is an understanding that the wolves
do play a role in the parks.” .

Ranchers in Wyoming and surrounding states
have vociferously opposed the plan, saying '
wolves would endanger their livestock. ..

LITTLE DUCKIES‘: F0 WL-UP
MURDER MOST Fowr.

 

A pond near PreSton Road and West-
grove Drive was once home to 22
ducks. But neighboring humans who
fawn over the fowls are almost frantic,
fretting over the six that are left.

Seems the creatures delighted in
crossing Westgrove to an unmowed lot
that offered delicacies aplenty. Little
did they realize they were sitting
ducks. M0tori5ts, caught unaware,
killed 16 of the wayward waddlers.
Eleven ducks, including a newly
hatched brood, died in a single inci-
dent. AnOther duck was hit, but sur-
vived, thanks to people who fed it for
two weeks.

Preston Trails resident Jeanine
Caldwell called the city of Dallas, re-
queSting installation of a “duck cross-
ing” sign. She-was told the city has no
such sign. When we called to confirm,
we spoke to Pete Naghavi, a traffic
engineer who ducked the issue. “We
believe we have more important things
to do,” he said.

Guess in Dallas, it’s tough luck for
ducks. — DR.

Seeping threat to Seal Sands swans

RADIOACTIVE sludge—2,500 tons
of it—has begun to ‘ weep ’ from
tanks at Seal Sands, a peaceful spot
on the bank of the Tees.

From a distance, few outward

signs of anything amiss are
apparent. But inside the chemical
works by the estuary, the condition
of three storage ponds of harmful
uranium-bearing effluent is

deteriorating with age. Most of the'

effluent has been there for a decade

' for

' and no new stocks have been added
for six years.

The tanks are open to the air and
silt has built up on the liquid’s
surface. Experts say this means a
danger that the blustery winds could
whip up a radioactive ‘ aerosol’.

Though only mildly radioactive,
the hazardous sludge composed of
depleted uranium, is also toxic. Ever
since, disposal has been a headache

successive owners of the

chemical plant, the latest being
Germany’s chemical giant BASF.
One plan was to pour the harmful
effluent into trenches on the river
banks. Then, naturally diluted by
rain fall, it would have been allowed
gradually to seep into the Tees.
But a Cleveland County Council
committee rejected this last month.
Officials were not impressed that
BASF felt the ‘ least-cost ’ method
was suitable for Teesside. Birdlife

in the area must already try to
survive in some of Britain’s most
heavily industrially-polluted waters.
A BASF spokesman last night said
his company was surprised the
council committee had rejected the
proposed plan to dispose of the
waste since this had been approved”. ., ..
by the Health and Safety Executive,
BASF, he said, might reapply. ‘

THE HOUSTON POST - August 3, 1987

nimal abuse is manifested in a variety of ways.
There are the obvious cases which generate
, considerable outrage from the public such as
if recent media reports which identified two area teen-
agers who set a prized English springer spaniel afire.
This cruel act resulted in the pet having to be hu-
manely destroyed.

As shocking as this incident may be, it’s not, un-

.‘ fortunately, an uncommon situation. Cruelty investi-

«gators from local animal welfare agencies are rou-

f tinely confronted with reports concerning kittens

gibeing burned in SS—gallon drums; live puppies and

. kittens thrown into trash dumpsters. Dogs and cats

" have been hanged, burned with acid, used for bow

_ and arrow practice or as “sacrificial lambs” to keep
fighting dogs aggressive. Other than the tortured ani-
mals, the major problem with these investigations is '
that, most often, those involved with reporting the
crime leave the scene, or will not step forward and
volunteer to be a witness in court. They tell us to “Do
something, send them to jail; get ’em off the streets,
but don’t use my name or involve me.”

Another form of animal abuse reported daily is
starvation. One or more starving animals will rarely
make the evening news so the public is. usually not
aware of this problem. Cruelty investigators from the
Houston SPCA and Associated Humane Societies are
on the road every day, investigating dogs on short
chains with little food or water (if any) and more of-
ten than not, no shelter; cats abandoned in empty
houses with no food or water; exotic birds being sold
on the rural highways without proper shelter; horses
in remote pastures without adequate food and water;
and sick or injured animals that have been neglected
by owners.

It’s absolutely amazing how many of these animal
abusers believe themselves to be good responsible
owners. They are usually quite perturbed that some-
one is accusing them of being irresponsible. “This is
the way we did it back on‘the farm,” they usually say.
Actually, more than 90 percent of all animal abuse is
directly related to ignorance of animal nutrition,
housing, medical care, ectoparasites, training, immu—
nizations, licensing, etc.

Another group who abuse animals without ever
considering the consequences are those who allow
their dogs/cats to roam freely, becoming neighbor—
hood nuisances Or letting the “old girl” have a litter ,

. once or twice a year because everyone loves puppies 2.
and kittens. These people believe all dogs and cats .

should be free to go anywhere and, that nature

meant for these animals to reproduce. They think
spaying or neutering are acts of cruelty. This attitude
has resulted in an enormous dog/ cat overpopulation
problem. More than 15 million dogs/cats are killed
each year in the United States simply because there
are too many. This figure doesn’t include the millions _
killed on the highways, die of starvation and disease, !
poisoned, or victims of predatory animals (including
humans). . .

Many readers will agree that animal abuse 15
wrong. However, they will quickly say child abuse . ‘
and other crimes are much more threatening tosoc1— =,
ety, so animal abuse should be low on the priority , ‘
list. My concern with this trend of thought is that it s

difficult to separate many of the crimes that occur in
society. in many situations, violent acts that begin
with animal abuse progress into human abuse. It’s
i well documented that people involved in serious
criminal activities also have had histories of animal
abuse. -
Remember the Boston Strangler, Albert DeSalvo?
As a boy, he enjoyed torturing animals. He starved a
dog nearly to death, then set it on a cat to watch the
fun. He shot animals with arrows just for pleasure.
TheSe were just few of his games. We don’t know all
of them because nobody seemed to notice. Yet even
DeSalvo’s own lawyer, F. Lee Bailey, said that if only
DeSalvo had had remedial attention when he was
committing these sadistic acts, the 13 women he lat—

er assaulted and killed may have beenispagdjﬂ
David Berkowitz, New York City’s “Son of Sam”
gunman and Charles Manson, the California cult

' leader, also practiced many of their mental aberra-
' tions on animals.

About a month ago, a story in The Magazine of
The Houston Post profiled "The meanest man on
death row” —— a man who as a teen-ager enjoyed
finding cats and dogs on the street and kiling them
by strangling or shooting them.

A recent study by Drs. Stephen Kellert of Yale Uni-
versity and Alan Felthous of the University of Texas
(Medical Branch) also reveals that the case—histories ~
of many aggressive criminals contain significant evi- -
dence of childhood animal abuse. These findings are »
a dramatic step forward in understanding the links
between various forms of violence. The role of do-
mestic violence among family members in the child-
hood of these aggressive criminals was exceptionally
high, and the range of cruelty to animals is graphic '
and profoundly disturbing. The research by these sci-
entists makes a compelling argument for humane
education for our children, and for early identification
of animal abusers as potential time bombs in our
midst. ..

It’s also interesting to note that in the 13th centu- I
ry, Thomas Aquinas wrote: “passages of Holy Writ
seem to forbid us to be cruel to dumb animals . . . lest
through being cruel to animals one becomes cruel to .
human beings.” "

Nearly 600 years later, we still do not recognize

:j the significance of animal abuse and its effects on so-

. ciety. Isn’t it about time to put it all together and real-,1
ize that animals are integral members of our total en- ~
’ vironment . . . to be loved and respected as we '

expect to be?

Pigeons Remember
Missing Objects

.An experiment by researchers at
Michigan State University suggests that
pigeons think in images and can distin-
gursh patterns in the movements of ob-
Jects. '

The researchers tested five birds

1 using a clock face displayed on a com-

a.

puter screen that had a sweeping sec-
ond hand but no numbers. In each 10-
second trial, the hand started at the 12
o’clock position and moved to the 3
o’clock position. The hand then disap- .

peared from the screen and in subs:
quent trials either irmnediately reaj
peared at 4 o’clock, delayed shortly i
reappearmg or reappeared at one (
three other positions on the clock.

. The pigeons were taught to discrin
mate among these possibilities an
would signal where they expected th
hand to reappear by pecking a corrc
sponding key. One of the researchen
Mark E. Rilling, a professor of psychol
ogy at the university, says this suggest
that the pigeons are forming a mentz
image of the clock and have some pro
cess by which they predict movemer
after the hand disappears.

In 64 trials, each bird correctly prr
dicted the delayed reappearances of th
hand and different “times” where th
hand reappeared about 80 percent of th
time, Rilling said.

He theorizes that pigeons and 0th:
animals use this thinking process in n2

Gentlemen:

I wonder why it is that the National Enquirer (thepaper everyone
likes to lambast for its sensationalism, and in many cases, lies),
seems to be the only paper reporting the waste of money by the
Federal government? Every week they tell of some tremendous waste
by some branch of our government - a waste every taxpayer is paying
for? .

The enclosed is nothing new to me - but it is the first time I have
seen it in print for a long time. Why are the cattlemen favored in
such a manner? Why should they be shown any favors by the taxpayer,
because after all, it is again the suffering taxpayer who feek the
effects of these ridiculously low grazing fees on_PUBLIC LANDS. I
would be willing to wager a goodly sum that the overwhelming number
of Americans would prefer that no cattle or sheep be allowed to graze
on PUBLIC LAND — land which these animals are 'ruining for everyone.
Enough research has been done by experts which prove without any
doubt, that it is the cattle and the sheep who despoil the land —
not the wild horses or other animals who belong there. If a rancher
has to pay a private landowner $6.53 a head to graze his cattle, why
is the government only charging $1.35? Please explain the sense of
this to me.

And when one reads that just 1800 cattlemen own almost 50% of the
cattle grazing on public lands, it makes one wonder how this small
number of ranchers can control the price of the grazing, which is
most likely what they are doing.

I think it's about time for Congress to wake up, and make these .
ranchers pay for using our land. If they can’t afford to, then let
them reduce their herds. Mere and more research is showing that
humans are much better off eating less red meat.

I would like your reaction on this, please.

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Connie Yarbrough

 




 

Taxpayers are losing a whop-~

the U.S. government charges fat
cat cattlemen cut-rate fees to
graze their livestock on public
lands.

 

Incredibly, the latest fig- $73 million to administer the
' grazmg program.

A recent study by the gov-
ernment found that the fair
market value of the grazing
rights -- the average price

ment collects $26 million a
year from cattlemen for graz-
ing rights on public lands,
but spends a mind-boggling

charges only $1.35 a head.

If the federal government
charged fair market value

for grazing rights, it would
bring in $101- million a year
-— $75 million more than it
gets now.

“An increase in the fees
would reduce the multimil-

 

 

lion-dollar drain on the pub-
lic treasury resulting from
a below-market fee, which
benefits only 2 percent of
American livestock produc-
ers,” said Rep. Mike Synar
(D.~Okla.).

Just 1,800 cattlemen own
almost 50 percent of the cat-
tle grazing on public lands,
records show.

And some of these cattle-
men are making a killing
by subleasing their grazing
rights for more than they
pay the federal government
for them, a recent study by
Colorado State University
found.

“We have no objection to
peeple grazing livestock on
public lands if they pay for
it. But they’re not paying for
it and it’s costing the taxpay-
ers money to subsidize these
folks,” said David Alber-
swerth, director of the Na-
tional Wildlife Federation’s
public land and energy divi-
sion.

“They’re fat cats and
they’re getting an incredible
break from the federal gov-

Gentlemen:

Please read carefully the enclosed re the gentleman who
used to be a government trapper.

It is difficult for someone who loves all living creatures to believe
that this man - and I am sure many others - would drag coy-

ote pups out of a (kni with a barbed wire, and bash their

heads in; set fires in_den mouths to suffocate the pups and

stayed there and listened to them howling in agony. I wonder

what kind of people we are raising in America. I pray I never

meet any such "human”. But to think that our government spon-

sors such actions is really horrifying and sickening.

It is just another case where the cattlemen and the sheepmen
seem to get their way in the destruction of our wildlife.
Yes, ”our" wildlife, and I vehemently protest anything like
this being allowed. I think all Americans have a say in the
destruction of their predators, but the only way we find out
about these conditions is thru the Humane Society of the

US, the American Humane Assn., or other animal organizations.

To allow the use of the poison 1080 once again is wrong, es—
pecially when research proved this not only killed the preda-
tory animal, but other innocent animals as well. Just who has
rights in this country - only the cattlemen, sheepmen and
farmers?" Looks like Mr. Randall's last paragraph tells it
like it is, doesn't it?

Please lt me hear from you on this. It should give you all
good reason to prohibit the use of the steel, leghold trap
by the government or by anyone else.

Sincerely,

HOUSTON POST - August 2, 1987

Government trapper becomes.

In 10 years as a government trapper,
.Dick Randall killed about 4,000 coyotes,
hundreds of bobcats and scores of black
bears with traps and guns. As a friend has
remarked, only God knows how many
hundreds more animals died from the poi-
son Randall spread.

Randall has dragged coyote pups out of a
den with a barbed wire yoke and bashed
their heads in. He has set fires in den

2, mouths to suffocate the pups and listened
to them yowl as they burned alive trying to

In 1974, a disgusted Randall quit his job

«with the US. Fish and Wildlife Service and
. ,took a step that made some former friends
. call him “traitor." He became a field repre-

' sentative of the Defenders of Wildlife, an

:. environmental group.

In recent years, he has been an eloquent

. and tireless crusader for wildlife and

. against Compound 1080 poison and other

_ inhuman methods of predator control. Atnd
. he is one crusader that predator-cussing

_ -...‘

ranchers can’t brush off as just another
know-nothing “bleeding heart” from the
East.

His name pops up frequently in environ-
mental reports and as a hearing witness,
briefly but intriguingly identified as a “for—
mer government trapper.”

Now, Defenders of Wildlife magazine
has finally satisfied our curiosity by run-
ning a full-length word portrait of this quite
remarkable man. -

Richard Leroy Randall was born in 1924
in the little Wyoming town of Powell, the
son of a service station owner and a music
teacher. As a youngster, he kept rabbits as
pets and learned to shoot deer, antelope
and other game.

Growing into adulthood, he was a
sheepherder, cowboy and horse wrangler,
machinery repairman, Yucatan explorer,
photography student and line rider.

For five winters, he rode a 70-mile Wyo—
ming- gas pipeline on horseback, through
snow and 40—below weather, checking for
leaks. The job’s perks included line shacks

and the county's only heated privy —— fu- .
eled by gas bled off the pipeline.

On the winter rides, Randall broke the
monotony by observing the animals and
trapping a few for extra income. A Fish and
Wildlife Service agent, impressed with his
wildlife savvy, suggested that Randall be-
come agovemment trapper.

So he slaughtered coyote pups in their
dens. He spread the highly lethal 1080 far
and wide, but worried some about the non—
target animals it killed. .

The wildlife service had a machine that .
turned’but strychnine—laced balls of tallow,
400 of them a minute. And Randall used to

Crusader for wildlife,"

‘ “lean out the airplane window and throw

2 baits over the countryside by the coffee—
- canful.”

- Initially, Randall felt he was a conserva-
tionist, dorng the ranchers and his country
a real servrce. But that picture of himself
began to blur badly.

For one thing, he soon discerned that
many ranchers had high predator losses
because “they were just plain lousy man-
agers. For another, Randall hated to set a
line of steel traps, then be ordered onto
another job so he couldn’t get back to any
trapped animals for a week.

Once, checking traps with his son Andy -

along, Randall found a big male bobcat that
had been in the steel jaws for days. The cat
took a leap at them, fell down and died.

Finally, Randall began to admire the w'ay

avord poxsoned bait and other traps. He felt
the coyotes were “showing so much more
intelligence than we were." i

.“Some coyotes,” he said, “had taken :to
urinating on our cyanide guns —— just to let
us know what they thought, I figured.” -

Now, the once-banned denning is again
an approved control policy, and 1080 has
been returned to limited use. .

One theory advanced to account for the
breed 's unusually stable and congenial—
to-people disposition is that he is far too
formidable a beast for it to be prudent to
allow vicious individuals to survive (and
thus to propagate). . . . This selective pro-
cess tended to weed out the mean dogs
and has left us with a dog with an almost

The mean ones are the aberrations still.
But the aberrations are more numerous.

—--RICHARD F. STRATTON

July 8, 1987

MERICA HAS A FOUR-LEGGED
problem called the American
, pit bull terrier. And the pit bull,
its “ridiculously amiable dispo—
sition” notwithstanding, has a two-
legged problem called Man, to whom
Stratton’s second quote could also be ap-
plied. These two species are not new to
each other. They have intermingled for
some 200 years, and some say their com—
mon history goes back as far as the R0-
mans. But something has happened to
the pit bull in the last decade that says as
much about the nature of American so-
ciety as it does about the nature of this
aggressive animal. Far from being an
aberration, the American pit bull terrier
has become a reﬂection of ourselves that
no one cares very much to see.

“They’re athletes. They’re wrestlers.
They’re dead game,” says Captain Ar—
thur Haggerty, a dog breeder and train
er in New York City who owns ﬁve pit
bull terriers and has trained hundreds of

others. “They will literally ﬁght till
they’re dead. If you found that quality in
a boxer or a football player, you’d say it
was admirable. Will to win. That’s what
a pit bull has.” . ..
Others call it a “will to kill.” At least
35 communities nationwide have con-
sidered banning the breed from within
their city limits, and while such ordi-
nances have run into constitutional
problems stemming from the difﬁculty
in deﬁning exactly what a pit bull terrier

is, their number is growing weekly. The

horror stories involving pit‘bulls are vo-
luminous. Recent tragedies include the
death of two—year-old James Soto, who
was mauled in Morgan Hill, Ca1if.,-on
June 13 by a neighbor’s pit bull. The at—
tack rendered the child “unrecognizable
as a human being,” according to para-
medics. Nine days later a national tele-
vision audience watching the evening
news was treated to the terrifying spec-
tacle of a pit bull terrier attacking Los
Angeles animal control ofﬁcer Florence
Crowell. The 33-year-old woman sur-
vived but spent ﬁve days in the hospital.

On April 6, a retired surgeon, 67-
year-old William Eckman, was killed by
two pit bulls on a street in Dayton, Ohio
On that same day, 16-month—old Melis-
sa Larabee of Jones, Okla, was killed by
the family’s pet pit bull, who bit her in
the throat. In June 1986, 20—month-old
Kyle Corullo was attacked by a pit bull
in Ramsay, Mich, while playing in
his grandmother’s backyard. The dog,
ﬁghting off the child’s mother, dragged
the boy into a nearby lot and shook him
to death “like a stuffed animal.”

In the last 18 months, 12 of the 18
conﬁrmed dog-related fatalities in the

 

 

 

 




U.S.—or 67%—have been caused by the
pit bull terrier, a breed that accounts for
only 1% of the US. dog population. And
the mairnings are far more numerous.
Often it is small children who are the
victims of unprovoked attacks. There is
no deﬁnitive source for animal attack
statistics, but pit bull fanciers claim that
statistics show other breeds of dog bite
more frequently—German shepherds
lead the list—and accuse the media of
publicizing only pit bull maulings. DOG
BITES MAN isn’t news, they say, but PIT
BULL BITES MAN is.

Unfortunately the pit bull, when it
attacks, doesn’t” merely bite man—or,
most horribly, child—it clamps its pow-
erful jaws down and literally tears its
victim apart. “The injuries these dogs
inﬂict are more serious than other
breeds because they go for the deep mus-
culature and don’t release; they hold and
shake,” says Sheryl Blair of the Tufts
Veterinary School, in North Grafton,
Mass, which last year held a symposium
entitled Animal Agression: Dog Bites
and the Pit Bull Terrier. .

“Most breeds do not multiple—bite,”
says Kurt Lapham, a ﬁeld investigator
for the West Coast Regional ofﬁce of the
Humane Society. “A pit bull attack is
like a shark attack: He keeps coming
back.” 7

“A pit bull,” says Judge Victor E.
Bianchini of San Diego, “is the fclosest
thing to a wild animal there is in a do-
mesticated dog.”

A fair assessment of a growing prob-
lem? Or a bad rap against an animal
which has suﬂered far more at the hands
of man than it can possibly repay? It has
been estimated that there are half a mil-

 

lion pit bull terriers alive in the United
States today. What about the 99% who
have never bitten a human being? Are
these dogs “loaded handguns,” as many
have called them? “There’s something a
little scary about Wondering, Is there a
time bomb ticking in my dog?” says Dr.
Franklin Loew, dean of Tufts Veteri-
nary School, who opposes eﬂ‘orts to leg—
islate against pit bull terriers and be-
lieves the breed is the victim of “canine
racism.” Loew adds, “The pit bull does
seem to respond more than other dogs to
people trying to bring out aggressive-
ness. But everything I know profession-
ally tells me that this is not a dog prob-
lem, but a problem of dog ownership.”
What exactly is a pit bull? Deﬁning it
has proved to be a formidable legal hur-
dle because the pit bull is not a speciﬁc
breed. Rather, it is a kind of dog, a ge-
neric catchall like hound or retriever.
The breeds most commonly referred to
as pit bulls are the American Staﬂ'ord-
shire terrier, which is the term used by
the American Kennel Club, and the
American pit bull terrier, the term used
by the United Kennel Club. The men
who match pit bulls in ﬁghts today do

not bother with such formalities; they .

refer to their animals as bulldogs—a
nickname which should not confuse pit
bulls with the pug-faced and bowlegged
English bulldog, a distant relative, or the
bullterrier, another relation whose
bloodline was softened long ago by
crossbreeding with the English Terrier.
Pit bulls come in ahnost any color; their
ears may be cropped or uncropped; their
noses either red or black; and their
height and weight merely proportion-
ate—with the weight parameters rang-

thought to trace their ancestry back to
the bull-and-terrier, which was devel-
oped in England in the early 19th centu-
ry. The bull-and-terrier was a cross be-
tween the early bull-dog—the name
comes from the fact that it was used in
bull-baiting—and a game terrier of
some kind, either English, or fox, or
black-and-tan. The bull—and-terrier dog
was also used for bull-baiting, and was
sometimes referred to as a butcher’s dog.
When a butcher wanted to slaughter one
of his cattle, he would sic his bull-and-
terrier on the unlucky bovine, and the
game little dog would latch onto the big—
ger animal’s nose, and the butcher, ham-
mer in hand, would move in swiftly and
bitidgeon the cow on the head.

At some point, no one is sure exact-
ly when, gentlemen sportsmen began
matching bull—and-terrier dogs against
each other. One of the more popular es—
tablishments in London used for such
purposes was the Westminster Pit, an
enclosure that could hold about 300
spectators. Admission was charged at
the door (two shillings in 1816), odds
would be established, wagers were made
and purses put up. It was all very civi-
lized. Sometimes, after the dogs had ﬁn-
ished chewing up one another, a ﬁght
between bears would follow.

In 1835, the English parliament out-

lawed the whole bloody business—bear?

baiting, bull-baiting and dogﬁghting.
All the law served to do was to drive
dogﬁghting underground. The coal min-
ers in Staﬂ'ordshire were said to be par—
ticularly avid followers of the clandes-
tine “sport.” Now, more than 150 years
later, in an age of computers and bioge-
netics, the blood of those miners courses
through the veins of citizens in these 50
states, and the blood of the bull-and-ter-

riersdog’s descendants continues to be
splattered against the sides of pits.

According to The Complete Dog Book,
the ofﬁcial AKC publication, the pit bull
ﬁrst came to America around 1870.
Some pit bull breeders date their arrival
much earlier. Byron Fortenberry of Ak-
ron, Ohio, a breeder and author on ca-
nine subjects, claims that of the two dogs
that came over on the Mayﬂower, one
was a spaniel and one was “a small mas-
tiﬁ.” Says Fortenberry, “A bulldog was
called a small mastiﬂ‘ in 1620. No way
you can prove it was or it wasn’t a pit
bull, but more than likely that’s what be—
came our breed.”

Fortenberry does not explain how
this particular small mastiﬂ~ was able to
reproduce itself—perish the thought
that it was bred to the lowly spaniel——
but one of the traits one discovers in
talking with breeders of American pit
bull terriers is that they consider the dog
capable of almost anything, including
virgin birth. At any rate, the breed was
well established in America by the 20th
century. In 1898 the United Kennel
Club began registering American pit
bull terriers under the auspices of OZ.
Bennett, who drew up breed standards
and wrote a set of rules governing dog-
ﬁghting. In 1909 the American Dog
Breeders Association, which at that time
was determined to distance itself from
dogﬁghting, set up its own registry.

These were the salad days of the pit
bull terrier. The dog was the envy of the
canine world. Buster Brown’s ﬂoppy-
eared pal in the popular comic strip of
that era was his pit bull, Tige. Theodore
Roosevelt had a pit bull in the White
House. And a pit bull named Stubby,
used in World War I to deliver messages
between battalions, assisted in the cap-
ture of a German spy and was decorated
for bravery by General John (Black
Jack) Pershing. _

The pit bull was America’s dog and
was depicted as such in 1914 by artist
Wallace Robinson, who created a poster
in which an English bulldog, a German
dachshund, an American bull terrier, a
French bulldog and a Russian wolf-
hound were dressed in the military uni-
forms of each dog’s country. The caption
on the poster was a remark by the pit
bull, who appeared in the middle, slight-
ly larger than the rest: “I’m neutral,
BUT—Not Afraid of any of them.”

Later, the most famous pit bull of
them all burst on the American scene, a
star who was, ironically it now seems,
surrounded by a cast of children. That
was the Our Gang canine pal, Pete, a
predominately white pit bull with a
distinctive black circle—almost certain-
ly the work of a make-up artist—
around its left eye. Pete is celluloid proof

Why don’t you come see us in Tennessee sometime. The hills are lovely about now.

THERE’S SOMETHING SPECIAL about the
Tennessee hills as a place for making Jack Daniel ’5.

You see, we make an old/fashioned whiskey that
can’t be hurried in any manner. And out here,
where the pace of city living is all but

forgorten, a man can slow down and

do things right. We could probably

make a bit more Jack Daniel’s if we

made it in a factory. (Make it faster,

probably, too.) But after a sip we

think you’ll agree: there’s something

special about whiskey that comes

from the hills.

that there was a time when the pit bull
terrier had “a ridiculously amiable
disposition.”

In 1935 the American Kennel Club
ﬁnally decided to recognize the Ameri-
can pit bull terrier as a breed The club,
however, could not bring itself to call the
animal by that name. The AKC wanted
its own name for this courageous, per—
sonable dog, and it wanted a name that
did not include the word pit. The AKC
settled upon the Staﬁordshire terrier be-
cause so many of the dogs had come
from that area of England. In the
summer of 1936 the ﬁrst Stafford-
shire ierrier was registered by the
AKC. Pit bull lore has it that Pete
was the ﬁrst Staﬁ‘ordshire. It’s a
swell story, but not true. Pete was
among the ﬁrst, but the honor
actually, goes to a dog named
Wheeler’s Black Dinah.

“It was exactly the same dog as
our American pit bull terrier,”
says Andy Johnson of the rival
UKC, which currently registers
between 25,000 and 30,000 Amer-
ican pit bull terriers annually
“They even opened their registry
to our dogs. The AKC just didn’t
want anything in their name that
would remind people of the ﬁght-
ing history of the pit bull. It was
likea. family denying that it had
horse tieves in its past.”

Pe1 , am. But most pit bull fan-
ciers believe that in the 52 years
since the Staffordshire terrier—
renamed the American Stafford-
shire terrier in 1972—was recog-
nized by the AKC, it has become
a dog signiﬁcantly different from
the UKC’s American pit bull ter-
rier. Not in looks—which are

ﬁght to its own death. American Staf-
fordshire terriers have not been valued
as ﬁghting dogs for at least half a centu-
ry. “A true Staffordshire terrier is not a
ﬁghting dog, even though it came from
a ﬁghting dog,” says the Humane Soci-
ety’ s Lapham.

Is it just coincidence, then, that none
of the killings of people in the past two
years have been attributed to registered
American Staﬁ’ordshire ' terriers? Proba-
bly not. .

“The American Staﬁ‘ordshire terri-

.~ a

president of the American Pit Bull Ter-
rier Club of'New England, feels the
same way about the dogs that she has
bred. “They say pit bulls have natural
aggressiveness,” she says. “I don’t be-
lieve it. People who are breeding for ag—
gressiveness will get it. For the last 12
years I haven’t been, and these dogs
aren’t. My dogs are babies. They’ll lick
you to death. The people who ﬁght dogs
tell me I’m ruining the breed They say

. my dogs are wimps.”

Sadly it is the responsible owners
and breeders who "are suffering
the most from the recent wave of
pit bull hysteria. “You feel "like
a criminal walking your dog,”
says Bazelak. “You’re constantly
approached by someone who says,
‘That’s a vicious dog,’ as if it’s a
wild animal. I’ve stopped breed—
ing mine. I don’t want to add to
the population right now. I’m dis-
gusted with the American people
who believe the problem’s with
the dog and not with the people
raising the dog.”

But the hysteria, or concern, is
understandable. To the untrained
eye—or even to the trained one, in
many instanceSAit is virtually
impossible to tell a docile pit bull
from a mean one. None of them
looks like a wimp, and a friendly
pit bull jumping up to lick you to
death has an eerie resemblance to
a pit bull jumping up to rip out
your throat. Your best bet is to
pass a fast judgment on its owner.

Pit bulls do not usually growl
before attacking; they seldom
bark. The hair on their backs does

ment. Why? Because over the
years the Staﬂ‘ordshire has been bred to
show, rather than to ﬁght. In one of his
books, pit bull expert and breeder Rich—
ard Stratton addressed this subject in his
glossary of pit bull terms: “American
Staffordshire terrier. . . . The show
counterpart of the APBT. Except for
some game strains that are dual- -regis-
tered, these dogs could not be expected
to be as game as the APBT or to have
the same ability.”

The ability Stratton is talking about is
the ability to ﬁght. The gameness he de-
scribes is the willingness of the animal to

er’s chief requisites should be strength
unusual for its size, soundness, balance,
'a strong, powerful head, a well-muscled
body, and courage that is proverbial,”
reads The Complete Dog Book. “As to
character, they exceed being dead
game; nevertheless, they should not be
held in ill repute merely because man
has been taking advantage of this rare
courage to use them in the pit as gam-
bling tools. These dogs are docile, and
with a little training are even tractable
around other dogs.”

bull, when so trained, is all busi-
ness, which has made it the dog of
choice for drug dealers and street punks
around the country. “People whose inse-
curities are such that they need macho
reinforcement feel a need for this type of
animal,” says Loew of Tufts, “and they
are available because of the overﬂow
from illegal dogﬁghts.” ,
“I just saw a surprising statistic from
a Los Angeles study,” Steve Blackwood,
a sergeant in the San Diego Sheriff’s De-
partment, said recently. “In two out of
three narcotics raids, pit bulls were used
as the guard dogs.”

San Diego investigators also were told
that local members of motorcycle gangs
were stashing their drugs beneath the
doghouses of their pit bulls. “Street dope
dealers and street gangs have gone to pit
bulls,” says Budd Johnson, an inspector
for the US. Marshals Service who is
based in San Diego. Law enforcement
oﬂicials are seeing the same thing all
over the country, and the pit bull popu-
lations in urban areas have mush-
roomed as a result. There have also been
instances when pit bulls were used in
armed robberies, in effect taking the
place of a weapon, and one case in
which a 16-year-old girl was raped by a
man who allegedly threatened her with
his two pit bulls.

“You’ve got a bunch of kooks out
there who are getting these dogs and
making them mean and registering
them,” says Andy Johnson of the UKC.
“Every time somebody writes how mean
these dogs are, the demand for them
jumps up. You can make any dog mean
if you work at it.”

Now, and historically, at the core of
the breed’s problems is dogﬁghting. This
loathsome “sport” is, by most accounts,-
more widespread than ever in the US.
At the same time it is even less humane,
having passed from the hands of the old—
time “gentlemen” breeders into the
mitts of the borderline sadists. Once pri-
marily a rural dementia, dogﬁghting has
become a city problem as well, the out-
growth of the popularity of pit bulls. It
matters little that dogﬁghting is illegal
in every state, and a felony-level crime
in 36 states. “You can virtually ﬁnd a
convention [as dogﬁghts are called in
the jargon of the sport] on any weekend
in any of the 50 states,” says Eric Sakach
of the West Coast Regional Ofﬁce of the
Humane Society in Sacramento.

“There are probably more matches
taking place today than ever before be-
cause of the popularity of the breed,”
says Stratton, whose books on pit bull
terriers include such chapters of general
interest as: “Dimensions of the Dog Pit”

and “Fluid Therapy for Treating Hypo-
Volemic Shock.”

“Dogﬁghting is the greatest per-ver-
sion of the special relationship that ex-
ists between people and dogs,” says
Randall Lockwood of the Humane Soci-
ety. “It is people subjecting dogs to in-
credible cruelty. And now that has
turned into dogs killing people.”

Dogﬁghters vehemently dispute this,
and with a straight face one writer com-
pared pitting a bulldog with taking a
greyhound out on a run. When, as a
youth, Stratton asked Mrs. William J.
Lightner, the wife of a legendary pit bull
breeder, if dogﬁghting was cruel, he re-

calls that she responded, “It was cruel
all right, but not to the dogs, for ﬁghting
was the very breath of life to them be-
cause of their breeding. But it was cruel
to the people because it was hard not to
get especially attached to your best dog,
the very one likely to be matched, and
sometimes they were lost.”

The dog, in the warped perspective of
the dogﬁghting zealot, dies happy, ful-
ﬁlled, like an Iranian soldier. Next stop,
puppy heaven. As one pitman bragged
to Benno Kroll, who wrote a superb ac-
count of dogﬁghting in the November
1979 issue of Ggo: “My dogs die with
their tails up and wagging.”

 

Perhaps. They also die with their legs
broken, their ears mangled and their
ﬂesh torn. “We’ve seen them, with both
front legs broken, push themselves
across the ring to ﬁght,” says Black-
wood, the San Diego sheriff.

Many times the dogs die hours after
the ﬁght of hypovolemic shock—dehy-
dration—since the prevailing wisdom
says to dehydrate your animal before
ﬁghting him to cut down on his potential
loss of blood. And sometimes a dog dies
minutes after the ﬁght from a bullet to
the brain, if the dog happens to “cur
out”—refuse to engage in battle.

Of course they don’t all die. Pit bulls

 

are incredibly hardy animals that, some
folks would have you beIieve, are imper-
vious to pain. The majority of the pit
bulls recover from their ﬁghts, which
routinely last more than an hour and
sometimes as long as three hours, and
live to ﬁght again.

Before each match, the handlers wash
their opponent’s pit bull, a tradition
which started after some “gentleman
sportsman” discovered that by putting
poison on his own dog’s coat, he could .
paralyze his adversary’s animal. When
the ﬁght begins, the two dogs share the
l6-foot-square pit with two handlers
and a referee. It’s close quarters in there,

no place for a man-eating dog. And the
bloodthirsty spectators, with ﬁstfuls of
cash, are separated from the partici-
pants by only a 30-inch-high wall. -'

“In the old days the ﬁghting dogs
were people-gentle,” says Lockwood.
“But that’s not true any longer. It’s not
unheard of now for dogs to come out of
the pit and attack spectators. Some of
our investigators have seen it.”

It has become a new game. It’s com-

monplace these days for a dogﬁghting

raid to turn up a veritable storeroom of
illegal weapons and illegal drugs. “Peo-
ple who think they are dogﬁghters are
into it now, but they have no concept
what it’s about,” says one pit bull breed—
er from Ohio. “True dogﬁghters had a
lot of money tied up in their dogs, and
they didn’t want to lose them. Today
these clowns steal somebody’s pet and
put him in the pit without training him.
Then they watch while the dog gets torn
up. At best, they’re sadistic.”

Training a ﬁghting pit bull terrier is
something the Marquis de Sade certain—
1y would have appreciated. Treadmills
are the most commonly used apparatus-
es, and sometimes a kitten or a chicken
is hung in a mesh basket at the top of the
treadmill to hold the dog’s attention. At
the end of the hours-long workout, guess
what the reward is? To increase the
dog’s biting power, trainers will hang
tires from tree limbs, bidding their pit
bulls to leap up and latch on, sometimes
making them hang there for 15 to 20
minutes.

Those are the sophisticated methods.
“In Toledo we arrested a guy who was
paying kids to collect cats for him,” re-
lates Lapham of the Humane Society.
“He’d throw them into the basement
where he kept his pit bull, to let him
taste blood.”

Steven Creighton, a sergeant with the
San Diego police department, recounts
the gruesome tale of the arrest on Dec. 4,
1986, of 18-year-old James Madison.
“We got a call that a guy put a noose
around a live cat’s neck and threw it
over a‘branch so that it hung about eight
feet oﬁ the ground,” says Creighton.
“Then the guy let a pit bull loose who at-
tacked the cat while [a group of neigh—
borhood children] watched in horror.

He would let the pit chomp on the cat
for a while, and then he’d lift the cat
up out of the pit’s reach. The dog was go—
ing crazy.” The cat eventually died.
Madison, who has pleaded not guilty,
will go on trial next month for felony
cruelty to animals and raising a do; 252‘
ﬁghting.

“It’s ridiculous,” says Stratton. “The
taste of blood doesn’t make a pit bull a
better ﬁghter. But people write that kind
of stuff about people who train pit bulls,
and these kids read it and it becomes a
self-fulﬁlling prophecy.”

And in some instances, it is literally
the kids who get involved. Last year in
Philadelphia ﬁve boys between the ages
of 11 and 14 were arrested and charged
with participation in a dogﬁghting ring
in which the losing dogs were thrown
out the window and hanged. All ﬁve
were found guilty. “They call it. ‘gam—
bling the dog,’ ” Sam McClain, a police
ofﬁcer with Philadelphia’s 19th District,
told reporters. In a follow~'up article on
Philadelphia street dogﬁghting, which
appeared in the July 2 issue of Rolling
Stone, writer Mike Sager described the
training regimen of a pair of pit bull
handlers, brothers aged 13 and 14:
“They’ll starve him to make him mean,
fatten 1‘1 on twenty-frve~cent~a—can
dog food and leftover beans and r‘iCe, run
him around the block behind their bicy-
cles, feed him chicken blood, take him
on a safari around the neighborhood
looking for cats and strays, shoot him up
with black-market penicillin and vita-
min B12 to help heal his wounds, and
rub him with used motor oil to make his
fur grow back over his scars.”

Some feed their dogs hot sauce to
make them mean, while others sub-
scribe to a dosage of gunpowder. It is not
clear whether these dogs, when they die,
do so with their tails up and wagging.

Who has suffered more, then? The pit
bull for his association with man? Or
man for his association with the pit bull?
It should be pointed out that pit bull ter-
riers serve man in a number of legal and
interesting ways. They are not just guard
dogs and ﬁghters. The stamina and
courage of the pit bull make the breed
unparalleled as a hunting dog for wild
pigs, a popular quarry in parts of the
South and Southwest. Some ranchers,
particularly those who graze livestock in
brushy country where it is diﬂ‘icult to

rope, use pit bulls as catch dogs for cat—
tle. They can also be trained to herd
sheep—pity the coyote that would both-
er a pit bull’s ﬂock. And, recreationally,
pit bull owners have started to show en-
thusiasm for weight pulling. “The pit

bull’s the hardest—pulling dog in the ‘

world,” brags Ralph Greenwood of the
American Dog Breeders Association.
Last year in Seguin, Texas, a 78-pound
pit bull named Bighead set a record by
pulling 5,650 pounds over rails for a dis—
tance of 15 feet.

Clearly, though, steps have to be tak—
en if man and the pit bull terrier are to
continue to coexist. “Dogﬁghting needs
to be prosecuted,” says Blair of Tufts,
“And effective vicious-dog legislation
needs to be enacted.”

There are a number of reasons why
“vicious dog” legislation is preferable to
ordinances that speciﬁcally target the
pit bull terrier. As has been noted, it is
virtually impossible to deﬁne a pit bull
in legal terms. There is also the nettle-
some question of punishing innocent, re—
sponsible breeders of American Staf-
fordshire terriers and American pit bull
terriers for the abuses of irresponsible,
often criminal, owners. And ﬁnally, the
pit bull is not the only aggressive dog
on the street. Rottweilers, Dobermans,
German shepherds, akitas and chows
are all breeds that can be aggressive and
that are large enough to inﬂict severe
damage on people and other animals.
For that matter, any breed that is im-
properly raised or is allowed to run loose
can become a menace. The population
of this country is more than 240 million
people, and “Ninty—seven percent of
Americans now live in cities, towns or
villages,” says Loew of Tufts. “There are
50 million dogs in this country, more
than at any time in our history. How are
we goingto live with them?”

“We suggest a procedure by which a
dog can be identiﬁed as ‘dangerous’ or
‘vicious’ that does not just take into con-
sideration bites,” says the Humane Soci—
ety’s Lockwood. “A dog that assumes a
threatening posture when unprovoked,
that lunges at its fence when someone
walks past, that chases kids—that is a
dangerous dog, even if it hasn’t actually
bitten anyone. The new thrust is to
make owners responsible for their dogs
before there’s a prOblem.”

This much we have learned from the
pit bull: The so-called “one free bite”

munities where a dog is not considered
to be a problem until it has bitten on two
occasions. In the case of the pit bull ter—
rier, that is usually two occasions too
many. David Sholes, a Rhode Island
state senator, proposed and drafted vi—

cious~dog legislation for his state in.

1985. It is now considered a prototype
for others to follow. “We had a tremen—
dous explosion of pit bull attacks, you
were reading about a new one practical-
ly every week,” says Sholes. “One child
lost part of a buttock, another
part of her face. A pit bull

rant, and has the right to seize and im-
pound the dog if any of the speciﬁca-
tions are not met to his satisfaction. If
the dog bites again, the owner is fully li—
able, much as if he had been keeping a
wild tiger in a cage.

_ “Most owners would rather turn in
their dog than comply,” says Sholes. “So
the net effect was to keep these vicious _

dogs oﬂ‘ the street.”

Of course the vast majority of prob-
lem pit bulls are unregistered and unli-
censed. These are the animals that law
enforcement ofﬁcials must focus on, and

T l

ﬁghting is not just aberrant behavior in a
civilized society, it has become a lethal
liability within that society. The best
new ordinances and leash laws in- the
world will be worthless unless the courts
deal with these people seriously. They
have to send a message that says: You
want to own these dogs, ﬁne. But you’ll-
pay the consequences if you screw up.”

It is a message that is already being
sent. In February, Hayward Turnipseed
of De Kalb County, 6a., was convicted
of - involuntary manslaughter and sen-
tenced to ﬁve years in prison after three

‘ of his pit bulls attacked and
killed four-year—old Billy

 

managed to get on a school
bus and terrorize the chil-
dren. It was apparent that
the current law was not
working.” '

The new Rhode Island law
provides a workable deﬁni-
tion of a “vicious dog”: One
that has either committed an
unprovoked attack on a per-
son or animal, or. that ap-
proaches a person in an ap-
parent attitude of attack
when unprovoked. That is
the key word: unprovoked.
Any dog that is unlicensed
falls into the “vicious” cate-
gory until 'it is licensed.
Rhode Island’s procedure for
having a dog declared “vi-
cious” is as follows: 1) the
complainant calls the local
animal control oﬁicer; 2) the
officer investigates the com-
plaint and holds a hearing to

 

 

 

 

Gordon as the child walked
through a neighbor’s yard.
Michael Berry, 37, the Cali-
fornia man who owned the
dog who killed two-year-old
James Soto, has pleaded not
guilty to a charge of
involuntary manslaughter.
And Edlyn Joy Hauser, the
woman whose dog, Benja—
min, attacked animal control
oﬂicer Crowell, has pleaded
innocent to three felony
counts of assault with a dead-
ly weapon—~Benjamin—and
intentionally. inﬂicting great
bodily harm.

As for the American pit
bull terrier, it, too, has taken
its lumps. In the three weeks
following those two grisly
June incidents in California,
more than 300 pit bulls and
pit bull crosses were turned in
to the Los Angeles County

 

 

examine the circumstances;

3) he then declares whether

the animal in question is “vi- BAZELAK RAISES CHAMPIONS FOR THE RING, HOT

cious” or not; 4) if the owner
of the dog disagrees with his verdict, he
may appeal to District Court.

Should his appeal fail, the owner of
the “vicious” dog must keep it in a se-
cure enclosure, at least six feet in height,
that is both childproof from the outside
and dogproof from the inside. The dog is
tattooed for identiﬁcation. Furthermore,
the dog owner must show that he has a
$100,000 insurance policy for liability,
and he is required to display a sign that
can be read from the road: VICIOUS DOG
ON PREMISES. The dog oﬂﬁcer has the
right to inspect the enclosure at any sub-
sequent time and without need of a war-

quickly. Unlicensed dogs should be im-
pounded. And anyone who knows of in-
dividuals who are keeping unlicensed
dogs, or whose dogs are allowed to run
loose, should be encouraged to report
them to the proper authorities. “We’ve
got to make bad—dog behavior imper-
sonal,” says Loew. “It should be like
asking someone who is smoking in a no-
smoking area to stop. No offense, but
your dog is a problem.”

“For a long time the judicial system
has not taken dogﬁghting and dog-bit-
ing seriously,” says Lapham. “That lais-
sez-faire attitude cannot persist. Dog—

Residents Want
? to ban pit bulls

By Paula Yost

 

OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

A month after a pit bullterrier burst
- through a screen door and killed Patricia
,Luecke’s small dog, almost 600 Richard-
son residents are asking the City Council
to ban pit bulls from the city.
_ “Pitbulls are not like other dogs.
They’re bred to ﬁght and kill,” said Ger-
ald Luecke, who with his wife, Patricia,

presented the council with a petition .

bearing 568 signatures on Monday. 1
The Lueckes, whose bichon frise was

killed by a neighbor’s pit bull on June i”
24, want stiff ﬁnes and a f?“

.‘i , di-
nance banning pit bulls. ‘ _
"Saying the pit bull problem
needs to be solved, council mem-
bers agreed to investigate the
niatter, which they say could lead
them to restrict the muscular,
Stout dogs from Richardson.
:3“I’ve been bitten by a dachs-
hgnd, a goat and a Doberman,”
Said Councilwoman Maryann
Eraley. “Those bites are repair-
able.” But the bite from the pow-
élfful jaws of a pit bull are not,
she said. ,
, :Monday night, before a gather-
ing of about 50 Richardson resi-
dents, Patricia Luecke recounted
the June morning when a pit bull
ripped through her screen door,
lunged at her 1-year-old son,
@meron, and attacked her bi-
chon frise. “If it‘hadn’t been for
iny dog, our story could be much
adder,” said Luecke, who attri-
‘utes her dog, Jean Claude, with
’saving her son’s life.
{According to the Human Soci-
ety of the United States, ﬁve peo-
ple have been killed by pit bulls
this year. And the Lueckes, who
researched pit bull attacks before
approaching the courw’s’: shared
horror stories they foin, in old
"pewspaper clippings: in 1982, two
gt bulls killed a 67-year-old
; arper, Kan, woman in her front
yard; in 1984, a pit bull trained to
ghunt pigs killed a 9-week-old boy
in his crib in St. Petersburg, Fla;
nnd this May, a pit bull dug un—

der a fence at the Houston Zoo,
and killed 3:3. wallabies, a kanga-

While statistics show pit bulls
do not bite as often as other
breeds — such as German shep-
herds — their bites are more seri—
ous. Reading from a prepared
pamphlet, Patricia Luecke told
the council that the jaws of a pit
bull can exert 1,800 pounds per
square inch - four times the force
of other breeds. And, unlike oth-
er dogs, she said, pit bulls tend to
hang on to their victims, ripping
and tearing like a shark.

If Richardson ofﬁcials adopt an
ordinance outlawing pit bulls,
they won’t be the ﬁrst. The
Farmers Branch City Council has
given the city staff a directive to
adapt an ordinance restricting the
dogs. And Addison Mayor Jerry
Bedding says he will push for an
ordinance banning pit bulls.

To Steve Bain, an ordinance
outlawing his two pit bulls would
be unfair. “A pit bull is an animal
that can be a good dog or a bad
dog,” he told the council. “It boils
down to the people who own the
dog and how they treat the dog.”

Bain says pit bulls are being
persecuted because of negligent
dog owners, who, in trying to be
“macho”, raise their pit bulls to
be mean and vicious. He said ir-
responsible owners raise their pit
bulls to ﬁght -— which is illegal in
the US.

Part of that training regimen
includes an ugly practice often
involving baby animals. “Kittens
and puppies are used to train
ﬁghting dogs,” said Doris Danner,
an adoption supervisor for the
Society of Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals. Fighting dogs include

Dobermans, German sheperds, l
but “basically, of course, it’s the
pits that they 11???? for this,” said ~
Danner.

Danner said she is forever
warning people to never give
away litters to one person. And
because of an exploding kitten
population, Danner says the de-
sire for kitten-bait is worse than.
ever. “This year, it’s extremely
bad,” she said.

Tafﬁe Norris says she was ap-g
proached separate times by two
men who wanted the entire litter
of kittens she was giving away.

“When I asked the ﬁrst man
why, he hung up. When I asked
the second man, he said, ‘Well,
it’s because I’m an animal lover
and I don’t want to see them put
to sleep.’ It just didn’t ring true,”
said Norris, of Garland.

Norris said she doesn’t know
how the kittens are used to train
the dogs. But, she said, the baby
felines are what people “use to
give pit bulls the. taste of blood. I
don’t know how they do it. 1T
don’t want to know how they do ‘
it.”

Bain, who doesn’t raise dogs to
ﬁght, told the council he’s owned
three pit bulls without incident.
“Yes, this dog can hurt you,” he
said. But, the pit bull most likely
will be protecting its own territo-
ry, he said.

Councilwoman Fraley said it
was the city’s job to protect un-
wary children who may wander .
into backyards occupied by pit
bulls. “You’re talking children’s _
lives here,” she said. “It’s sort of _

-a technician doing autopsies. He is
}'a man with a mission after 18 years
' of pathology work.

He has developed a reputation as
”an effective catalyst for environ—
mental reform.

“Wildlife is an important moni-
tor of the environment,” Stone says
in his office at the Conservation
Department’s Wildlife Resource
Center in rural Delmar, south of
Albany. "Changes in animal popu-
lations, sickness, death may be
telling us there could be problems
for us as well.” ,

The walls of Stone’s crampe

" office are covered with plaques and

plaudits from environmental
groups in recognition of his cru-
sades against pollutants.

Stone, 48, a stocky, bearish
ﬁgure in rumpled lab coat, jeans
and rubber mocc'asins, is frequently
invited to bring his morbid slide
show to meetings of wildlife groups,
such as the Audubon Society.

"He’s got a heck of a constitu-
ency among environmentalists,”
says Ron ’Dodson, an Audubon
lobbyist in Albany. “He’s been at
the leading edge of effecting change
in the regulation of pesticides and
other toxic substances at both the
state and federal level.” ’ '

Most recently, Stone was influen-
tial in getting the EPA to cancel
approval for the use of diazinon on

., golf courses and sod farms.

According to the EPA, an esti-
mated 512,000 pounds of diazinon is
used annually on golf courses. More .
than 86 incidents of diazinon-re-
lated bird kills across the country
have been reported to the agency.

Ingrid Sunzenauer, the EPA’s
review manager for diazinon in
Washington, says Stone gathered _
data from around the United .
States, providing "most of our data ’-
base showing the bird kills.”

Stone was among the first to
warn of widespread contamination
from polychlorinated biphenyls, or
PCBs -- industrial organochlorine '
com—pounds suspected of causing "
cancer and other ills. ,

"At first, it fell largely on deaf
ears,” he says. "I’d prepose studies, ‘
but they wouldn’t be acted on.” ‘

He says he wrote 102 memos on
the subject between 1970 and 1975,
but state officials didn’t pay atten-
tion until a federal scientist warned ‘
of PCBs in the Hudson River in .
1975. .

KISSIMMEE' (UPI) -— Like his cousin who position now that the dusky seaside was in \

apparently vanished from the planet last
month, the grasshopper sparrow seems des-
tined to succumb to man’s encroachment on
natural wildlife habitat.

“It’s the next bird that the Florida Audu-
bon Society predicts will become extinct,”
said Herb Kale, an Audubon ornithologist.

The last known dusky seaside sparrow, a
species once plentiful along the St. Johns Riv-
er wetlands, died June 16.

Only about 300 of the grasshopper spar-
rows remain, most of them in Osceola, Polk,
Highlands and Okeechobee counties. The spe-
cies’ small number makes it the rarest bird in
Florida, Audubon officials said.

. The bird has black and gray feathers with
. brown streaks on its back and was named the
grasshopper sparrow because of the sound of
1_ its song.
The grasshopper’s habitat is rapidly turn-
; ing into cow pastures, where ranchers put
non-Florida plants in place of the native
scrub, palmettos and grasses the bird needs
{‘9’ nesting and foraging.

during the late ’605 and early ’703,” said biol-
ogist Mike Delaney with the Florida Game
and Fresh Water Fish Commission.

Research zoologist Dale Jackson with‘the
state Conservation and Recreation Lands pro-
gram has asked the state to take control of

, 55,000 acres in southern Osceola County to

provide sanctuary for the sparrow and other
threatened species. ‘

The area near Kenansville also is home to

the sandhill crane and the bald eagle.

But Jackson said the grasshopper spar-
row’s plight is not well known, and public sup-
port to save the species isneeded beforethe
,governor and Cabinet will put the land on the
priority list for purchase under the conserva-
tion program.

-The grasshopper sparrow joined nine oth-
er Florida birds in September when it was
placed on the federal endangered species list.
Delaney, who has studied the insect-eating
bird for four years, said he can’t predict how
many years the bird has left. _

NEW YORK TIMES - July 21, 1987

Otter May Prove Fatal to Plan to Save Species

 

Azppetites of; Man and Sea ,

E ByROBERT LINDSEY
i Special to The New :York Times

MONTEREY, Calif., July 13 -- Fed-
ral officials are preparing to airlift a
anguard of seaotters more than 300
niles down the California coast in a
olonization effort that they describe
.5 essential to protecting the species
rom extinction. ‘

But a conservation project that once
eemed simple has blossomed into an
Imotional, suspenseful tugpf-war be-
ween man and animal over the same
nod. .

Commercial fishermen and divers
ire angrily resisting the plan. They
:ontend that otters have such vora-
:ious appetites that they will soon
:radicate the coast’s already reduced
:tock of abalone, the hard-shelled mol-
usk whose delicately flavored meat is
avored by many people, and sea ur-
:hins, whose roe is exported to Japan in
arge amounts as an ingredient for
:ushi. .

5300 Otters Survived Traders

The southern sea otter, a furry crea—
ure with the looks of a seagoing teddy
iear, once abounded on the West Coast.
t was thought to have been hunted vir-
ually to extinction by Russian fur'
raders in the 18th and 19th centuries,

wt in 1938 about 300 sea otters were '

liscovered in an isolated area off the
roast of Big Sur, south of here. Efforts
vere then begun to protect and expand
his small colony.

Since then the otter population, most _

‘ecently under' Federal protection as
an endangered marine mammal, has
increased to about 1,650. Consuming
about 25 percent of their body weight --
50 to 60 pounds for mature otters —-
each day in clams, abalone,'sea urchins

and other marine life, the otters have ‘

extended their range. They now forage
along a 225-mile stretch of coast be-
tween Santa Cruz, north of here, and
Morro Bay to the south.

Lazily swimming on their backs in
the surf, often using a rock to crack
open a shellfish, the bewhiskered four-
foot-long otters are a familiar and
popular sight along the coast. They

Oil Is a Danger to the Otter

In recent years, as oil production
jumped in California’s coastal waters,
the conservationsists have warned that
the newly expanded otter population is
threatened again with extinction. One
group, Friends of the Sea Otter, put it

 

this way in a recent publication: “Once

' . thiami- .
.

he:

A A

i

slaughtered in the ruthless rush for fur,
the California sea otter may again be
sacrificed, in the reckless drive for
oil.”

' Carol Fulton, the group’s executive
director, said a major spill from an oil
tanker along the Big Sur coast could
virtually wipe out the surviving otters.
Crude oil would mat their lush fur and
cause them to freeze in the chill Pa-
cific, he said.

At the urging of environmental
groups, the Federal Fish and Wildlife
Service developed a plan to divide the
otters into two groups, with the goal of

if a catastrophic oil spill occurred
within the range of the other. The pro-
jected cost of the relocation effort is $5
million, to be paid by the Federal Gov-
ernment. »

New Colony of 250 Envisioned

Under the plan, 70 otters would at
first be plucked out of the sea by divers
south of Big Sur and released at San Ni-
colas island, a barren parcel of hilly
land 70 miles southwest of Santa Bar-
bara that is used as a Navy missile
tracking site. If they thrived, more ot-
ters would be relocated in similar fash-
ion until the colony totaled 250.

But commercial divers, who com-
pete with the otters under water,
prying abalone shells off rocks with
crowbars, view the otters‘in a much
less favorable light than do the consero
vationists.

“You know, the otter is a relative of
the weasel, the wolverine and the
skunk," said Steven Rebuck, who heads
a group of divers who see the new otter
colony as a threat to their pocketbooks

.: , and hundreds of jobs.

Since 1957, he said, California’s com-
mercial divers had seen their abalone
catch fall from 5.7 million pounds annu-
ally to less than 700,000 pounds a year,
almost solely because of the large

- .appetite of the resurgent otter popula-

tion.

“When I was growing up in the 50's,"
Mr. Rebuck said, “abalone was poor
man's food.” Now it is so scarce that
the wholesale price is nearly $30 a
pound and many restaurants no longer
serve it. Establishing a southern otter
colony, Mr. Rebuck said, would soon
deplete much of the remaining com-
mercially viable grounds for abalone
and sea urchins.

Officials of the Fish and Wildlife
Service acknowledge that divers would
lose access to San Nicolas Island, but,
as part of the plan, the agency would
police surrounding waters and retrieve
any otters that strayed away from the

on the verge of fulfilling it. The fisher-

attempt to bar the transplanting of the
otters, and th y say their battle is far
from over. i)

the California Coastal Commission,

tests from fishermen,‘

 

which regulates coastal development,’

gave its approval to the plan last week
by a vote of 7 to 5. This left approval by
the State Fish. and Game Commission
as the final hurdle.

The commission was scheduled to
vote its approval of the plan this week
but lawyers representing fishing inter-
ests discovered a procedural error in
the scheduling of a hearing by the com-
mission. That delayed consideration of
the issue until mid-August, when the
otter relocation was scheduled to take

THORNTON - Any dog running loose that

attacks without provocation could immedi
ately be put to death under an innovative vi,
cious—dog law being proposed to Thornton’s
City Council. . ‘

proach may be unique.

Elliott and his staff devised the law after
ﬁnding out how hard it was under the current
law to dispose of a vicious dog that hit three

“We needed a tougher ordinance to spe
up the process of determining a dog is vicious
and putting it to sleep,” Elliott said.
Thornton also has received many citizen
suggestion cards asking for a stringent vi-

‘ ‘ f-ciousdog ordinance, said Elliott, noting that

“This ordinance has a lot of teeth, but it *
makes sense,” said Environmental Services .
”Director Casey Elliott, who says the ap- -

dog bites in the city are up 17 percent over
last year. ‘ . ‘ .
Elliott prefers his proposal to the “breed-

specific” laws that have been considered by ~
' many other cities. , .

right scenario, any dog could bite.”

The complex ordinance, which is expected ,
to be considered by the Thornton City Council f
in about a month, divides dog bites into three f

categories:

V A third-degree bite, the least serious, is
committed by a dog on his owner’s property .
after being provoked. Fines range from noth- ‘3

ing to $300.

w A second~degree bite can occur when -

g the dog! is away from home and is
provoked into biting; or on its own— §

' er’s property without provocation.
Penalties range from $100 to $300.

’ A dog convicted of a second-de-

. gree bite then is classified as a

dangerous animal, and its owners "

must comply with alist of rules

that also apply to all guard'dogs -

within the city.

These rules include containing '

i the dog within a 6-foot fence with

locked gates and posted signs; no- .

tifying neighbors within a 1.50-foot
radius of the property; provmg the

owner can control the dog; and ad-

ditional safety measures as deter-
mined on a case-by-case basis.

Failure to comply with those
regulations or a subsequent biting
incident would also classify a dog
as vicious and require that the am-
‘mal be destroyed, Elliott said.

V A firstvdegree bite is commit~
ted by a dog that is off its owner’s
property and attacks for no reason.
The offense carries a $300 fine,
classification as a vicious dog and
immediate destruction of the ani~
mal. -

Animal control officers have
some discretion when classifying a

bite, depending on circumstances,

_ , said .Elliott.

The ordinance defines a vicious

; dog as one that poses a serious
:‘ threat to the general health and

safety of a person or domestic ani'
mal. A dangerous animal is one
that poses a potential threat to peo-
ple and domestic animals.

The hard-line stance against
dangerous dogs is the second step
in Elliott’s two-pronged plan to re-
vamp Thornton’s animal-control
process.

Elliott earlier kicked off a cable
television program showcasing ani-
mals from the Adams County shel-

ter in hopes of reducing needless
euthanasia of adoptable pets.

Elliott said his staff wrote the

proposed law using bits from doz-
ens of other ordinances nation-
Vwide.

“I think it will work, and we’ve
got a lot of support for it,” he said.

Meanwhile, there was unani~
mous city council support in Com-.
merce City Monday night for an or~

dlnance requiring a pit. bull or

. pit-bull mix to be contained by a

iii-foot fence or' restrained on a
'leash controlled by someone 18 '
years or older. The law takes ef-
fect Tuesday, but city officials said
some leeway will be allowed for ..

Parents of tot, 3 killed by pit bu11 ..
sue its owners and their 1andlord‘

By Howard Pankratz
Denver Post Legal Affairs Writer

The parents 01 a 3- year-old Den-
ver boy killed last October by a
pit- -bull terrier sued the dog’s own-
ers and the owners’ landlord Tues-
'day.

Freddie and Lucille Salazar
claim in the suit that Gilbert and
Phyllis Troncosa failed in “their
duty” to keep their pit bull away
from the public and children, in-
cluding their son, Fernando Sala-
zar.

The Troncosas were well aware
of the vicious propensities of their
dog, Missy, and pit bulls in general
the Denver District Court lawsuit
says

The Salazars, of 1066 S Clay St.,
say Fernando wandered away
from his normal play area on Oct.
26 and into the yard of the Troncos-
as at 1099 S. Dale Court.

There, said the suit, “he was vi.
ciously and without provocation,
attacked by . . . Missy, causing his
death.”

 

Freddie and Lucille
Salazar claim, their son
was ‘viciously and
without provocation,
attacked by . . . Missy,
causing his death.’

 

Last March, Gilbert Troncosa, a
school janitor, was convicted of vi-
olating the city’s vicious dog, 11
censing and vaccination ordi-
nances in the fatal mauling.

A month later, Denver County

Judge Brian Campbell sentenced
Troncosa to 180 days in jail but su-
spended 135 days of the sentence.
Because the case is on appeal,
Troncosa has not served any time.

.91

At sentencing, Campbell noted
the attack on the Salazar boy was
the third attack since 1983 by one
of 'I‘roncosa’ s pit bulls.

The suit, which asks for unspec1-
tied damages, says the Troncosas
were Well aWare of Missy’s “vi-
cious propensities” because they
purchased and trained the dog to
be a “guard dog.”

Also sued was George A. Gra-
ham Sr., the owner of the triplex
where the 'I‘roncosas live. Despite
the fact that Graham was aware qt
the vicious propensities of pit bulls
and Missy, he rented to the Tron-
cosas anyway, the suit says. 11

Graham declined to commerft,
referring questions to his insur-
ance company.

The Troncosas’ attorney, Fred
Vondy, said Missy was not a W1
cious dog and had played with the
Troncosas’ daughter and other
children without incident. Vondy
contends Missy was “provoked. ”

The dog was destroyed after the
attack.

The uncanny powers of dogs, cats and other animals
are revealed in the fascinating new book ”Psychic
Animals,"_ by Dennis Bardens. In the following exclu-
sive ENQUIRER installment from the book Burdens
tells how a dog journeyed thousands of miles in
search of its owner . . . how a dead dog saved a spy
from the firing squad . . . and much more.

By DENNIS BARDEN'S

Dogs have been known to cross mountains and
rivers to find their masters. But no case is more as-
tounding than that of a terrier which tracked down ,
his master 5,000 miles away —— and crossed an ocean ,

to do it! .
In 1973 the Dutch ship S.S.
Simaloer docked in Vancou-

Willem Mante’s pet wire-
haired terrier Hector pad-
dled ashore to explore the
town, as he’d done in ports
around the world.

But when time came for,
the freighter to sail on tor

Japan, Hector still hadn’t re-
turned. Capt. Mante waited
and waited. Finally, heart-

broken, he set sail without"

his beloved pet. He decided
his dog had met with an acci-
dent, been stolen or gotten
lost. He never expected to
see him again.

The next morning an offi-
cer on another Vancouver-
docked ship, the SS. Hanley,
saw a. wire-haired terrier
walk up the gangplank of his
vessel. _

The dog seemed intent on
some mission, not just wan-
dering at random. He trotted
around the deck, went below
to sniff at the cargo and left.

The same thing was ob-
served by the crews of three
other ships in the harbor.
Hector had boarded the ves-
sels, looked around and then
disembarked and disap-
peared. '

Only when the Yokohama-
bound S.S. Hanley was two
hours out of port was Hector
found on board. Nineteen
days later, as the ship ap-
proached Japan, the canine
stowaway became noticeably
restless and, as the ship en-
tered Tokyo Bay, he was lit~
erally shivering with excite-
ment.

During the unloading of
the Hanley’s cargo, another
ship moved into- a berth
about 300 yards away, and
some men from the newly ar-
rived steamer sailed in a
' small boat near the Hanley’s
stern. As the craft ap-
‘ proached, suddenly the dog

rifle butts without SimpsOn’s
knowledge.

In the morning, as the con-

squad, he suddenly looked
down at a point just in front

mouth to give the command. ,

KISSIMMEE (UPI) — Yogi the
fugitive Florida black hear was
spotted twice Thursday near the
swamp he scurried into after escap-
ing the Gatorland Zoo, but would-be
captors were again frustrated in at-
tempts to return the 300-pound
beast to his cage.

Although a state game commis-
sion helicopter hovered most of the

‘ day over the area near the Orange-

Osceola County line, the search for
Yogi was hampered by the late ar-
rival of tracking dogs from North

f. Florida.

“The hopes are that these dogs
— they’re specially trained to track
bear - will get Yogi up a tree so

: the game folks can tranquilize hin‘:
‘_ and carry him‘back to the zoo,” said

Gatorland spokesman Mel Gentry.
Zoo staff, sheriff’s deputies and
members of the Florida :Game and
Fresh Water‘Fi‘sh Commission
scoured the swamp and adjacent

land but did not have as much luck
finding Yogi as passers-by. '

“Two motorists on (U.S.) 441
called us within the same hour to
report they’d seen this bear up
along the fence,” Gentry said about
the time the dogs arrived in the late
afternoon.

“The sightings were both at the
north end of our property —— at the
opposite end of where we thought
he was and where we’d been

looking,” Gentry said. .
bolted from his cage

Yogi
Wednesday after a caretaker left
the double doors of his cage un-
latched. The bear took off down the
2,000-foot wooden walkway built
through the swamp for 200 visitors.

A Gatorland employee caught
up with Yogi twice in the swamp
Wednesday and grabbed the bear
but couldn’t hold on.

Gentry said Yogi walked out on
his hind legs, standing about 7 feet

Boo-boo Y01 flee zoo

tall, and waved with both arms to
about 20 searchers who were gath-
ered in a clearing after an unsuc-
cessful foray into the swamp. Once
he had their attention, Yogi disap-
peared back under cover. .

“It’s like a game for him,” Gen-
try said. “He’ 5 really tame. He’s just
a pet. ” .

Gatorland is in Orange County
south of Orlando but nearer Kissim-
mee. Gentry estimated the swamp
where Yogi is holed up is abOut
1,000 feet long and about a quarter-
mile wide.

Yogi was brought to the zoo
about three years ago when the
wildlife commission found him
munching restaurant garbage in ,1
Jacksonville. ,

“He must be getting hot and
tired,” Gentry said. “And he’sso
used to being fed I’m not sure he’s
been able to eat much in there, but
at least he has plenty of water.” ‘

 

Disney to breed monkeys to.

nations and small institutions.

’ 13KB BUENA VISTA (AP) -— Walt Disney
“World soon will start breeding monkeys that will

'be trained to help disabled people by combing
.their hair or fetching their food.

The capuchin monkeys —— 5- to 7-pound pri-
imates also called organ- grinder monkeys — will
:be bred starting Oct. 1 for Helping Hands: Simian
Aides for the Disabled, a non-profit program in
Boston.

By taking over the breeding. Disney will save

,Zthe group $50,000 yearly, said behavioral scien-
-§tist_ Mary Joan Willard, who started Helping
iii-Hands 10 years ago.

:3 j' Helping Hands’ operating budget is $225,000,
5 about two-thirds of which comes from the Veter-

;ans Administration and the rest from private do-

Willard said that since she began training the
monkeys a decade ago, 10 have been placed with
quadriplegics, and she expects to place another
10 this year.

She said she chose the species because of its
quick intelligence and small size. That species is

regarded by most biologists as the most intelli-

gent of all monkeys.

Charlie Cook, curator of Discovery Island
where the monkeys will be bred, said the pro-
gram also will help preserve the species. While
the capuchin is not endangered, its natural hab1-
tat, the South American rain forest, is being vast-
ly denuded.

“As a conservationist, I think this is a great
idea to keep that many animals alive as a breed-

led“

' ing community,” Cook said. “It gives the animal
a chance and it helps a class of people who are
unfortunate.”

Cook hopes to have 80 monkeys in the breed-
ing program so he can provide 40 monkeys a
year to Helping Hands, which will place them in
foster homes when they are four .to six weeks
Old;

Unlike most of the Disney complex, the
breeding compound will be off-limits to visitors,
a measure meant to protect the animals from
communicable diseases transmitted by humans.

The monkeys are mostly brown or black, with

' white or beige hair on the face, chest and upper

arms. They are about 17 inches tall when grown,
with 18- inch tails.

Climbing pit bull -:

lea ves worried
families up tree?

By VICKIE JULIANO
Tribune Staff Writer

BRANDON —-— Scott and Suzanne Segien’s pit bull;

Tiger doesn’t just bark up trees — she climbs them. ‘

“1 ~e ‘- 'II‘ n -10; W ‘3‘

-' m" ..

PM

And the dog’s antics have some of the Segiens’ L
neighbors worried that the dog may climb a tree or f,
fence, jump into their yards and attack their chil- :4

dren.

But the Segiens, who live at 106 Grove St., say ;

they've raised their dogs to be gentle and the ani- ;
mals wouldn’t harm a soul. In addition to 7-year-old .
Tiger, the Segiens have a 5-year-old pit bull named i

. , Sammy.

“I would state my life on it that they would never. =
hurt anyone,” Suzanne Segien said. “I have trust in f

my animals’

The Segiens, who have a Zl/z-year-old daughter, 7

have had Tiger and Sammy since the dogs were

puppies. Tiger began climbing trees when she was .

less than a year old, Suzanne Segien said.
“She just-started by chasing a squirrel up a tree
one day and has been doing it ever since,” said

Suzanne Segien. Sammy, however, isn’t as coordinat- ,

~ ed and can't follow Tiger up the trees.

Dr. Norman Busciglio, a Brandon veterinarian, -, ‘

said a dog climbing a tree isn’t something you see

every day.
” “As a general rule, dogs don’t

climb trees ” Busciglio said “They
don’t have the proper padding and

nails to grasp trees and don’t have
the coordination.”

Ronald and Pam Rogers, who
moved next door to the Segiens just
three weeks ago, don’t think a pit

'bull climbing a tree is so fascinat-
ing. The Rogers have him children

ranging in age from 3 to 11 and fear

[VJfOr their youngsters’ safety.

“I don’t want there to be any

‘hard feelings with 'our neighbors,
"but I just don’t believe the dogs be-

long in a residential area with chil-
dren,” Pam Rogers said. ."We just

‘want them to have the dogs re-

strained in some way so the kids

can feel safe.”

ThetRogers’ swimming pool is

next to the 6-foot wooden privacy

fence bordering the Segiens’ yard.

Tam Rogers said the dogs bark and

rush at the fence every time she or

her children are in the back yard.

“It’s a very old fence, and they
could push it down,” Pam Rogers

,said. “I’m making my kids paranoid

by always telling them to stay away' '

i from the fence.”

Scott Segien said he keeps both
dogs on chains whenever he’s not
around.

“I’ ve never had complaints from

5 any neighbors until now,” Scott Se-

gien said. “The Rogers said they
were worried, and I told them there
have never been any incidents. My
dogs are good neighbors.”

With pit bull attacks making the
headlines frequently these days,
many people are wary of the ani-
mals. And that’s unfortunate, he
said.

“I’m aware of the fear,” Scott
Segien said. “I wouldn’t let my child
near a Stray dog either. But they’re
victims of hysteria. If people could.
just get past‘the hysteria.”

The Rogerses said they bought f

their house because it’s in a quiet
neighborhood on a dead-end street
where their children can ride their
bicycles safely. But because of the
dogs, “I’m afraid to even let my 3-
year-old out in the front yard to
feed the squirrels,” Pam Rogers
said.

The. Segiens believe irresponsi-
ble owners are to blame for pit bull

attacks and if a dog suddenly turns

 

 

 

on its owner, it’s because the animal
has been abused.

“The-owners have a bitterness
inside themselves, and they take it
out on their dogs,” Suzanne Segien
said. “I know people who’ ve agitat-
ed their pit bulls as puppies and
then teach them how to fight. ” _

Pam Rogers said she believes
the. way pit bulls act has nothing to
do with training or their owners.

“I’ve seen the talk shows. and
read the articles,” Pam Rogers said.
“They don’t have to be antagonized.

3‘ They have an instinct.”

The Segiens’ neighbors Said they

will soon begin circulating a petitiOn
calling for the County Commission
to pass an ordinance either prbhibit-
ing people who live in residential
neighborhoods from owning pit
bulls or requiring the dogs to be
heavily chained at all times. '

“As long as the man (Segien) is
around, they heed his call,” said
Donna Pettis, another neighbor.

“But you never know when they’ll
be out in the yard without him. The
dogs should always be on a heavy

chain to give us some peace of
mind”

Biologist gets the Call, 5  _ ;
to handlethe wildlife

in metro Atlanta area

By Charles Salter

Staff Writer .

A state wildlife biologist in
metropolitan Atlanta has learned
to expect the unexpected in work
that involves close encounters with
a variety of critters ranging from
nuisance raccoons to big, danger-
ous cats from ‘Africa.

Bob Monroe of Cartersville, as-
signed to the Game Management
Division of the state Department
of Natural Resources in Atlanta,
has spent several years handling
urban wildlife cases in Fulton, De-
Kalb, Gwinnett, Cobb, Douglas and,
Rockdale counties.

Most of the calls were from
homeowners complaining about
squirrels nesting in attics, raccoons
raiding garbage cans at night, bea-
vers damaging ornamental shrubs
and trees, or snakes residing
around ivy and rock gardens in
landscaped yards. But he has spent
some suspenseful, tense hours seiz-

ing, transporting and finding new‘

homes for lions, tigers, cougars,

lynxes, bears and snakes that were.

abandoned, held in extremely poor
conditions, or owned without a.
'state permit. '

Monroe, 45, who majored in 20-.

ology and earned a master’s de-,
gree in wildlife management at!
the University of Georgia, chuck-'
led as he recalled the cold, rainy
night several years ago when DNR
personnel seized and loaded onto;
trucks some exotic animals owned,
without a permit by a man in a‘
rural area of metro Atlanta.

“He had seven wolves, two ti-.
gers, two cougars and one lynx,”
Monroe said. “We had deer-carry-
ing crates and [live] bear traps. It
was obvious to me a bear trap was
not quite the thing to put a tiger
in. These were nervous and active
animals.” .

The animals’ owner agreed to
help load them and offered use of
his big stock trailer.

“The wolves were semi-tame,
but I wouldn’t want to go in and
mess with them,” Monroe said.
“He put them in our deer-carrying
crates made of plywood. The
wolves immediately began eating
them from the inside out. I heard

3 Hours later, the workers final:
ly finished loading the crated ani-
mals onto the trailer. Then the

Y‘ truck and stock trailer slid off the

country road into a ditch. As rain

“I walked over to my truck
and discovered the cougar had eat-
en a hole in the end of the deer
crate, and his head and shoulders
were sticking out,” Monroe said.
“At almost 3 am, we knocked on
a farmer’s door and asked him to
lend us some lumber, a hammer
and nails to rebuild that crate to
carry the cougar.”

Arrangements had been made
for the Fulton County animal con-
trol agency to take the wolves, and
other animals were to be farmed

7 out. An Atlanta veterinarian had

agreed to provide quarters for a
tiger. .

“I was driving down Ashby
Street in Atlanta about 3:30 am.
with a big tiger in an Open cage in
the back of my truck,” Monroe.

Increased media attention and ;

Rabies-Animal Control, said his
;‘office is receiving more phone
f calls from people who ask, “What »
, are you guys going to doabout pit

bulls?” ' ‘

1 Pit-bull breeder Robin ’Ander-
son of Snowﬂake said that rather

than ban a breed of dogs, some-
thing should be done about the
people who abuse or train the
dogs to be mean. »

“Only those people who abuse
these dogs will get abusive dogs. ”
If you beat your kids, you’ll get
mean teen-agers and adults,” she
said. Anderson was in the Valley
this weekend to sell two 12-
week-old pups. She said her
husband, Tom, remained at home

' " :with their four adult pit bulls and t-‘r‘

‘ their 9-month-old son,- , ‘ .

i Robin Anderson said she does.

fnot fear the dogs being around
' her infant son. The couple have
, been breeding the dogs for, about
', a year, “more as a hobby than as
a business,” she said. '
l “These dogs have to be trained‘
or abused to be bad,” she said. .,

4 “They ought to screen the people
’ who buy the dogs. . . . If somebody
‘ cbmes around and starts hitting at

the dog to see how tough the dog 18
in response, then I won’t sell my
pup to that persbn.”
' She said attempts to outlaw the
breed are akin to outlawing guns
because some people use them for
‘ criminal and violent purposes.

Theresa Kelley was more blunt.
Kelley, who owns a 3-year-old pit
i bull named Cookie Monster, said
banning the breed would be~ dis-
criminatory.

“I think it would be the same .as
banning black people,” Kelley said.

l “To ban one breed of dog doesn’t
seem right.”

Ganser said Rabies-Animal Con-

trol keeps no records on the number .
of pit bulls in the county, nor does
it keep track of the number of
complaints involving the dogs.
I: . He said that for every 10 calls he
receives against pit bulls, he probae
bly receives one in favor. . ;
In the last year or so, three of his
officers have been bitten badly
enough by pit bulls to require
hospital treatment, he said.

Ganser said Rabies-Animal Con-_
trol officials have taken no posrtion
on ordinances regarding pit-bull
ownership, but warn people to
confine them. .

‘He said the breed is unpredict-
able and has a powerful jaw that,
once clamped, will tear and pull. ,.

, “If they attack, they attack to
kill,” Ganser said.

Guadalupe officials said they

have not had any incidents involv-
ing pit bulls, and are consrdering
the measure strictly as a preventive
measure. ’

Vanacour, the Glendale manager,
said he has assigned his staff
members to investigate how other

-, communities across the country
1, have dealt with pit bulls. .
_ Glendale staff members will
{3 study various ordinances, ranging
from some sort of “vicious-dog” law
5" to, an outright ban, Vanacour said.
,. A vicious-dog law could provrde
penalties for owners of dogs who
injure people'or could put restric-
3 tions on the way such dogs could be
'r kept, such as in fenced yards. .
' Glendale Councilmen Richard
; Bellah, Joe Falbo and Quentin
. Tolby asked that the matter be
3 investigated, he said.

‘Bellah said’ne became interested i

in the issue after reading that a
Glendale police officer was attacked
and bitten in May by a pit bull and
after hearing a radio program about
the breed.

Bellah said he favors a ban, but .

. he acknowledged that it could get
complicated, especially in dealing
with a dog that is only one-half pit
bull, for example.

In Paradise Valley, the Town
Council directed the town attorney
to look into the issue after a
resident called attention to pub-
lished reports of attacks and sug-
gested that the council take action. ‘

Charles Ollinger, the town attor-
ney, is scheduled to address the
council Thursday.

Ollinger said that his research
shows some ordinances have been
upheld and that whether an ordi-
nance is overturned depends on
how it is drafted.

He said the best is a “vicious-
' dog” law that does not single out a
particular breed. .

Kelly said she would support
some form of vicious-dog law.

“I don’t want my kid bit by a
vicious dog any more than someone
else does,” she said.

Paradise Valley council members.

have yet to say they are ready for
an ordinance banning the dogs.

Dennis Tinberg, Peoria city man-
ager, said that before adopting any
ordinance, he wants to know a
precedent has been set by a larger
Valley city that can defend its
enforcement in court. ‘

Tinberg said the Peoria council
will debate the matter during a
session sometime in September.

In Apache Junction, a “danger-
ous-animal” ordinance under study
is considered a preventive measure.

Two years ago, a 4-year-old girl
nearly was killed by two pit bulls,
according to police Lt. Dan Scott,
who said the dogs ripped through a
screen door and attacked the girl as
she walked down the street.

Scott said one of the dogs had
the girl’s head 1n its mouth and the
other grabbed her leg. He said the
attack was stopped by a passer~by,
but not before the child suffered a
puncture wound to the skull and
several cuts on her face and leg.
The girl still is undergoing plastic-

surgery operations.

If Apache Junction adopts the.

dangerous-animal ordinance, own-
’ ers of animals that harm people or
damage property would be charged
f with a criminal offense. That is
. stricter than the city’s current leash
. law, violations of which are a civil
offense.

‘:
V- .v-‘a .-.. rs.

Ganser, the rabies- control offi-
cial, said 19 Maricopa County
municipalities have leash laws,

which usually hold owners respon-_
*sible for damage by a loose dog.

That is where responsibility

should lay, according to Richard

Negus, president of the Arizona
Society for the Prevention of Cru-
elty to Animals. Negus said adopt»
ing tougher laws to penalize dog

owners would be more effective
. than banning or restricting pit bull
ownership.

Negus, who also is chairman of

.Phoenix’ 8 Committee for the Pro

motion of Canine welfare, said he"
recently asked Mayor Terry God- .

dard to help create, possibly
r.through the Maricopa Association
of Governments, a countywide
panel that would study dog- owner-
ship laws

“We need to look at the laws and
,make sure they’ re sufficient to
prosecute animal owners,” Negus

, said.

. It is not unreasonable, he added,
.to charge an owner with assault
with a deadly weapon or involun-

TAMPA TRIBUNE - July 23, 1987

Cats saw

leash Ia W consrdera tion

By JIM SLOAN
’3Tribune Staff Writer

 

TAMPA — A county official’s
plan to leash Hillsborough County
cats went the way of used kitty lit-
ter Wednesday.

The man who trashed it, County
Administrator Larry Brown, said he
doesn’t think county commissioners
want cats leashed, and, until they
tell him otherwise, “I’d just as soon
let sleeping cats lie.”

Animal Control Director Dan
Gorman, who came up with the idea
18 months ago, said cat leashing
won’t be among the proposals he
presents today to a panel studying
revisions to' the county’s Animal

. Control ordinance.

The proposal died a quick death
Wednesday when Gorman’s bosses

read about the plan in The Tampa

Tribune. They had no idea he was

considering leashes for cats.

“When i saw the morning paper
I said, ‘What the hell is going on?’ ”
Brown said. “Where did this come
from?” .

A couple of commissioners
asked Brown essentially the same
question. Hegcalled Gorman’s boss.
Public Safety Director Gil Rodri-
guez called Gorman. And the plan
to leash cats got its claws pulled.

Rodriguez said he thought the
proposed revisions were aimed only
at cracking down on vicious dogs.

“I guess I Should have looked at
that draft ordinance a lot closer,”
he said.

Commissioner Jan Platt, who
owns two cats, called the idea “to-

‘tally impractical.”

“To put a cat on a leash is al-
most laughablei In fact,” she said as
she broke into laughter, “it is laugh-
able.”

”’shOuld be allowed to give his or heri-2

- responsible pit bulldog owners in

plined and gentle which is ew-
dence that these animals will re-
spond to love and patience as most
pets do. Animals more often than
not reflect the disposition of their
owners or close companions.

Pit bulldogs are moreequipped
for fighting and aggressrve action
than other breeds; therefore, when

. a pit is placed in an environment

a which encourages its use of “yaw

' and a never-give-up” attitude, the

‘ results are dangerous to animals.

beled as pit bulldogs.

Other owners such as those who
train and sell pits for home protec-
tion, the breeders of pits, the train-
ers and fighters of pits, and these
people who own pits for protection
should give their views of pitbull-

’ dogs and how best to cope wrth the
I problems they create.

Houston needs to take legislative '

action soon! However, we all know
a law is only as good as its enforce-

ment, so city officials shouldn’t as-
sume the problem is solved once a

3 come victims of pit bulldogs.

’ 7 ‘As with any problem, several
‘:.i’VieWpoints must be heard. First

j and foremost, any legislation

TL. passed for the purpose of control-

' ling pit bulls should be based on

fact, not emotion. It’s easy for the
7‘Lpit bull problem to become an.

. emotional issue with little consider-

12' ation of facts. This is understand-

' able as anyone who has been bitten
by an animal can become emotion-

» ally upset quickly. I would like to

see the City of Houston take the
j lead in addressing this problem.

f . ~The Mayor is advised to appoint
an ’ad hoc study group to investi- ,
gate to control pit bulldogs and oth- .

,Iple, especially children, in" Califor-

¥.l The pit bulldog is a nationwide
'1. problem and, unfortunately, the
fjrnore negative publicity the ani-

" mals receive, the more popular
__they become with some segments
,of society. The exact number of pit
bulldogs in the Houston area is un-
known, but be assured there are
’j thousands.

. ' These dogs can be found in

backyards with poor fences,

“chained to trees or the comer of a
J house, or running free in old build-

“ caring families who take an interest

in the animal’s welfare and its dis-

cipline.
, Many pit bulls unfortunately be-
long to those who engage in fight-
j ing dogs for the sport of it. These
: pits are victims of sadistic minds;
, however, it doesn’t change the fact

new ordinance is passed. Maxi-

Arriving at 7lst Street and Park Avenue at

the dog’s owner thought he had come too early.
_ "Inform her that we’ll see her Monday,” Mr.
5 Buck snapped. “Anyone going to work should
be up by now. Dogs enter my program at my
discretion. it is a privilege to be in this group.”

dog, Morgan, a cocker spaniel appeared al-
most instantly.

Behavior

 

 

“Time Bombs on Legs”

 

Violence-prone owners are turning pit bulls into killers

Fire burst from its open mouth, its eyes
glowed with a smouldering glare, its muz-
zle and hackles and dewlap were outlined
in ﬂickering ﬂame. Never in the delirious
dream of a disordered brain could an y-
thing more savage, more appalling, more
hellish, be conceived than that dark form
and savage face.

t is as if the vicious hound

of the Baskervilles that
burst upon Sherlock Holmes
out of the fog has returned to
haunt the streets of Ameri-
ca. The creature last week
attacked a 71-year-old wom-
an in Stone Mountain, Ga.,
dragging her across her
driveway and savaging her
so badly that she required
100 stitches. It snapped and
tore at an unemployed man
as he watched the July 4 ﬁre-
works in Rochester; last
week he died from his multi-
ple injuries, including a 15-
in. wound from calf to thigh.
And in Atlanta, Houston
and Ramsay, Mich, it has
seized small children like
rag dolls and mauled them
to death in a frenzy of
bloodletting.

The new canine terror is the Ameri-
can pit bull, a dog with a squat, muscular
body and thick, steel-trap jaws that is de-
scended from the ﬁghting bulldogs of 19th
century England. In 21/2 years it has been
responsible for 16 deaths across the coun-
try, six of them in the past year, leading
many munic1palities to pass laws to re-
strict ownership. It 1s estimated that there
are now 500,000 unregistered, often poor-
ly bred pit bullterriers in the US. So fear-
some is the dog’s reputation that it has be—
come imbued with much the same
malevolent aura as the beast in Arthur
Conan Doyle’s story. That is exactly the
effect sought by sbme owners, among
them dog-ﬁghting enthusiasts, members
of street gangs and drug pushers, many of
whom use revolting and painful tech—
niques to bring the animals to the verge of
bloodlust.

Ofﬁcials of animal- -protection societ-
ies tell of pit bulls being given live kittens
or small dogs, such as poodles, to tear
apart. Often they are fed gunpowder or
hot sauce in the mistaken belief that this
will increase the animals pain threshold.
Jean Sullivan, director of the Memphis—
based Humane Society, charges that some
owners have tried to increase their dogs’
natural aggressiveness by keeping them
tied up with collars of baling wire or run-

 

ning them on treadmills until they are ex-
hausted. The pit bull’s jaws—which can

exert as much force as 1,800 lbs. per sq.

in.—-—are strengthened by swinging the
dog on a rope, its teeth clamped to a tire.
This, she says, makes the animal a “lethal
weapon. They hang on until their prey is
dead.” Such techniques, says Franklin

Loew, dean of the Tufts University veteri-
nary school, turn the dogs into "‘time
bombs on legs.” Many are used for high-
stakes dog ﬁghting, which has a sizable
nationwide following, even though it is a
felony 1n 36 states.

day with their drug-dealer" owners on the
corner of Ninth and Butler streets in
North Philadelphia. The dogs, with
names like Murder, Hitler and Scarface,
wear metal-studded collars concealing
crack and cocaine and the day’s proceeds.
They are equally visible on Chicago’s
West and South sides, where teenage boys
have taken to brandishing their ﬁerce pit
bulls just as they would a switchblade or a
gun “Its a macho thing, like carrying a
weapon” says Jane Alvaro of the Anti—
Cruelty Society.

Why are so many Americans indulg-
ing in this orgy of pain and
violence? “The dogs are al-
most like an extension of the
owners’ egos,” says Orville
Walls, a Philadelphia veteri-
narian. “The owners think,
‘I may be low man on the
economic totem pole, but I
have the meanest, toughest
dog on the street.’ ” Owning
a pit bull, says Robert Arm-
strong, Houston’s chief ani-
mal controller, “is a warning
to others to stay off the side-
walk.” Randall Lockwood
of the Humane Society notes
that the animals have be-
come increasingly popular
as dog ﬁghting has moved
from rural areas into cities.
They appeal “to the disfran-
chised and the unemployed.
The owners themselves are
often violent.” Tufts’ Loew
sees the bonding of owner
and dogas akin to a “horror movie,” with
maladjusted owners training their dogs to
be an “extension of themselves.”

As a result of the growing fear of these
killer dogs, responsible owners have been

put on the defensive. The name pit bull

loosely applies to a crossbred strain of the
American Staffordshire terrier and the
American pit bullterrieras well as to oth-
er varieties. The most ferocious dogs, says
Pat Owens, director of the Women’s
S.P.C.A. of Pennsylvania, are crossbred
with German shepherds or Doberman
pinschers. Richard Laue of the Northern
California Pit Bullterrier Association ac-
cuses these “backyard breeders” of pro-
ducing unpredictable‘ ‘garbage dogs.”

Despite the dogs’ bloody reputation,
owners such as Laue insist that purebred
pit bulls have a “steady temperament and
intense loyalty.” Indeed, breeders believe
that in time the animal will regain its
gentler image of the 19305, when a pit bull
played Pete 1n the Our Gang ﬁlms. Only
30 years ago, notes Ed Almeida a dog
trainer in El Monte, Calif, the Doberman
was the most vicious of dogs Now he
says, after years of careful breeding Do-
bermans are “big boobs” compared with

T.” Contributing Reporter

A pair of pest-sniffing beagles
gave the historic Old North
Church a long-needed inspection
yesterday.

Legions of termites and bee-

: ties have been disturbing the
foundation of the church, whose
basement contains crypts hold- .
ing the bodies of 1.100 of Bos-
ton's 18th and 19th century citi-
Zens.

Rev. Robert Golledge, vicar of
the historic church in the North
End for 16 years, asked for the
service after discovering that
squeaking floors and eroding
wood beams were being eaten

away and not just aging natural-

“We haven‘t had an inspec-
tionin a long time,” he said.
“Not since I‘ve been here."

The dogs, he said, can pin-

‘ point infested areas, and it is
preferable to exterminate specif-
ic areas than to randomly spray
noxious pesticides throughout
the church. as is the normal pro-
cess.

Terminix, a Boston pest con-
trol firm. provided the animals
for the inspection and will exter-.
minate the premises for free.

The church has been infested
with subterranean termites.

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for letting me know of your concern about Congressional
action to delay the implementation of Turtle Excluder DeV1ce (TED)
regulations by the Department of Commerce.

I appreciate your including the New York Times editorial. It was
correct in pointing out that some Members of Congress have been
successful in passing such legislation, but I am happy to report that
it does very little.

The Department of Commerce had planned all along to wait on
implementing the TED regulations until October 1, 1987, Since they
were only formulated late this spring and since the shrimping season
runs from April to September in most parts of the Gulf Coast. lt was
considered unduly harsh to require re~fitt1ng of shrimp boats With

TEDs in mid~season. Legislation was passed to delay the TED rules

until October 1, but this simply made a policy into law.

There may be efforts to delay these rules further, and I assure
you that I will monitor this situation very closely. As you know, our
Georgia shrimpers have accepted the TEDs as necessary ano Will be
following the regulations wholeheartedly once they go into effect.

Thank you again for taking the time to write to me. Please keep

in touch.

é
o; Dogﬁghters breed for danger -- 2-]

By MICHAEL D. DUNN
Tribune Staff Writer

2 TAMPA — Across America, as if
suddenly commanded by some demonic
spirit, pit bull dogs are on the attack.

. In June, a 255-year-old boy was fatal-
1y; mauled in California by a 50-pound
pit bull guarding its master's marijuana
Patch.

I In Cincinnati, a policeman shot a pit
bull ninetimes—fivetimssinthehead
—. with a .357-caliber Magnum before
the dog stopped attacking and fell dead

And last month outside Tampa an
1&month-old babys skull was partially
crushed and his ear torn off by a pit bull
When the boy wandered into a back
yard in Dover.

“He's got a lot of treatment to go,
plastic surgery and skin grafts," said the
baby's father, John Varnum of Lake-
land. “Part of his skull was completely
crushed. Doctors say it was a miracle he
came through it.”

Newspaper editors usually say "dog
bites man” isn’t news. But it is now. An
uncanny wave of pit bull attacks nation-
wide has communities perplexed and
frightened. The pit bull dog quickly is
building a reputation as man's worst
friend.

Animal lovers chalk it off as media
sensationalism, the sudden increase in
reports of serious dog-related injuries.
But Randall Lockwood. animal behavior-
ist and director of higher education for
the Humane Society of the United
States, has the hard, cold facts.

"Certainly there has been an in-

crease in the representation of pit bulls,

in fatal attacks. We’ve had five fatal at-
tacks in the United States this year and
all of them were by pit bulls," he said.
"‘That means 100 percent of the dog~re
lated fatalities were from a dog that
makes up less than 1 percent of the
country's dog population."

Reports of pit bull attacks are pour-
ing in from acros the nation, Lockwood
said. More than 600 communities have
contacted the Humane Society request-
ing information about animal-control or-

cea

Suddenly the pit bull has the atten-
tion of lawmakers, humane societies,
veterinarians, kennels and dog owners:

0 A growing number of people are

i s
tive director of the\Humane Society of
Tampa Bay.

He said the animals are used tor

wild-hog hunting, illegal dogfighting or -

as guard dog.

The term “pit bull” commonly is
used to describe a wide variety of ani-
mals, including the American pit bull
terrier and the American Staffordshire
terrier. The term also is used to refer to
mixtures of these breeds with one anoth-
er and with a variety of other breeds.
The dogs are characterized by compact,
muscular bodies and jaws that can exert
1,500 pounds of pressure per square
inch.

Tough ethical questions are involved
in the escalating pit-bull controversy,
Snyder said. The public must be proton,-
ed, he said, yet the breed really isn’t k)
blame, and people should be allow to
have the dog of their choice. -

The Humane Society of the United
States angered some animal lovers re-
cently when officials said they support a
policy of killing pit bulls rather than put-
ting them up for adoption.

Allowing people to adopt pit bulls
from a shelter, Lockwood said, is like
“taking a crap shoot.”

“We’re not saying all pit bulls that go
into shelters should be killed," he said?
“(The policy) is a reasonable solution to
an unfortunate problem."

The Humane Society of Tampa Bay
rarely adopts out a pit bull, and then
only when the temperament of the dog
is known and an extensive background

'check has been completed on the people

wanting to adopt. The background check
is needed to ensure the dogs are not
adopted for illegal dogfighting.

Stray dog whose backgrounds and
temperaments are unknown are de-
stroyed because therisklstooblgto
allow adoption, Snyder said.

A number of individual shelter oper-
ators, however, disagree strongly with
that policy.

“I don't see how they (national ?I-
cials) can call themes ‘humane

Gentlemen:

Have just been informed you are considering issuing a
stamp commemorating the cruel "sport" (mistreatment of
animals would be a more honest name) of rodeo.

This is a vote against such a stamp. Rodeo is nothing
morethan the misuse and abuse of animals, and if you
have doubts about this contact the Humane Society of
the U.S., the American Humane Assn., and any Humane
Society in any city in the U.S.

This is a so—called "sport” which should have been dis-
continualwhen this country became civilized — and there
are times when it is anything but.

we do not need a stamp to commemorate the broken bodies
of cattle which rodeo represents, and I hope the committee
will put hands down on such a stamp.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough

Jean White of Carrollton appears-Monday with Branch City Council to argue against an ordi-

her pit bullterrier, Bravo, before the Farmer’s

nance that would ban the breed within the city.

Pit bull enthusiasts ward off ordinance

By Michael Sawicki
OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

FARMERS BRANCH —-— Re-
sponding to the protests of a
crowd who said pit bullterriers
are getting a bum rap, the Farm-
ers Branch City Council backed

 

away Monday from a proposed

ordinance that would ban the ani-
mals, voting instead to form a
committee to recommend ways to
control vicious dogs of all breeds.

With a pit bull named Bravo
looking on, more than 80 owners
and supporters of the dogs de-
scribed them as loyal and well-
behaved.

Three people spoke in favor of
the ordinance, which council
members asked city ofﬁcials to
draft earlier this month after sev-
eral highly publicized attacks by
pit bulls on people and pets.

Jean White, the owner of 6-
year-old Bravo, a registered Staf—
fordshire bullterrier, criticized the
proposed ordinance as attacking
the results, and not the cause, of

the problem.

“They’re singling out a breed
for problems caused by the oWn—
er,” White said. “It’s not the dog
that’s responsible. It should be

In recent months, pit bulls
have been thrust into the national
spotlight after a series of attacks
in which people have been killed
or maimed by the dogs. Original-
1y bred in Britain to ﬁght other
dogs to the death, pit bulls long
have been targets of complaints

because of their aggressive nature

and tendency to inﬂict serious
wounds.

Fueling the controversy was
last week’s attack on 3 Farmers
Branch woman, who suffered
deep cuts when she tried to sepa-
rate her two pit bulls after they
got into a ﬁght.

Earlier this month in Richard-
son, a pit bull jumped through a
screen door and killed a smaller
dog as it tried to protect its own-
er, Patricia Luecke.

Luecke attended the meeting
with her baby son to voice her

support for the ordinance ban-
ning pit bulls and later agreed to
serve on the committee, even
though she is a Richardson resi-
dent. ,

the person who owns him.”

To illustrate her point, White
brought Bravo, muzzled and on a
leash, into the council chambers.
Bravo panted through most of
her speech and at one point
stretched out on the council floor
and refused to budge.

Mayor John D. Dodd said the
council would form a 12-member
committee to review the pro-
posed ordinance and explore
ways to extend its provisions to
owners of other breeds. The pro-
posal as presented to the council
Monday would have prohibited
pit bulls from being brought into
Farmers Branch and required
owners of the dogs already in the
city to purchase $75,000 in liabili-
ty insurance.

“The city wants to put the bite
on vicious dogs rather than let
the dogs put the bite on people,”
Dodd said. ‘

 




MEMPHIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL - July 27, 1987

 

 

 

 

‘3 Legal leas

By Neal R. Peirce

 

A pit bulldog named Gadhafi goes
berserk at the sight of another
, dog, strains at his leash, bites his own
' tongue, sprays saliva and blood. An-
other psyched-out pit bull is so keen to
attack it tries to chew its way through a
J chain-link fence.

And a street dude named Eric tells

' about the litter of eight young pit bulls ~ '

he’s raising. Only eight weeks old,
they’re already — literally — at each

other’s throats. , ,

' When my photographer colleague
Shepard Sherbell came back from Bal-
timore’s Liberty Hill neighborhood
with those reports last week, I decided
this was one urban story I was happy to
learn of secondhand. ’

But what of the pit bulls? Can this
summer’s wave of horror stories be
passed off as media hype? Hardly. Pit
bulls have inflicted 21 of the nation’s
29 fatal canine attacks since 1983. Four-
teen of the victims have been children
under 6 years of age. Each story of a
mutilated youngster’s body, torn by
the vise-like jaws that close. with 1,800
pounds of pressure, ripping off flesh
with sure intent to kill, is more appall-
ing than the last.

And for each fatality, there are doz-
ens of other pit-bull attacks that leave
victims with lifetime scars, physical
and psychological.

This wave of terror stalking Ameri-

can streets can only worsen. There’s an
explosion of pit-bull breeding in ghet-
toes and barrios where idle, embit-
tered youth have chosen the animals
as “macho” status symbols, to fight and
wager on. In Philadelphia, the pit-bull
count has soared from 25 to 4,000 in
five years. Time magazine reports the
animals are often fed gunpowder or
hot sauces to make them mean, live kit-
, tens to sharpen their taste for blood.
‘ Dogfighting is a felony in 36 states.
But the husky pit bulls, trained to fight
to the death, are being matched across
the nation. “It’s getting way out of
hand, man,” a pit-bull breeder told the
Los Angeles Times. “Compton, Ingle-
wood, Bakersfield, Hesperia. . .there
are at least three to four matches every
week, six— to 10-card fights.”

The Humane Society of the United
States reports that many pit bulls in-
volved in attacks on humans had been
, bred and trained for dogfights.

Pit bulls have become for many drug
dealers the weapon of choice —— legal
but more terrorizing than guns, ideal
for holding police at bay while an ille-
gal stash disappears down a toilet.

Baltimore police officer Bert Ricasa-

relates how a pit bull attacked and bit
him four times as he tried to arrest a
suspected narcotics dealer. Ricasa was
able to draw his service revolver and
pump several shots, point blank, into
the dog as it dug its teeth into his
thigh. But a colleague had to club the

dying dog on the head and then use a

San Francisco last month.

nightstick to pry its jaws loose. Rushed
to the emergency room, Ricasa re-
quired 400 stitches.

Who are these Rambos of the dog
world? The answer: A breed descended
from the fighting bulldogs of 19th Cen-
tury England, known as American pit-
bull terriers or American Stafford-
shire terriers. Some say they were ori-
ginally bred for bear—baiting. There
are some 700,000 to 1 million in the
United States. .

Dog-owner groups and kennel clubs
argue pit bulls aren’t the problem.
They say it’s humans who breed and
raise the animals improperly. They
echo the National Rifle Association
claim that its people, not guns, that
kill.

cious. The sole function of handguns is
killing. And bull terriers, however

amiable they appear, have a mark of

Cain in their genetic history: They
were first bred not to retrieve game or

The argument is facile but falla—

valid way to prove just which dog is a
pit bull. The very thought of bans
smacks, they say, of “canine racism.”
Torrance, Calif, council memberscon-
sidering a ban were accused of “at-
tempting to do to pit bulls the same
thing Hitler did to the Jews in Ger-
many.”

But it’s the rare pit-bull owner who
doesn’t know the breed’s killer his-
tory. Dogs aren’t entitled to constitu-
tional protections. Anyone’s legal
right to own a dangerous dog has to
stop short of his neighbor’s throat. The
real question is what kinds of curbs
will (1) restrain truly wild dogs and
(2) stand up in court? ‘

Here the dog clubs, backed by the
Humane Society, have a good argu-
ment: Instead of singling out pit bulls,
states and localities should strengthen
their “dangerous-dog” ordinances.
Typically, the laws require special reg-
istration, bonds and liability insur-
ance when a dog of any breed has a his-
tory of biting. On a second offense the
animal can be confiscated and the
owner fined or imprisoned.

A model .“dangerous-dog” bill, just
passed in Washington State, goes
further. Even before bites of humans
are recorded, it makes a dog’s aggres-
sive or intimidating behavior, includ-
ing attacks on other animals, a trip
wire for special controls.

There is a real question whether
“dangerous-dog” ordinances will deter
many of _ the back-alley types now
breeding'pit bulls for ill purpose. Or
that the laws will stop rural thugs like
the bunch in Grants Pass, Ore., recent- ‘
1y found to have 25 pit bulls chained
around their 2,345-plant marijuana
farm. ‘ , .

But South Pasadena dog owners
made a solid point in a recent letter to
the editor: “We Americans must be the
only people in the industrialized world
who stoically watch free-roaming dogs
ravage trash cans, terrorize children,
scare off natural wildlife, reproduce
rampantly, kill lawns with urine and‘
turn sidewalks into mine fields of fe-
ces.”

U.S. animal-control laws are a ne-
glected mess. The pit-bull attacks fit a
pattern of laxness. The message to lo-
cal governments is clamp down —— not
later, but now. .

better.

Social scientists and advocates of

their pet, feelings that they might
. nlot be“ able to share with anyone
e se.”

No wonder we spend billions of
dollars on dogs. Anything that
earns its keep by‘making us feel
loved and happy, anything that
understands us is always paid more
than something that merely fetches
the paper or bites strangers. ‘

Marshall Meyers, spokesman for
the Pet Industry Joint Advisory
Council, a trade association based
in Washington, says that in 1986
there were 51.6 million dogs in the
United States. While there is no
all-inclusive ﬁgure on what we
spend on their care and feeding,
Meyers says it is not only in the
billions of dollars but also “there is
more interest than ever before in
the upscale item.”

One indicator‘of this upscale
“interest was the success of Dogue,
a high—fashion parody of Vogue
magazine with an all-dog motif.
When Ilene Hochberg wrote
Dogue, she expected it to sell
20,000 copies. A year later it had
sold more than 200,000 copies (at
$8.95) and was still going strong.
Dogue, with it photos of mink-
coated poodles and collies in
tuxedos, was only partly joking.
Hochberg also produces a line of
clothes for dogs—Dogwear.

Terry Boyd,'president of the Pet
Industry Distributors Association,
sells 8,000 pet products at
wholesale from his Vista, Calif,
company, Lee—Mar Pet Supplies.
Increasingly, those products include
high-end speciality items.

“We’re seeing things like dog
sweaters and raincoats, dog toenail
polish and dog waterbeds,” Boyd
says. “Where retailers used to carry
:a basic leather leash, today
customers want ﬁne nylon leashes,
and in a spectrum of colors so they
can color-coordinate. If your dog
has'a red sweater you wouldn’t -
want to take him out in, public
' with a green leash.” ’

If the fashion sense of the pet
world has been raised, the property
value cf their homes has
skyrocketed. .

While the press brayed about the
exorbitance of Jim and Tammy
Bakker’s air-conditioned doghouse,
it might be considered just a shack
at Animal Manors, a New York
company that specializes in
elaborate handmade doghouses that
are more art pieces than doggie
condos

Animal Manors’ houses are
designed by architects,
custommade for individual dogs.
There is a French chateau for

poodles, a Swiss chalet with
hardwood ﬂoors for rustic dogs
and an English manor for
Sheepdogs. Some are tiled, some
carpeted and all have windows. '

A psychologist who specializes in
animal communications advises the
ﬁrm on the emotional and 4\
environmental needs of the animal;
helping to choose the appmpriate
scale, color and materials.

“Shy dogs want more enclosure, '
and relaxed dogs want more .
openness of design,” says Cannon
Garber, president of Animal
Manors.

“We have a ‘temple’ design that
is very airy, for example, and this
would not be right for a dog who
wants to retreat. It would be a
better house for a dog that likes
attention.”

While the personality of the pet
may vary, the ﬁnancial status of
the owners sheuld be gcid~eard
solvent. Animal Manors’ simplest
designs sell for $195, while the top-
of-the-line French chateau is
$1 1,000.

“Giving a dog a house that is
lovely is a way of thanking the pet
for physically and emotionally
helping the owner,” Garber says. “I
see the creation of special things
for animals as a way of recognizing
what they do for us.”

This need to recognize the canine
contribution to human well-being
ﬁnds expression in that classic
reward, the dog biscuit. Here, too,
the product has been reﬁned,
stripped of salt, sugar and additives
and turned into a healthful,
expensive, treat.

Linda Coffee has created what
might be the best dog biscuit in the
country, using only stone-ground
whole wheat, fresh garlic and
romano cheese. The biscuits are
sold through her shop, Haute
Canine, in Minneapolis, and
through Nordstrom’s department
stores and specialty shops
nationally. A lO—ounce bag sells for
$6, about four times the cost of
industry—leader Milk-Bone dog
biscuits, and, at $9 a pound, more
than ﬁlet mignon.

The Haute Canine biscuits are
packaged to appeal to your basic
BMW/Godiva chocolate
consumers. They come stacked
neatly in an elegant brown and
beige foil-lined bag that looks like
it would hold gourmet coffee
beans, the kind of bag that
product-designers call a “pouch.”
The wrapper has the letters “H”
and “C”——for Haute Canine—
repeated in an interlocking pattern,
giving the bag a look similar to
that found on products by

Christian Dior or Gucci.

“Our package does sell the owner
initially, but it’s the animals’ ,
response to the product that gives
us our repeat business,” Coffee
says. “Dogs love the ﬂavor of
cheese and garlic.” .

To make the dog—biscuit
experience complete, Fido should
wash it down with a cold bottle of
Oh Boy!~—-a beef-ﬂavored vitamin-
and-mineral-enriched “doggie
drink.” An ll-ounce, 69-cent
bottle "of Oh Boy!-—-—with its foil top
and green glass container—looks
like a bottle of imported beer. It’s.
the kind of drink a hard-working
Doberman would belt down after a
hard day guarding a nuclear power
plant.

Finally, we come to a pet
product that might surprise
people—~Martine and Christophe,
introduced in November, 1986,
“the ﬁrst designer fragrances for
the dog who has everything.” Dog
peri’iame. A 3.3—ounce French
crystal decanter of Martine (for
females) sells for $38.50;
Christophe cologne sells for $30.

Now, many would question why
dogs, which love to roll in garbage
and typically greet each other by
exchanging indiscreet sniffs, would
be interested in perfume made
from sandalwood and jasmine. The
answer, of course, is that dogs
couldn’t care less. But some owners
care a great deal.

“I deﬁnitely feel that these are
important products, not cutesy
little things,” says Lisa Gilford,
who conceived Martine and

. Christophe for her Le Chien

celebrity pet salon in New York.

“The fragrance is designed to
please the owner; the dog doesn’t
know if he smells good. But even if
the animal doesn’t know that he
smells good, he knows that he’s
clean and well taken care of.”

While the excesses of one dog
lover are just the basic necessities
of another, the consideration and
attention given to dogs speaks to
the value and comfort humans ﬁnd
in their pets. ' . '

“One good thing that I hope will
come out of our research,” says
Beck, “is that people will no longer
have to feel ashamed to care about
an animal. Someone who spends
$1,000 on a set of golf clubs is
considered a serious sportsman,
but spending $1,000 on a life-
saving operation for your dog is
considered wasteful. Lavishing care
on a pet is no more crazy than
paying a scalper $500 for a ticket
to a rock concert.”

Peterson said. “This is his brakes.”

“I know,” Meredith Adler, 9,

ued, and elicited a chorus of
“yeahs” from the other children.

“Nooo, not this time,” Peterson,

time we just let him walk.”
A flurry of questions, each an-
swered by Peterson, followed the

Everybody has heard the one
about the 5-year-old who put the cat
in the dryer, the gerbil that got
flushed down the toilet “to see
where he came out” or the puppy
who was put in the swimming pool.

Fixing that is all a matter of ed-
ucation -— a matter that was ad-
dressed on the first day of the pro-
gram.

“I learned that you don’t give
dogs chicken bones,” said Erica.
“It’s dangerous for them because

they can get stuck in their throat.”

“And we learned how to help
dogs if you find them, where to
bring them, and how to help them
out,” said Steven Vail.

“It’s really working,” Carol Full-
er, mother of Kristy, 6, added with
a groan. “She comes home now and
says, ‘Mommy, we have to clean
this dog dish,’ and “Mommy, we
can’t do that and we have to do
this.’ She’s really learning —— and so
am I.”

“We showed them pictures of
animals whose collars had grown in-
to their skin because they were too
tight, dogs that had no fur because
they had mange so bad, and other
things that could happen to any
pet,” Delperdang said. “Of course,
they’re fascinated by that stuff, any-
way, but I think they really learned
some things.

“Unfortunately, the program is
scheduled to be eliminated next

Day two of the Kindness Clinic
was spent on a tour of an area ani-
mal hospital and day three was
spent touring the Humane Society
building at 3607 N. Armenia Ave.,
Tampa, where the children learned
about responsible and irresponsible
acts of pet ownership.

“The shelter can be a very
heartbreaking place, especially this
time of year,” Delperdang said.
“We talked about how the pets are
cute, but that there are just too
many of them. In May alone, we
took in 1,500 cats and kittens.”

Many of those have to be put to
sleep.

“Yes, we talked about that,” Del-
praney says. “We didn’t dwell on it,
but we explained that there just
aren’t enough homes. The children

react as we do -— it makes them-

mad that we don’t take care of our
animals. But unless people know
about the problems, they’re never
going to be solved.

of kindness and responsibility in
children at this age, so that hopeful-

ly we will create a better class of _

HIALEAH - A priest at the
city’s first public Santeria church
said Sunday he is ready to go to
court and fight a recent ruling that
says ritual animal sacrifice is ille-
ga . .

The Iglesia Lukumi Babalu-Aye
has been plagued by controversy
since moving to Hialeah in March.
The dispute surfaced again last
week with an official Opinion by
state Attorney General BObButter~

worth that said animal sacrifices, '

an integral part of Santeria, is ille-
gal.
Ernesto Pichardo, priest at the

300—member church, said he is pre— -

pared to fight the Opinion in court.
liialeah Mayor Raul Martinez said
is willing to meet Pichardo in
dourt.

' rﬁc discrimination tone, and inter-
rest on the owner’s land,” said Pi-
chardo. “They’re using the issue in

“This is total politics,” said Mar-

Martinez said Julio Navarro,
who owns the property, supports an
Opposition candidate for mayor. .

Pichardo said Martinez and oth-
er city officials are using the issue
to gain public support.

“How do you target something
like this? You talk about chickens,”
he said. “It’s sensational. It gets at-
teation.”

For four months the Afro-Cuban
religion has been trying to convert
a two-story house into a church. So
far, the work has been delayed by
opponents, who claim church mem-
bers practice witchcraft and ani-
mal mutilation.

Church officials say Santeria is a
legitimate religion, founded more
than 2,000 years ago and practiced
by about 50,000 mph in the Mi-

ATLANTA JOURNAL/CONSTITUTION - July 26, 1987

TheNew York Times

MEXICO CITY -— Mexico has

. become the hub for the smuggling

of millions of dollars worth of rare
and often endangered wildlife into

the United States.

American officials and Mexican
conservation groups who have
watched the rise of professional
rings of wildlife smugglers attribute
the illegal traffic to a porous bor-
der, ineffective law enforcement
and the appeal of enormous profits.

In a manifesto issued earlier
this summer, a coalition of Mexican
conservation groups said that the
“plundering” of bird, reptile and fe-
line species on the verge of extinc-
tion has reached “scandalous levels”
here because of the “inexplicable
apathy” and “indifference of the
competent authorities.” U.S. offi-
cials, while reluctant to blame their
Mexican counterparts, say Mexico
has become a clearinghouse for
trafficking in rare and endangered
species from as far away as South-

east Asia.

“Mexico is just an Open door,”
Jerome Smith, deputy chief of the
Division of Law Enforcement at the
United States Fish and Wildlife Ser-
vice, said from Washington. “With a
border that is extremely long, basi-

«, cally unprotected and easy to cross, ..

it’s like a funnel pouring wildlife,

skins and other animal products into

Bare species bring high prices on US. market *

the United States.”

Smith said the value of the traf-
fic in rare and endangered wildlife
between the United States and for-
eign countries was $300 million to
$400 million a year. He said Mexico
was “the major source of the smug-
gled wildlife” entering the United
States and was active in illegal
shipments of protected species to
Western Europe and the Middle
East.

“Right now, we know there are
two to three hundred palm cocks..-
toos being held somewhere along
the border, probably in Tijuana, just
waiting for a chance to come over,”
Smith said. “Because these birds
are so rare and hardly ever breed
in captivity, you can get $8,000 to
$10,000 a bird, and much more for
a bonded pair.”

Smith said the palm ceckatoo
was native only to Indonesia, Papua
New Guinea and Australia. He said
birds were recently shipped “right
through the Mexico City airport”
because of Mexico’s closeness to the
American market and the loOpholes
in law enforcement here. “Some of
the birds have already come into
the US, but we are hoping to stop
the rest,” he said.

In another case, a two-year un-
dercover Operation run by the Fish
and Wildlife Service out of Dallas

people, including seven Mexicans.
All were charged with involvement
in smuggling more than 250 parrots

of protected species. The birds were

sold to Americans at up to $2,500
each.

In announcing the arrests, the
Fish and Wildlife Service said that
“various illegal Mexican wholesale
suppliers, wholesale dealers and in-
dividuals” had acted as transporters
for the smuggled birds. Some of the
Mexican sources “implied they
could supply 200 to 300 illegal par-
rots per week,” wildlife officials
added. ' .

Fish and Wildlife officials say

, about 50,000 rare parrots enter the

United States illegally from Mexico
each year, often bringing disease

with them. Smith said there were.

“dozens of animal dealers” in Mexi~

co engaged in the smuggling of live l

snakes, tarantulas, desert sheep,
pickled turtle eggs, lizard skin boots
and pelts of spotted cats. '

i

Efforts to halt the trade, which i

is dominated by rings of profession-
al smugglers, have been complicat-
ed by Mexico’s unwillingness to sign
the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Flora and Fauna. The United
States and nearly 100 other nations,
including every other major country
in the Western Hemisphere, have
accepted the convention, which for-
bids commerce in some species a1-
together and strictly limits trade in
others. '

AT THE SAN DIEGO ZOO, ﬂamingos
eat shrimp and crayﬁsh, which help
them maintain their pink color. Koalas
like 16 different kinds of Australian eu-
calyptus, grown in special browsing
areas just for them. “Fat, sassy koalas
usually won’t touch anything that’s
fallen to the ground,” says zoo spokes-
person Chris Peterson. Komodo drag-
ons devour pigeons whole, and mon-
keys get only those bananas that are
perfectly ripe and slightly brown; oth-
erwise they might get stomachaches.

Life is good for animals at the San
Diego Zoo, where diets are planned
carefully in accordance with the most
up-to-date concepts about nutrition.

“Would you feed leftovers to a Si-
berian tiger worth thousands of dol—
lars?” asks tour-guide Ken Young as
he leads Visitors around the 100—acre
zoo in Balboa Park. A sleek, quiet
monorail slides around curves and
through ﬁelds, providing glimpses of
nearly 4,000 animals browsing, rest-
ing, and running free. There are 3, 500
more animals in the Wild Animal Park
on a site northwest of San Diego.

“The zoo buys more fresh fruits and
vegetables than any other 200 in the
world,” Mr. Young says. “[In 1985,] we
distributed 3, 420 pounds of fresh blue—
berries and 24,480 Hawaiian papayas,
mostly to the birds and primates,” says
warehouse manager Dan Fry.

In fact, 24 percent of the 1985 food
budget of $519,904 went for fresh
fruits and vegetables, including broc-
coli, cabbage, carrots (none with
bumps), celery, corn on the cob, kale,
romaine lettuce (which has more food
value than other kinds), onions, par-
sley, spinach, tomatoes, apples, ba-
nanas, grapes, oranges, plantains, and
sweet potatoes.

Some 510 pounds of dried white Ka-
dota ﬁgs and 3,075 pounds of raisins
are also on the grocery list, along with
86 gallons of apricot nectar. Special
treats one year included 10 tons of an-
chovies, 150 pounds of quail eggs, 60
pounds of bee pollen, and 715,000
cn'ckets.

Health foods are important at the
zoo where brown rice, barley, yogurt,
English walnuts, sunﬂower seeds, and
peanut butter are staples. And human
baby food (3,456 jars in 1985) is pop-
ular with newborns.

But the real prima donnas are the
birds, who are quite greedy and given
to vociferous complaining even when
they aren’t hungry. Lorikeet hatch-

'Diets are determined by commit—
:ees of nutritionists, veterinarians,
physiologists, and pathologists. Keep-
ers constantly observe and report an—
mal behavior, appetite, and general
condition. “Proper diet can prevent
serious health problems in animals,”
says Dr. M. T. Anderson, director of
pathology. He continues:

“We noticed a swayback condition
in a wapiti deer, probably from a cop—
per deﬁciency. The culprit was too
much molybdenum in the hay; it drives
out copper. The condition disappeared
when we devised a different feed.”

with bread and honey. Balky lizards
gobble up crickets dusted with a ﬁne
mix of powdered vitamins. Sea lions
get vitamins mixed with squid. A go—
rilla with a sore throat gets human
cough medicine in a glass of soda. But
if all else fails, the keeper feeds it to
the ape with a spoon.

Diet affects dental hygiene in ani-
mals, too. In 1985, 100 root canals
were performed on zoo animals. One
gorilla had such bad teeth it needed
oral surgery and reconstructive
bridgework. For some animals, chew-
ing branches of acacia trees and bam-
boo helps keep teeth healthy. Tigers
and lions get oxtails and bones to
munch on. Stalks from banana trees
are coarse enough for gorillas to pull
through their teeth like dental ﬂoss.

All this attention to diet is wasted
when visitors ignore prohibitions and
feed the animals. Necropsies (animal
autopsies) have revealed ﬂash cubes,
open safety pins, and sticks in animals’
stomachs. One unfortunate harbor
seal, who was especially efﬁcient at
vacuuming up the bottom of the pool,
died after ingesting 278 coins.

But despite the dangers of such in-
terference, the zoo staff is largely suc-
cessful in keeping its charges eating
well. Indeed, San Diego Zoo animals
probably eat more nutritiously than
many of their human visitors. \’

 




BOSTON GLOBE — July 21, 1987

Mexico City: a Paris for pandas?

By Philip Bennett
Globe Staff

EXICO CITY -— For all its vir—

. tues, the capital of Mexico is

_. thought to be among the most

crowded polluted and noisy

cities in the world. Most days, you can find

the 20 million people who live here engaged

in a ritual scramble to hustle an extra job,

navigate death-defying traffic and general—

ly survive the chaos of a modern‘metropolis
trapped in the body of an ancient city.

Whether giant pandaSAenjoy all this is a
matter of speculation. Yet at the Chapulte-
pec Zoo, in the heart of Mexico City’s smog
belt. members of the fragile and occasional-
ly neurotic species continue to surprise spe-

cialists by reproducing at a rate unknown
outside their Chinese homeland.

Chapultepec is the only zoo outside of
China to naturally breed giant pandas.
Last month, while officials at the National
Zoo in Washington mourned the deaths of
two newborn panda cubs there, a panda
here named Ying Ying successfully gave
birth to twins. One of the cubs later died,
but its healthy sibling went on to join three
sisters born and raised in the zoo since
1981.

No one seems certain why pandas, with
a reputation as extraordinarily moody ani-
mals, have thrived in the midst of the
world’s largest urban center. Zoo officials
here attribute the species's fecundity to a
set of bizarre factors ranging from unusual
care at Chapultepec to the capital's oxygen
starved air, which is said to resemble the
animals’ natural mountain habitat.

Some even say, with a hint of a smile at
a standard Mexican joke, that it might b‘
the water.

Despite its success. the Chapultepec
'breeding. program seems to have been
largely ignored by other zoos. Zookeepers
here say that their unconventional prac-
tices. including feeding the pandas a con-
troversial homemade diet and refusing to
submit the animals to artificial insemina-
tion. have been greeted with ridicule from
foreign animal experts.

“They make fun of us." said Marielena
Hoyo. the 200’s director. “No other zoo has
ever asked us how wedo it. They’ve never
invited us to see their pandas, and never

asked to come see ours. We’re willing to

share any secret 'of success. and it's not
luck.”

Reﬂection of her style

For several local zoo watchers, one of .

the leading secrets is Hoyo herself. At 34,
she is the first woman director of a Mexi-
can 200 in the country’s history. Her un-
usual odyssey into the wild kingdom is

credited with transforming Chapultepec

from a troubled facility into a reflection of
her own energetic and, at times. eccentric
style.

Since the early 19208, the Chapultepec
Zoo has been a oasis for Mexico City resi-
dents, especially poorer families escaping
the city’s slums to Chapultepec Park on
weekends and holidays. By some accounts,
1.5 million people visit the park each week-
end. On ritual outings. they picnic in the
shade outside the zoo and crowd its
grounds among organ grinders and hun-
dreds of vendors selling tacos. popsicles,
and plastic toys. Children ride an aging
minature train.

Admission to the zoo, like entry to most
of Mexico City’s cultural attractions. is
free. Exact figures are not kept of the num-
ber of people passing through its gates, but
officials claim that on Sunday afternoons
there are more visitors in the Chapultapec
Zoo than at any other 200 in the world.

When Hoyo was named director four
years ago, there were also serious prob-
lems. Animal handlers were known to steal
steaks meant for large cats. Young animals.
mysteriously disappeared and were discov-
ered on the open market for sale to other
zoos or private Collectors.

As a woman without formal training in
zoology, whose only prior experience was in
a children’s zoo, Hoyo also found a less
than cooperative staff. In the days follow-
ing her appointment, zoo gardeners and
animal handlers gathered with a tequila
bottle every afternoon to serenade their
new boss outside her office.

"We’re going to catch the little girl.” she
remembers them singing, “and throw her
off a cliff.”

“I think they gave me about a month
here," she said this week, dressed in over-
alls and a Bloom County Sweatshirt. “You

have to be tough to run a zoo and doubly

tough if you’re a woman. I‘m doubly
tough."

Sets standard for informality

Since her arrival, Hoyo has set some-
thing of a standard for informality and di-
rectness among Mexican bureaucrats. She
fires unproductive workers. She is seen reg-
ularly talking to animals. And members of
her staff say that she has encouraged them
to develop unconventional ways of han-
dling rare species.

In the case of the pandas, Hoyo and vet-
erinarian Juan Tellez have broken with
tradition by feeding the animals a rare diet
that includes diced chicken, spinach. su-
gar, carrots and an occasional milkshake.
So controversial is the regimen that'two
years ago. a visiting Chinese dignitary had
to be subdued after screaming at the 200’s

‘staff that the food would kill the animals.

Since 1972, when giant pandas were
first allowed to leave 'China for the West, ‘
zoos in London, Madrid. Washington and
Tokyo have had pandas give birth through
artificial insemination, but only the cub in
Spain has survived. By comparison, four
healthy panda cubs have been bred natu-
rally in Chapultepec. Three other newborn
pandas have died here.

Hoyo suggested that the failure of other
zoos might be due to what she called overly
protective mothering of the animals.

“Abroad, the pandas are very technical-
ly managed. They’re told when to eat,
when to sleep. like little children who are
ordered to clean their room,” she said. “If

~ they left them alone, perhaps they’d have

better luck. But. hey. at the other zoos
they’d probably say, who's this idiot telling
us what to do?"

Chapultepec also boasts breakthroughs
in breeding other rare species. including
the first Andean Condor to be born in capi-
tivity. But Hoyo said she is worried that the
expansion of the panda family may be cut
short. The father of all four cubs here and
the only male panda. Fe Fe. is close to
death from old age. The 200’s requests for
another male panda have not been an-
swered.

“Pe Pe could die any day now, and we’ re
still waiting. " Hoyo said. “'We d like to see
him become a grandfather before he goes.’

DODGE CITY, Kan. — It; a motel room

Rafael “Rafaelillo” Gil .placed a tiny
bronze elephant and a lock of his dangh-
ter’s hair on a dresser. Good-luck charms,
he explained. ’

Then, Rafaelillo, who has been gored 20
times, including once through the jaw,
dealt out a stack of cards with novenas
and illustrations of saints printed on
them. Above these went a candle and a

' picture of the Virgin of Guadalupe.

“I’m afraid of the bull, but more afraid

'of putting on a bad show,” he said.

Later that evening, Rafaelillo brought
a cheering crowd of several thousand,

mostly Anglo, spectators to its ,feetin an . . .
unusual Fourth of ulycelebration. '

For the third time in four years, he and "

his colleagues showed Dodge City that
bullfighting is an electrifying ‘sport.
More important for the Hispanic minor-
ity here, the bull ring has become an
arena for cultural exchange.

“Before, I thought bullfighting was
kind of a fraud,” said Kimberley
Kirchmer, a teaching assistant at a
school where many students are children
of Mexican migrant workers. “But I
learned it’s an art, a skill.”

She, like many other Anglos who at-
tended the bullfights here last weekend,
also said the performances were a source
of pride for Mexican-Americans.

After the matadors appeared at her
school for a special assembly, Kirchmer
said she noticed theHispanic children
walking with their heads held higher.

“There’s a kind of bonding with all of

Dodge City during the bullfights,” local

Kiwanian Tom Scott said.

Bullfighting as performed in Spain and
Mexico is illegal in the United States. The
bloodless, Portuguese-style version pre-
sented in Dodge is less gruesome but
more, dangerous. - g

“In this kind of fight, the bull has the ,
advantage,” explained Raquel Martinez, -'

V .the world’s only professional female “ma-

tadora.” In Mexico, “picas,” small darts,

are inserted in the bull’s neck to slow its

pace. That practice is banned here.
Matadors must face the unmitigated

fury of bulls bred and raised at Mexican

ranches for the fight.
Traditional bullfights end after the

‘ tion of the bull with a series of perilously '

i matador demonstrates complete domina-
I‘-

25 close passes using a small cape called a

““7“ w--rv< x< -

“muletta.” Then, the matador executes
the animal with a sword jabbed into its
spinal column.

U.S. bullfights end more peacefully.

" When the bull learns the trick of the

cape and begins charging directly 'at the
body, he is corralled from the ring.
For the matador, the possibility of
bloodletting is undiminished. '
Fighting bulls are smaller than their
rodeo brethren, with sharper horns. that
can plunge fatally into the body. The
horns commonly fracture hands and
ribs. '
. Paco Olivera received a hematoma in
his right leg over the weekend when a

bull standing inches taller than the mata-

dorvcharged with a bowed head.

Tony Falcon, a Hispanic who serves on
the committee sponsoring the event, de-
scribed the community as racially
united. .

But the Hispanics here are predomi.
nantly poor. Many work in the town’s tWO
large meat processing plants, which sti-
fle the air with a sweet-putrid odor on

hot afternoons.

The bullfight was a colorful spectacle
that harkens back to the town’s glory
days, when it was a notorious stop along
the Santa Fe Trail. Today it is a tidy
community of 21,000, with a Wal-Mart and
subdivisions. Much of the red-bricked
downtown district is mailed.

placed the‘infamous pauper’s cemetery,

At Roundup Arena last weekend, the
spirit of the old Dodge prevailed.

The city turned parking lots into prac-
tice arenas for the six matadors.

stars by admiring autograph hounds.

The feeling was clearly mutual.

DEKALB NEWS/SUN (Atlanta) - July 29, 1987

By STEVE TEASLEY

No pit bull terriers materialized
Tuesday at DeKalb’s commission
meeting. ' '

Neither did a new law banning
pit bulls.

Both had been expected...

The commissioners -— in a 5-2
vote - refused to remove from the
“table” a previously tsiiled ordi-
nance that would outlaw the pit
bull breed in DeKalb.

Technically, that means the
issue is dead unless — or until — at
least two board members change
their minds. ‘ .

The proposed ban had been re-
vived by Commissioner John
Evans, whs Tuesday cited numer-
ous pit bull attacks on humans in
DeKalb and around the countrv as
the reason for his'request.

Courthouse observers were ec-
ulating before the meeting that the
measure might pass.

But, Commissioner Brince Man-
ning was the only board member
who supported the Evans motion to
bring the matter off the table for
consideration.

DEKALB CHIEF Executive Of-
. ﬁcer Manuel Maloof, anticipating
that some protesting pit bull own-
ers might show up at Tuesday’s
session — with their pit bulls -—
had last Saturday issued an execu»
tive order banning almost all dogs
from county property.

He excluded seeing eye dogs.

Copies of the order were posted
on the county auditorium doors
Tuesday. But, no pit bulls showed
up for the session.

A number of people interested in
the Evans’ plan did appear, how-
ever. And, one spoke to the board
after the vote, congratulating the
commission on its decision and
expressing her faith _in the

county’s existing “dangerous ani-
mal” ordinance.

The dangerous animal law,
passed earlier this year when the
pit bull ban was initially tabled,
regulates the way owners of any
dangerous dog. must maintain
those animals.

TUESDAY, ME: EVANS said
he wanted the current law ex-
panded to make it “unlawful to
keep, own or possess any pit bull
dog.” He alluded to the many
recent, well-publicized attacks by
that breed on humans. Three pit
bulls killed a four-year-old DeKalb
boy last November.

The District 3 commissioner crit-
icized the makeup of a citizens .
committee that came up with the
dangerous animal law earlier this
year, claiming the commission-ap-
pointed panel was unbalanced in
favor of dog owners, trainers and
showers.

That charge was later chal- .
lenged by Mr. Maloof, Commis-
sioner Jean Williams and a mem-
ber of the committee who spoke to
the board. They all argued that the
advisory body was balanced with
different views on animal control.

Mr. Evans called the proposed
pit bull ban “a matter of princi-
ple...the whole issue is how we are
concerned about human beings as
opposed to dogs.”

He challenged county animal
control ofﬁcers to point to any
other breed of dog that’s killed a
human being, and he tried to get
an ofﬁcer to admit that the pit bull
is the most deadly of canine
breeds. The unidentiﬁed animal
control expert would agree that the ,
pit bull has .“stronger jaws, and ‘
the bite goes deeper.” But, he said ,

he believes German Shepherds, I
'Dobermans and other breeds “have

the same propensity” to attack.
Nevertheless, Mr. Evans said, '
“IfI had to be bitten, and I had a

choice, I would not pick a pit bull.”

Commissioner Jean Williams

:cited a list of local dog attacks the

past year-and-a-half, showing that
pit bulls are far below other breeds .
in the number of reported bites of

' humans. ‘

’fJohn Evans‘ Pit Bull Ban Attempt
Was Second For Him This Year

By KAYE RAWLS

When DeKalb Commissioner
John Evans announced in a July
21 board work session that he
would try for a law outlawing pit
bull terriers in DeKalb, it marked
the second attempt he’s launched
in that direction this year.

Both have failed. Last spring,
the commission opted for a “dan-
gerous animal” law, taking in all
breeds.

And, 'Iﬁiesday, the commission
voted, 5- 2, against taking the pit
bull proposal “off the table” for

further consideration.
L —,But both in the work session a
week ago and in Tuesday’s meet-
mg, the district 3 commissioner
‘ fspoke for the ban with conviction.
,' At the July 21 meeting, Evans
said he would also like to see the
*current animal control ordinance
.i‘ewritten to allow dogs which
', neighbors frequently make com-
' iplaints against categorized as “vi-
cious” before they actually bite a
person.

a DeKalb County Attorney Sid
Johnson, who earlier this year had
questioned the constitutionality of
’ -a ban on pit bull dogs in the
county, now says recent court deci-
sions have somewhat legitimatized
‘bans on particular breeds of dogs.

"I “I do know there has been a
, slight trend toward upholding ordi-
- ﬁnances of this nature - banning a
species. I emphasize a slight trend
because a few months ago, our ﬁrst
research indicated that the bans
"were not being upheld,” Johnson
said, in the work session, adding
“that that situation had changed
somewhat in recent months.

3New Statewide Coalition

i

By VIVIAN PRICE
DeKalb dog owners are attempting to lead the way to bringing some

sanity, they say, back into the vicious animal controversy.
“We are in the process of forming a statewide coalition of dog

clubs,” said DeKalb resident Maria Zorka. The ﬁrst meeting is set for

Thursday, Aug. 6.
Zorka continued, “It is easy to taunt an animal like that, and

“An animal should not be roped or chained in lieu of a fence,” Zorka
said. “An animal can break a chain or a rope. It is difficult to delegate to
people how secure the rope or chain has to be. There are no specifications ,
animals can strangle while tied.”

will be kept busy explaining why the
product they manufacture and sell should not be
called a casket but a “pet burial kit.”

In the ﬁrst place, the product is a kit. It includes
the unmentionable object itself, a satin lining,
sealant, a pressure-sensitive-name tag and a card
inscribed “Our Deepest Sympathy” containing
burial instructions and suggestions for a pet
memorial service, for handling grief and for
explaining death to children.

More important, as Michael McCormack
explained on the eve of the convention, is that the
1 word casket is associated with “morbidity and

people’s aversion to death.” "
’ “Because our product is designed especially for
- back-yard use—pet owners will be handling the
. unit themselves—we wanted to get away from the
i association with human burial,” he said.

same reason, the satin liner, which people put in
themselves, is not the rufﬂy type of lining we see p

It was not news to McCormack that Casket itself ~
is a euphemism for coffin, just as cemetery began
as a euphemism for graveyard. In both cases the
grinning face of reality shone through, as often

happens. Only last year the McCormacks’

innocuous “kit” was a “pet burial receptacle.”
‘ The McCormacks conceived of the product two

years ago at Christmastime. “We had three pets’

deaths in our close family,” McCormack explains.
They discovered that pet caskets were available
from pet cemeteries but not from veterinarians,

pet groomers and pet shops.

Says MichaelMcCormack: “There are an awful ’
lot of communities that don’t have a pet cemetery s
gracmg their City limits. So we thought there was a ‘

great void out there.”

Cruelty to Sharks

I read “Man-Eating Shark, Shark-
Eating Man Vie in Fierce Competi-
tion” [July 5] with much sadness and
outrage. The fishermen described in

' sportsmen and hunters; their meth-
ods are sadistic and inhumane. It is
, one thing to have a fair fight with a
' game fish and emerge the Victor,
quite another to win after one has
’ overpowered the animal through a
combination of beating and torture.

Such contests do not prove what
skilled fishermen these men are; rath-
er, they prove how frail their manh-
ness is. Real men do not have to kill

an animal slowly in an unfair fight.
Throughout history people have
‘ mistreated either innocent animals or
weaker human beings rather than
face their own failings—thus the

are poor excuses for'

the shark has become oneof several
scapegoats. Few people Vilify wolves,
bears and large cats for being strong
hunters that rely on sharp teeth to kill
their prey, but they attribute all sorts
of evil motives to sharks. Whether
one believes in God or not, the fact is
that no human being created this

body, taught him to SWlm or put sharp
teeth in his mouth. . .

Canine overkill ”

MY LETTER concerns all the
hype about pit bullterriers. Everyone

I have heard so far says destroy‘
the entire breed. Well, I have also,

heard stories of Dobermans, Ger-
man sheperds, chows and numer—

ous other breeds of dogs attacking ’

people. We owned a pit bull that
was a big “lap dog” with the swee—
test diSposition of any dog I have
ever seen. She did, however, keep

intruders and other animals out of ,

our yard.

I am aware there 15 a problem“

with pit bull attacks. I simply feel
we could ﬁnd a better solution. Pit
bulls are not born with a “killer
instinct.” Their owner has to put
that into them. Maybe we should
look into some way of disciplining
the owners instead of the animals.

One ﬁnal thought. Why should
we kill a dog for something we
teach him to do and he doesn’t
understand when a man can 'kill
someone knowing full well what
he is doing, go to jail for maybe
ﬁve years and then be back out on
the Street?

All-American Dog
:Saved His Life

3

Norman Chastain of Decatur is
ltired of hearing all the stories
iabout dogs ‘who turn vicious and
'hurt people.

’ He wants to know that a dog is
his best friend. In fact, he thinks
this dog should get a medal. Chas-
tain hasn’t seen Duke in years and
doesn’t know if he’s still alive. He
only knows Duke saved his life,
three times in less than a month.
. Chastain, who was in the Coast
Guard during World War II, was
on beach patrol near 'Freeport,
Texas, all three times Duke saved
him.

The ﬁrst time Chastain and an-
~ other seaman stumbled on a cow

and her newborn calf, with a huge
Brahma bull standing guard be-
_' side them. .
Suddenly the bull charged Chas-
tain. He ordered Duke to attack,
and the fearless dog tore at the
bull’s throat. But the huge beast
. tossed Duke to the side, circled and

use TED/er

charged again. _Chastain’s compan-
ion felled the bull with a machine
gun blast.

Another time, Duke steered
Chastain away from a rattlesnake,
lunged at the snake, nabbed it
behind the head, shook it dead and
laid it at his feet.

The third time, Duke saved
Chastain from being trampled to
death. Chastain was lying on the
beach at night when Duke sud-
denly jumped up and dragged
Chastain toward the water.

“Then I heard snorting and a
faint rumbling coming down the
beach,” Chastain said. “It was a
huge herd of horses. I rushed out
into the water up to my neck and
Duke swam around me until the
last horse passed.” . ‘ '

Loyalty and training made the
difference, Chastain said. “Duke
was trained properly by the US.
Coast Guard to help protect us
while at war.”

officers agreed yesterday that laws aimed
at the dogs are notthe best solution.

Nonetheless, the group discussed ways to
make such laws as effective as possible.

The animal control officers grappled with
the problem at a Concord meeting of the Cali-
fornia Animal Control Directors’ Association.

On the one hand, they said, laws singling
out pit bulls will be hard to enforce and may
face tough challenges in the courts.

Politicians‘Seek laws

 

However, local politicians, caught up in

the pit bull panic, are asking their animal '

experts to draft laws aimed only at pit bulls.

“Every dog that’s running loose that used
to be a brown dog is now a brown pit bull, ” said
Diane Iwasa, director of Contra Costa County
Animal Control.

The foremost problem with pit bull laws,

the group agreed, is that pit bull is a generic
name, not a breed. That 18 why it is difficult to
describe the animal in terms that will stand up
in court.

Concentrating on pit bulls may just lead »

‘ owners to camouflage their dogs. Already,
dogs previously registered as pit bull mixes are

' ' being re- ~registered to list some other element
'ef the mix first and erase any mention of pit'

bull.

Most members of the group favored tight-
ening existing laws that regulate all dangerous
animals, regardless of breed, as a more practi-
cal and reliable way to get at the pit bull
problem. '

Paul Ash, operations director of the San

Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruel-
ty to Animals, said San Francisco supervisors
favor that route.

Features of laws

 

However, most officers said that they have

been charged with drafting pit bull-specific

laws, so the group discussed what features
such laws should contain.

The most dramatic law on pit bulls was
adopted by the city of Livingston, population
6,600. The city in Merced County set up an
elaborate registration program for pit bulls,
including two color mug shots of the dogs. The
law also prohibits any new pit bulls in town.

Most animal control officers agreed yes-
terday that although such a ban may work in a
small town, it is not practical in large cities.

Leonard Maitland, Fremont’s animal con-
trol director, said he would like a law that
would enable animal control officers to deal
with dangerous dogs before trouble starts.

 

 

“w. .a—.1 , 4 1'. .. rvg m w

The dog tied up on private property that . .'

killed a 2- year old Mor gan llill boy earlier this -' ~,

year “was an accident, waiting to happen,’
Maitland said.

“Do we want to allow the public to have a
dog on their front property that is restrained
but has access to the public as they approach?"
he asked.

One suggestion was that new laws be pass-
ed giving animal control officers more authori-
ty to enter private: property and to seize ani- ‘5'
mals reported to be dangerous.‘

Special Collar Suggested

 

Val Wood, director of Animal Control for.
Sacramento County, suggested a special, fluor-
escent collar for all pit bulls that would alert
the public to the dog’s potential threat. "

Similarly, lwasa said her department may
recommend that all pit bull owners post a

‘ symbol, like a red stop sign with a dog silhou—

ette inside, to alert passers- -by to the pit bull’s ‘

' presence.

However, Jewel Smith, animal control di-
rector for El Dorado County, said, “until you
make the owner financially responsible for the

pit bull, you’re not going to solve the problem.” '.

Dan DeMiglio of the US. Postal Service
agreed, noting that pit bull attacks on mail
carriers fell dramatically afterthe Postal Ser- f
vice began encouraging carriers to sue dog
owners. ., 1 k

‘ ,Movie House Hires a Dog
To Patrol Aisles for Tremble

Associated Press

Jackson, Miss.

Managers of a movie the-
ater plagued by rowdy teenage.

gang members have hired an

armed guard to patrol the aisles '

with a trained guard dog.

The armed officer, with a Do- "

barman pinscher named “Strider”

on a leash by his side, appeared at
the Jackson Mall Cinema for the"

first time in June.

“I really believe the dog has
calmed them down. They know he’s '

not there to play tricks because he

has a muzzle on,” said Phillip Clark, ,
district supervisor for United Cine-'

theater.

On weekend nights. 300 to 600

 

people frequent the theater, Clark
said, and as many as 75 percent are 1'
gang members.

“Other kids tell you who the

gang members are andthe mall’s
, security officers, too,” he said.

“They don’t keep it a secret as to
who they are.”

Before the dog was there to
help keep order, theater managers
threw out five to 10 people every
Friday and Saturday night, Clark
said. That number has fallen sharp-

ly.

On a recent Saturday, only;
three people were removed and'

3John Evans' Pit Bull Ban Attempt
Was Second For Him This Year

By KAYE RAWLS

When DeKalb Commissioner
John Evans announced in a July
21 board work session that he
would try for a law outlawing pit
Bull terriers in DeKalb, it marked
the second attempt he’s launched

that direction this year.

Both have failed. Last spring,
Lille commission opted for a “dan-
gerous animal” law, taking in all
breeds.

And, Tuesday, the commission
voted, 5- 2, against taking the pit
bull proposal “off the table” for
ﬂirther consideration.’

But, both in the work session a
week ago and in Tuesday’s meet-
Ving, the district 3 commissioner
{iii‘spoke for the ban with conviction.
"3' At the July 21 meeting, Evans

said he would also like to see the
~current animal control ordinance
niewritten to allow dogs which
’ neighbors frequently make com-
' iplaints against categorized as “vi-
cious” before they actually bite a
person

.. DeKalb County Attorney Sid
Johnson, who earlier this year had
-- questioned the constitutionality of
’ a ban on pit bull dogs in the
' county, now says recent court deci-
f- dions have somewhat legitimatized

because a few months ago, our ﬁrst

said, in the work session, adding

“The only problem with that is

joked commissioner Brince Man-

Evans, who says the issue has
not been resolved to his satisfac-
tion, claims the matter is one of

“principle” for him.

Pit owners, however, say Evans
and others who would ban any
particular breed of dogs are react-
ing irrational and offer no objec-
tive proof that such a case can be
made against pits.

And testimony by other commis-
sioners gave some credence to that

say, to sufficiently patrol the

DeKalb dog owners are attempting to lead the way to bringing some

DEKALB NEWS/SUN (Atlanta) - July 29, 1987

By STEVE TEASLEY

No pit bull terriers materialized
Tuesday at DeKalb’s commission
meeting. ‘

Neither did a new law banning
pit bulls.

Both had been expected...

The commissioners — in a 5-2
vote —— refused to remove from the
“table” a previously tabled ordi-
nance that would outlaw the pit
bull breed in DeKalb.

Technically, that means the
issue is dead unless — or until — at
least two board members change
their minds. ' _

The proposed ban had been re-
vived by Commissioner John
Evans, who Tuesday cited numer-
ous pit bull attacks on humans in
DeKalb and around the countrv as
the reason for his‘request. '

Courthouse observers were .. , ec-
ulating before the meeting that the
measure might pass.

But, Commissioner Brince Man-
ning was the only board member
who supported the Evans motion to
bring the matter off the table for
consideration.

DEKALB CHIEF Executive Of-
. ﬁcer Manuel Maloof, anticipating
that some protesting pit bull own-
ers might show up at Tuesday’s
session — with their pit bulls -
had last Saturday issued an execu»
tive order banning almost all dogs
from county property.

He excluded seeing eye dogs.

Copies of the order were posted
on the county auditorium doors

Tuesday. But, no pit bulls showed
up for the session.

. 'A number of people interested in
the Evans’ plan did appear, how-
ever. And, one spoke to the board
after the vote, congratulating the
commission on its decision and
expressing her faith .in the

- ' ,..

(1.
'.-’.
. vii. ' '
.4). v “M-
.

county’s existing “dangerous ani-
mal” ordinance.

The dangerous animal law,
passed earlier this year when the
pit bull ban was initially tabled,
regulates the way owners of any
dangerous dog must maintain
those animals.

TUESDAY, MFL EVANS said
he wanted the current law ex-
panded to make it “unlawful to
keep, own or possess any pit bull
dog.” He alluded to the many
recent, well-publicized attacks by
that breed on humans. Three pit
bulls killed a four-year-old DeKalb
boy last November.

The District 3 commissioner crit-

icized the makeup of a citizens .

committee that came up with the
dangerous animal law earlier this
year, claiming the commission-ap-
pointed panel was unbalanced in
favor of dog owners, trainers and
showers.

That charge was later chal- ,

lenged by Mr. Maloof, Commis-
sioner Jean. Williams and a mem-
ber of the committee who spoke to
the board. They all argued that the
advisory body was balanced with
different views on animal control.

Mr. Evans called the proposed
pit bull ban “a matter of princi-
ple...the whole issue is how we are
concerned about human beings as
opposed to dogs.”

He challenged county animal
control ofﬁcers to point to any
other breed of dog that’s killed a
human being, and he tried to get
an ofﬁcer to admit that the pit bull
is the most deadly of canine
breeds. The unidentiﬁed animal

control expert would agree that the ,
pit bull has .“stronger jaws, and ‘
the bite goes deeper.” But, he said 5.

“he believes German Shepherds, '
‘Dobermans and other breeds “have

the same propensity” to attack.

Nevertheless, Mr. Evans said, '

“If I had to be bitten, and I had a

choice, I would not pick a pit bull.”

Commissioner Jean Williams

cited a list of local dog attacks. the

past year-and-a-half, showing that
pit bulls are far below other breeds
in the number of reported bites of

' humans. ~

said, “You are spending all that
5‘ money on just a cat?” Well, it was
my money, wasn’t it? And for 14
j years, it was Isabella’s love, given
freely. It was she who reached up
to touch my tear-wet face with her
remaining paw when I cried alone, ‘
missing George; she who tried to

LA farewell to a pet that
‘was more than just a Cat

«-v- “a.-.” . D...

i . Fourteen years ago, George and "
'I pulled into a multilevel parking
garage in downtown Atlanta and,
grabbing our respective attache
icases, rushed off in the direction of

 

our respective offices.

, We never made it on time. Near

:the garage stairs, meowing repeti-
tively and in a much more-bombas-
~tic voice than her tiny size would

. indicate, was a petite, young kitty '
cat, all caramel, jet and white, and i

with huge eyes that would ut Eliz-
abeth Taylor’s to shame. he kitty
was missing a front leg (her skin
f was still pink where it had been
I severed), had a dent on the other
front leg and a nick on the nose.
People were stepping around and
j over her, dashing to start the busi-
ness morning. ‘
‘ George and I looked at each
f other, -agonized — everyone tells
himself, “What we do not need is
, another cat” (or dog or whatever)
‘ — and then picked her up and took
her back to the car.

Exhausted, but saved, she shut .

up and hunched down on the floor-
board. At my first Opportunity away
from my desk, I hurried back with
water and food. And. so Isabella en-
tered our lives. .

She should have been Cleopatra
or Nefertiti, because her jewellike
eyes were surrounded by outlines as
black as kohl. But ,I named her in
honor of the queen of Spain, who
was a remarkable, indomitable
woman far worthier than just the
legend she is known by for selling

jewels to send Columbus on his voy-

a e. -
g Isabella the cat was wary of
George for a long time, which hurt
his feelings. We surmised that her
injuries must have been connected
with a man. She also was wary of
Clarence, our huge, clumsy gray cat
with a heart as big as he was, and
he spent weeks in a frenzy of trying
'to win her affection. Gato, our sen-
; ior statesman (sort of like a John
‘ Houseman with fur), wanted nothing
to do with her and thereafter dis-
dained all contact. "
" But she came to love persistent
T Clarence and wistful George, and
7 they in turn adored her. Isabella
f variously got nicknames from my
j' doting husband: Izzy, Pooh, Little
- Butterfly. The latter was, because
she was as graceful,‘lovely and tiny
as one. She also was quicker than a
panther.

 

_;. 13.2; ...‘t- a; -9: .

All of our cats have taught me"

great lessons that apply to human

; life. Isabella’s contribution to my
education was to regard so-called
handicapped peeple 'in a different
’ light. She never, ever let her loss of
I a leg keep her down. That is be-
'7 cause she was not handicapped in
7 her mind, and that, I think, is the

.trick to living with and possibly
overcoming any trauma that hap«
pens to the body. She taught me
that a leg that is missing, an arm
that does not work as well as the
next person’s — whatever the physi-
cal problem —— does not make a
person any less of a person and that
we all have “handicaps,” even if,
they are not apparent to others.

A couple of weeks ago, I took

f Isabella to the veterinarian just for
a checkup. She was healthy, I
thought. He called me a few days "

later with shocking news. Isabella

 

:was extremely ill with kidney fail- .

Sure. He didn’t think she would make

it. He could treat her with IVs, but
it would be costly, and, in the long

.0

run, he didn’t believe it would work. ,

The alternative was to put her to

sleep.

I’ve never had to do that to an
animal. I cried, and fretted, and fi-
nally, after talking to a friend who
had undergone the experience with
her beloved dog, I decided I should
stop thinking of myself, st0p avoid-
ing responsibility and do what was
best for Isabella. I‘ went to see her.

She was pitifully thin, losing
hair, and one lovely eye was cloud-
ed. But the IV had not bothered her,
she did not seem in pain and she
rubbed my hand affectionately. I
couldn’t put her to sleep. George
could never understand suicide, nev-
er — it was just not in his makeup
— nor did he believe in euthanasia.
George always tried, always. He

never gave up. And if he had been -

there, he wouldn’t have understood

I got Isabella out of the clinic
the other day. She had begun eating
again, her eye had cleared up some
and the vet thought her home envi-
ronment might make a difference.
Once there, although she was wob-
biy, she talked more than Joan Rise»
ers and happily ate everything in
sight. The next day, she was weak-
er. That night —— last night — she

could barely stand but was in no

apparent pain or discomfort. I held
her a long, long time, and we
“talked” to each other — of George,
of whether animals went to a heav-

. en, of how she used to race up trees

to show off. .
Isabella died during the early

morning hours, and I (who never
i gardened because I could not man-
‘ age to get a spade three centime-
; ters into hard ground) dug, with
blistered, bleeding hands, a grave
_- near the huge oak-sheltered boul-
E ders on which she liked to recline.

was not “just a cat.” She was fam-

humane treatment of animals and am closely watching the legislation on
the House side.

I have contacted the Department of Agriculture several times to
express my support for strong enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act,
and the article you sent me on the Milwaukee slaughterhouse case only
underlines the need to fight for better enforcement of existing laws
that protect animals' rights.

The bill you mention in your letter of July 9, H.R. 2A1, is still
pending in the House Committee on Agriculture, and I am awaiting its
being reported out to the full House of Representatives. I understand
that it has accumulated several cosponsors and should be considered
before the end of the year. As usual, I will keep your thoughts in
mind should it come before me in the Senate.

Thanks again for writing. Keep in touch.

LOS ANGELES, July 24 —— For the
fast several years residents near
Laurel Canyon Park, a four-acre

patch of green in an affluent. area of
“Los Angeles, have been divided over
-who should take precedence: playing
children or unleashed dogs.
The dispute has proved to be one
,that is not easily solve’l at a neighbor-
“hood meeting, and even some nation-
~“ally known politicians have become
‘involved, including former Vice
President Walter F. Mondale.
“’ The issue of child versus ~dog
~heated up a few weeks ago when the
" City Council member who represents
the area proposed a compromise that
would split the park’s hours of use.
"Dogs would be allowed to run free
{from dawn to 9 A.M. and again from
‘4230 PM. to 10:30 PM. In between,
they would be allowed only on a leash.

‘The proposal from Michael Woo,
' the Council member, seemed to inten-
‘sify the dispute between the two

’groups, who refer to themselves as
:_ “the parents” and “the dog people.”

Threats of Confrontation

Both sides have threatened to turn

, Yesterday was an eventful day

-‘ rector of the Chapultepec Park
Zoo in Mexico City.

In the morning the 200’s latest
, and most precious arrival — a
38-day-old giant panda — opened
§ its eyes for the first time. “It was
' beautiful,” Ms. Hoyo said.
. A few hours later, Ms. Hoyo
' was in Memphis for a final in-
spection of quarters prepared
for Qiu-Hua, another panda from
Chapultepec Park scheduled to
arrive in Memphis a week from

 

today. The panda will be on view

She approved of the quarters.
“They have completed every-
thing that we asked for that
would be the most comfortable

speaking through translator An-
drew Duck, a consultant for the
bilingual program of the state
Department of Education.

She said the animals are so be-
loved that “even on a slow day”
5,000 to 6,000 people come to see
them.

rently has six pandas, four of
which were born at the 200 from

Chinese government in 1975.

professional work of many
years,” Ms. Hoyo said.
“And there is love between the
original pair,” she added. , ’
Because Qiu-Hua (pronounced
Shoe Wah) is the first of the pan-
das ever to leave Mexico City, a
parade will be held for the ani-
mal on. the day of its departure,
_ Ms. Hoyo said. ‘_‘The parade will

He and Ms. Hoyo attended a

Mayor Dick Hackett; Charles

and representatives of Federal

about 17 live in zoos outside of

: UTICA, N.Y. (UPI) — The Utica
Zoo is attracting hundreds of visi-
tors to see an exhibit of caged Ho-
mo Sapien J uvenilis Americanus —
teen-agers eating, sleeping and gab-
bing on the phone just like they do
at home. '

“The reaction was incredible.
We’ve had calls from the French
broadcasting company, at least
three radio stations in Australia,
and throughout Canada,” zoo Direc-
tor Mark Rich said. "

“We know one person in the gift
shop commented they drove up
from Virginia to see it,” he said.

Rich said the zoo society expects
the attraction to increase its income
by about $7,000. Zoo attendance has
doubled to about 800 people on
weekdays and 1,600 on weekends.

“It’s a windfall for us,” he said,
“and it is not just the money. Every-
body who comes here has smiles on
--their faces.”

The exhibit is decorated to re-

semble the teens’ native habitat --
a cluttered bedroom. The youths eat
pizzas, watch television and read
magazines while an ever-curious ti-
ger watches from a nearby cage.

“We try to adhere to their natu- 7

ral diet,” Rich said. “We feed them
hamburgers and hot dogs, pizzas,
candy and sodas.”

Two or three area teen-agers oc-
cupy the cage in two-hour shifts

' from 11 am. until 5 pm. daily.

“The teen-agers take it all in
stride. For the second week, they’ve
called us to volunteer for it,” Rich
said, adding that the idea for the
exhibit started as a joke. ‘

“We were planning activities for
the summer, and we wanted to have
at least something different and

new each week,” he said. “This was .

one that came up, and we laughed

about it, and said it would be fun to ,

do and might catch the public’s

for the MDC zoos

In a letter published on July 8

, (“Neglected zoo an example of
5 state's operations”) statements

were made that were not only
mean—spirited but wrong. .

The MDC-operated zoos at
Stoneham and Franklin Park are

“ 6n the verge of a renaissance.

Most of the credit goes to MDC
Commissioner William Geary and
the Boston Zoological Society and
its president, Richard Bland.

It’s certainly not news that
these zoos are in need of manage-
rial and structural help. But ani-
mals are not suffering and lacking
proper care. Animals, in general,

_ are not "sick and debilitated” un-

less, from time-to-time, one be-
comes injured or ill. In that case,

'7 the zoos’ full-time veterinarian

and other members of the staff
take the necessary action.
What the MDC and the society

have been struggling to achieve

for almost 20 years is now very

‘ close, both politically and finan-
' cially. That is the beginning of a
‘ turnaround process for the two

zoos, which will provide much bet—

_ ter environments for animals and-

vlsitors, and a spectacular set 0f
educational facilities.
If we are to have zoos as we en-

ter the let century, they muSt be

as good as possible for animals

f and for visitors, or we shouldn’t
, have them. From everything I

have seen and heard, we are very
close to~achieving the best.

‘ ’ l-<3lWry Park Zoo ‘Will Be
Bigger —-- and Much Better

hose of you who remember, as we

do, Lowry Park’s hodgepodge col- '

lection of animals in cramped cages
might understandably scoff at the no-
tion that the zoo couldaever be consid-
ered one of the nation’s finest.

But when zoo officials at the popu-
lar Tampa park say their facility will
soon‘be listed among the country’s top
10 zoos, they do not exaggerate.

We recently toured the zoo, where
work on the first phase of what ulti-
mately will be a $20-million expansieiz
project is well under way. When the
zoo — to be renamed the Lowry Park
Zoological Garden -— is reopened to
the public early next year, visitors
will be awed and delighted by the re-
markable transformation.

The cages are gone. Animals will
live in areas replicating their native
habitat. The barriers won’t be bars
but natural-looking streams, dry
guiches er boulders. To watch work-
men craft these “boulders” out of ce-
ment is to witness the 200’s commit-
ment to realistic detail. The
chimpanzee area, for instance, has a
termite mound in which sweets will
be kept so zoologists can observe if
the chimps will use, as they do in the
wild, twigs to get at the treats inside.

This illustrates, as well, the con-
”cern with education and Conservation
of zoo superintendent Doug Porter
and his staff. The zoo, with new edu-
cational facilities, will work extensive-
ly with local schools. And it will par-
ticipate in a number of research
programs, including one headed by
famed primate researcher Jane Good-
all. Zoo scientists will be deeply in-
volved in programs to save endan-
gered species in Florida.

Among the displays to be construct-

ed in the initial work phase are the
Asian domain, primate world, a vast
aviary, and a‘petting zoo. The second
phase, likely to finished in 1989, will
include an African savannah and the

'important Florida exhibit, which will

have manatees and other endangered
native species. The zoo may even par-
ticipate in Florida’s efforts to reintro-
duce the long vanquished red wolf ‘
back into the wild.

Area residents can rightfully take
pride in the see beceu is their
donations that are making this exqui-
site facility possible. The city of Tam-
pa gave the project momentum by
awarding it an $8.1 million grant to be
matched by private donations. And
community response has been strik-
mg.

With developer Dick Beard chair-
ing the fund-raising drive, more than
$7 million in donations has already
been committee. Aeerg‘; these con-
tributing more than $500,000 dollars
are the Lykes family, General Tele-
phone Co., the Lowry family, Pepsi-
Cola Co. and the Jim Walter Corp. But
no less impressive are the thousands
of small donations from individuals, '
including school children.

We’re confident that after the Low-
ry Park Zoological Garden opens, big
and small contributors alike will feel
their money was well spent and then
some. '

We have just one small suggestion.
During our visit to the zoo, our ques-
tion of whether there would be ac-
commodations for one ’or more great
and fascinating gorillas appeared to
be indefinitely answered. We want it ‘
known that however others may feel _‘-.
on the subject, we are very much pro-

- gorilla.

United Press International

Washington

With the death of a baby
giant panda at the‘National
Zoo, a wildlife expert warns
that the survival of the rare spe-
cies is at a more critical stage
than that of the Bengal tiger,
and zoos are not the answer.

“We acknowledge a future role
of zoos. Zoos can provide coopera-
tion,” said Bruce Bunting, head of
the World Wildlife Fund’s Asia pro-
gram. “But the real need is habitat.
You’ve got to set aside wild areas.’.’

The survival of the giant panda,
which has a dwindling natural habi-
tat, has suffered repeated breeding
setbacks in captivity —— the latest
recently with the death of the sec-
ond panda cub born to Ling-Ling at
the National Zoo.

The other twin died soon after
birth. Ling-Ling, a gift from China
and the only panda to give birth in
the United States, has lost each of
her four cubs since 1983.

Zoo officials promised not to
abandon efforts to raise pandas in
captivity, but they acknowledged
that Ling-Ling, at 18, may be able to
breed only for another two years or
less.

There have been only six suc-
cessful panda births outside China,
the most recent in Mexico City.
There are about 50 pandas in captiv-
ity in China; 17 are in zoos in other
countries, including four in the
United States: Ling—Ling and her
mate, Hsing-Hsing, in Washington,
and two on loan from China to the
Bronx Zoo in New York.

Bunting warned that the cur-

rent plight of the panda is “more
critical” than that of the Bengal ti-
ger native to southern Asia, which
needed a massive effort by environ-
mentalists before it was saved from
extinction.

In the wild, the expert estimat-
ed, there could be as few as 700
pandas left, nearly all of them in the
Szechuan Province of southwestern
China.

“The Bengal tiger never got to
that low a number, and we under-
stood tiger biology very well,” he
said. “We still need much more in-
formation (about pandas), but we’re
getting it.”

Bunting said the agricultural
needs of China, the world’s most
p0pulous nation, are ravaging the
panda’s habitat, which includes
bamboo, virtually the only food the
animal will eat.

“They will eat other things,
even meat, but they’re not quick
enough to be a true carnivore,” he
said. “They have a modification in
their paw, like an extra thumb.
Their whole body has been modi—
fied to be like a bamboo factory."

The World Wildlife Fund, a pri-
vately financed organization based
in Geneva with 22 offices world-
wide, has spent mure than $4 mil-
lion this decade studying the panda,
which the group uses as its symbol,
Bunting said.

It has a research center in Sze-
chuan Province and has radio track~
ing devices on two pandas because
“you could spend weeks there with-

out seeing one,” he added, noting he 1
recently returned from the region ‘

and did not see one at all.




TRAVEL-HOLIDAY - July 1987

Zoo Tours

 

lorenz Ziegfeld once equated

elephants with good fortune.

. I recalled this as I sat under a
hot midmorning sun in a bleacher
beside a small grass airﬁeld in east-
central Thailand. I ﬁgured that if
the legendary theatrical producer
was right, I was in for a dramatic
dose of good luck. For on the ﬁeld
in front of me and other camera—
toting famngs, or foreigners, about
100 elephants were trampling the
ground in a grand-scale rodeo.

The annual Elephant Round—
Up, held on a mid-November
weekend in Surin, Thailand,
brings together the single largest
assemblage of tame elephants in
the world—close to 150 animals——
onto a space scarcely larger than a
professional football ﬁeld. To the
delight of elephant aficionadOs
from around the world, these dex-
terous domestics play soccer, run
relay races and engage in a game of
tug ofwar with the Thai Army (100
soldiers versus one adult male
“tusker”). The grand ﬁnale—a
historic battle re-enactment, com—
plete with foot soldiers, ﬁreworks
and elephants colorfully clad for
battle—is the kind of spectacle that
would have made the great
Ziegfeld proud.

This unusual event is the main
attraction of a program organized
by the Washington Park Zoo in
Portland, Oregon. It is one of a
new breed of specialty tour pack—
ages called “zoo tours” that are
gaining popularity with amateur
naturalists across the United
States. Over the past three years,
this particular trip to Thailand has

by David G. Gordon

attracted a mixed bag of zoo keep-

, ers, animal trainers, zoo docents

and volunteers, artists, photogra-
phers and a few adventure travel
lovers like myself.

Such specialty tours give the
curious a chance to share shoulder—
to-shoulder with professional zoo
staffs and ﬁeld biologists, the joy of
exotic exploration. Participants
gain an in-depth understanding of
the world’s ecosystems, observe
the lifestyles of a particular group
of animals ﬁrsthand and view rare
or endangered animals in their
natural habitats. Zoo workers say
these programs also sensitize peo-
ple to real conservation issues in
the world.

For zoos and aquariums, such
tours provide an enjoyable way to
educate the zoo-going public.
They often give zoo staffs the
chance to establish professional
contacts at foreign zoos, paving the

way for cooperative projects or.

animal trades. At the same time,
the tour’s sponsoring institutions
can gain ﬁnancial support; dona—
tions are often included as part of
the zoo-tour package.

Today, nearly every major ani-
mal park offers its own schedule of
specialty expeditions. The New
York Zoological Society, the Cin-
cinnati Zoo, the New England
Aquarium, the San Diego Zoologi-
cal Society, Chicago’s Brookﬁeld
Zoo and the Arizona Sonora Des—
ert Museum all host several excur-
sions into the wilds each year.

One organization, the Zoo and
Aquarium Travel Association

(ZATA) of Birmingham, Ala-

bama, coordinates the itineraries
of more than 70 zoos across Amer—
ica. ZATA outﬁts a year’s worth of
excursions, publishes its own sup-
port textbooks and provides its
own trained staff of biologists to
assist tour guides and escorts.
The nonprofit organization
Members Aﬁeld of Seattle, Wash-
ington, assists aquariums, botani-
cal gardens and zoos in organizing
expeditions to Central and South
America, Australia and, this year,
to the previously inaccessible wild-
life preserves of China.
Zoo—sponsored tours often
structure their itineraries around a
particular animal species or _a
unique habitat. ZATA’s Thailand
program, for example, concen-
trates on the Asian elephant. The
program’s fast-paced schedule
consists of visits to Thai zoos, ele—
phant shows and even a govern-
ment-run elephant training center,
where 2,0004pound calves are
taught the skills needed for teak
logging. Thailand’s domestic ele-
phants are capable of responding
to as many as 30 separate com-
mands—dragging felled trees,
stacking logs, freeing up log
jams—goaded only by the voice of
a mahout or by light tactile signals.
Participants learn about the
functions the elephant serves in
contemporary Southeast Asian
society, such as assuring the health
of an unborn child by striding care-
fully over the supine mother-to-be.
Still observed is the ancient prac-
tice of awarding royal status to so-
called “white elephants”——ani-
mals with somewhat fairer

 




hides, blue or golden eyes and white
tail hairs. An elephant possessing
these rare traits automatically
becomes the property of the king,
who today cares for a private herd
of 11 such auspicious beasts on the
grounds of his Bangkok palace.

Another tour by ZATA focuses
on endangered Indian wildlife.
This 22-day expedition features
stops at three separate Bengal tiger
preserves and a day at the interna-
' tionally known Keoladez Bird
Park. With the Himalayas as a
backdrop, groups ride elephants
across the green savannas of the
Kaziranga Preserve in Assam, a
region known for its population of
rare, one—horned Indian rhinoc-
eros. On one trip in the past, the
group tallied over 30 of these highly
endangered rhinos—a count that
included several cows with calves.

Other zoo tours visit the Galapa—
gos Islands, the volcanic staging
ground for many of Darwin’s theo-
ries on evolution; explore island
ecology in Hawaii; journey to the
tropical jungle of the Amazon
River Basin and the high-altitude
sanctuaries of Peru; and go on
safari to Kenya’s Serengeti Wildlife
Refuge.

Getting Set for Satori

To prepare for a zoo—sponsored
outing, one may‘want to do a little
home study—not only about the
geographical region to be visited,
but about the wildlife phenomena
to be observed. A number of good
ﬁeld guides on the ﬂora and fauna
of speciﬁc regions are available.
Just as valuable is a general text
detailing animal interactions or
illustrating general principles of
ecology. For example, prior to my
Thai adventure, I immersed myself
in Southeast Asia travel guides,
studied two overviews on the natu-
ral history of elephants and brought
along Elephant Bill, the classic first-
hand narrative of Lieutenant Colo-
nel J. H. Williams, a “frightfully
English” teak logger stationed in
Burma during the thirties.

One should bring a camera and
read an introductory guide to na-
ture photography beforehand. If
bringing along new photo equip-
ment, it is advisable to spend a day
or two practicing shots at a zoo or
wildlife park. One should pack
enough film in a variety of speeds in
order to be able to photograph in
conditions that range from the glar—
ingly lighted African veldt to the
tree—shrouded recesses of the pri-

' meval forest.

While zoo-sponsored expedi-
tions are no more strenuous than
any other type of travel, partici—
pants may find themselves waking
at dawn to glimpse that seldom—
sighted weaver finch or staying up
past midnight to observe the noc—
turnal crowding at a nearby water
hole. One should get plenty of rest
before the trip so as not to miss a
single moment of these animal-
intensive itineraries.

TAMPA TRIBUNE/TIMES - July 26,1987

Panther more than a

By TOM McEWEN
Tribune Sports Editor

Recently at a Florida Council of
100 meeting in Naples, one featur-
ing sports‘commissioners Pete Roz-
elle, David Stern , Dean Beman and
American League President Bobby
Brown, a nameless two-year-old
stole the show and most impressed

some of the state’s movers and

shakers.

The unannounced star was a
magnificient, 125-pound Florida
panther who was walked on a leash
through the crowd by his trainer
Bert Wahl, then allowed to lie at the

feet of program emcee Hugh F. Cul- ,

verhouse, owner of the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers. The cat was completely
relaxed, yawning a couple of times
and all but purring as members of
his audience walked up to pet him.
Wahl then made a little speech
about the Florida panther, how they
are a specie of the cougar, how this
» ; cat was trained by him from nine

I Weeks Of 386, how there are only,
. about 31 wild panthers in the Floris "

{da wilds now but that all efforts are

being made to save those and in-
crease the numbers with the Flori-

da Game and Fresh Water Fish .

Commission in the forefront. And
he told how he, Bert Wahl, of Tam—
pa, had involved himself in a per-
sonal Save The Panther campaign
'9 and why.

It is a story Wahl in 1986 told to
22,000 students as well as countless
adults, indeed, to anybody who will

listen, on behalf of the panther and '

on behalf of his Wildlife Rescue
Mission in Tampa. The namless
panther before him is the attention-
getter.

“1 get their attention,lthen I try
to educate,” said Wahl, whose Mis-
sion is made up of volunteers, just
like he is, and funded by donations.
Wildlife Rescue provides care for

, sick, injured or helpless wild ani-
mals. That includes racoons under a
house, snakes in a garden, skunks in
your hard, or baby birds or squir-
rels fallen from trees.

“All healthy animals are direct-
ly relocated. Those needing other
care receive our other services,”

Wahl said. He haduworkedm for the ‘

Hillsborough Humane Society and
received many calls about injured
wild animals. That gave him the
idea for Wildlife Rescue. He creat- A

ed it in 1981, still working at assort- 3
ed jobs for his own income. He has ;

never drawn a salary.

You need only” see Wahl work

3 with his panther to realize his devo-
‘ tion to what he preaches. Not once,
i in all of its public appearances, has

' the cat been ill-tempered, or threat-

ened. He has no name because ‘

“when he was very young and I was

training him, I decided to call him.

by the same chirps and high whistle
with which panthers communicate.
: Later when I could have given him
a name, well, I just forgot. It wasn’t

' important, ” said Wahl.
“It all began when I read in 1984

’ of the stories of how a wild Florida

panther named Big Guy was hit by

‘ a car on Alligator Alley,” the cross-

Florida highway from Naples to the

' East Coast. “I read how he was
saved — and by the way is now be—
ing encouraged to breed in captivity
é —— and I began to research the pan-
;- thers. I had already started Wildlife

'___4_.

Rescue, in 1981. I felt if 1 could find

and train a panther I could get at-

”tention, encourage support for the

programs to save this precious na-
tive animal, and provide visibility
for my Wildlife Rescue.”

It has worked.

Wahl waited until a litter of pan-
thers were bred by the Piper Broth-
ers at their Everglades Wonder Gar-
dens in Bonita Springs -— the Pipers
were pioneers in breeding panthers
in captivity, indeed, causing their
strain to be known as the Piper
strain. Bill and Lester Piper they

, were. Only Lester lives now.

. “I got this fellow (the panther)

’when he was nine weeks, after

watching him from four days of
age. I also took his sister with me to
Wildlife Rescue so they would have
a more natural childhood. We kept
them in a room next to our office

then moVed him into our office and
weaned him away. When our guy

was 16 weeks old, we began to trav-
el with him and we sent his sister
back. to her home —- oh, but she’s
back with us again now and we are

working with her, too. Well, our ,

panther became a perfect gentle-.
' man and he is to this day.”

Wahl and his pet make their an

pearances, he makes his talk, and
j they encourage listeners to write

letters in support of the Florida
agencies involved in protecting and
re-populating wildlife. That way, he
says, legislators and high officials
are more apt to understand why the
monies are needed and how they
are to be spent.

“The teachers love us, as do the

‘ children We are able to talk on a
subject the children love and on

which there is so little information.
“We tell them that the panther

. is really a sub-specie of the cougar.

A cougar is a felis concolor. There

, are 30 sub-species in South and

North American. The panther na-
tive to Florida is the coryi. There
are all kinds of arguments about
whether this panther is the genu-
nine Florida panther or not, be-
cause of his breeding, but is that
important?

“The children listen then are al-
lowed to pet him as he sits on a
table in exchange for a promise to
write a letter. They usually do.”

His educational program, he

ness and that is his purpose.

“Most if not all of our panthers
in the wild are in the Everglades
area, though one was spotted near
Kissimmee. The game commission

 

has been successful in restricting

,“4... ., _._.,...___

’hunting in those areas so as not to

diminish potential food for the pan-
thers. That’s a good step, and biolo-

" gists are constantly monitoring the

animals and involved in breeding
programs.” .

Meanwhile, back at the Tampa
Wildlife Rescue location (127 W. Hi-
awatha Street, phone 238- 0341)
Wahl and his volunteer friends are
tending daily to wounded otters,
owls, hawks, andputting together a
wildlife show that will be shown on
Jones Intercable.

They have a few animals on dis- °

play, and they have the ward of

’ cages where they are tending to the

wounds and injuries. And they are
selling posters for $20 for funds and
they are preparing, Charlton Ford
said, for an Aug. 2 Save The Florida
Panther Education Program at

Panther poster proceeds to be use
for education, wildlife restoration

A Tribune Staff Report

The folks at Wildlife Rescue have put together a striking color
poster of the Florida panther, with a portrait of one of the 30 or so
remaining felines nearly life size. The shot was made by top Tampa
photographer Burton McNeely, and the quality of the reproduction
should make this a hot item for office decor.

Similar prints have sold at sporting auctions for as much as $200,

4 making this a real bargain for area outdoorsmen and
conservationists.

Funds from the sale of the 22-by-34 inch print will go toward
"educating the public on the panther’s plight, and toward the wildlife
restoration efforts of the non-profit group. ' '

Und

By MIKE HENRY
Tribune Sports Writer"

ST. PETERSBURG — Pat Rose has been described by
some opponents as a zealot. And he would be the first to
admit protection of the manatee is close to an obsession.

But he vigorously denies claims he has purposely un-

derestimated the population of the endangered West Indi-'

an manatee that is indigenous to these waters.

Rose, 36, works in St. Petersburg for the Department

of Natural Resources and is its marine mammal coordi~
nator within the department’s Bureau of Marine Re-
search. Part of his job is keeping close tabs on the state’s
manatee population. '

“We have no good method yet to determine popula-
tion growth trends of the manatees,” said Rose. “But if

_ we find an increase, I’ll be overjoyed to report it.”

In fact, Rose revised the state’s manatee population
estimate in 1985 from around 1,000 to 1,200, the figure he
currently cites. And with more than 1,100 manatees fatal-
ities since 1974 (see charts), Rose thinks tighter restric-
tions are needed for marine developers.

Almost 25 percent of the known manatee mortalities

have resulted from boat or barge collisions, and including .

those deaths attributed to gate/dam accidents and other
human causes, more than 30 percent of the deaths result-
ed from man’s intervention.

Rose also says that about half of the manatees his

I agency tracks bear scars from boat propellers.

Although he says his research staff is swamped, Rose
hopes to establish county-by-county manatee protection
plans beginning with Lee and Brevard counties, the two
with the most mortalities since records began being kept.

He also is active in establishing slow boating zones,
and his effon to have an emergency zone declared at
Port of the Islands Resort & Marina (20 miles south of
Naples) after two recent manatee boating-related deaths
has angered Ray.

,“If the governor and cabinet declare an emergency
rule it will create a great hardship for us,” said Ray. “It’s
a distance of four miles from our marina to the first bay,
and a slowdown will make it very difficult to boat at our
resort.

“My position is that there are alternative ways to pro- ‘

tect the manatees. ”

But Rose is just as concerned with the sea grasses and
estuaries that surround the manatees as he is with the
species’ ultimate survival. Hence his adamancy about the
beneficial nature of the general permit to slow dock

building.

“If in 20 years we’ve dealt with fatalities but not habi-
tat protection, where are we? We have to face these
issues for people protection,” he said.

Getting back to the general permit proposal: “It actu-

ally is a permissive thing,” said Rose. “it gives a builder a

Pat Rose says protecting the grassy areas where
manatees thrive is just as important as protect-
ing them from boats.

quick and easy way through the system if their project is
reasonable and won’t have an adverse impact on the
environment.

“If someone doesn’t meet those conditions, they would
have to go through the full permitting process. That

, doesn’t mean they necessarily wouldn’t get a permit.

“What’s happening is a condominium developer is
coming in with 300 feet of shoreline and 80 units, and he
wants 80 boat slips. Then the same thing With the next
condo. The habitat probably can’t sustain this and it’s not
only going to impact manatees, you’re going to lose your
shrimp, gamefish and nursery grounds.”

While Rose professes to be a proponent of zoning —-
“there are some areas where projects shouldn’t be built,”
he maintains — he hopes the desires of the environmen-
talists can be balanced with those of the state’s multibil-
lion-dollar boat industry.

“Our waterways are limited, and we have to preserve
what’s there if we want to benefit. 1 want the quality of
the experience worth doing.”

Staff Writer . ‘
BOCA RATON— The city soon may be
catering to thousands of additional resi-
dents —— the four-legged kind.

. Philanthropist Rolland Ritter says he 3
wants‘the city to take over the Lullis M.~

Ritter Animal Shelter he and his wife es-
tablished 15 years ago because they are
getting old

“I turned 80 last month and my wife 15 a
year younger,” Ritter said Monday.

He wants the city to take over the opera-
tion of the shelter from the Boca Raton Hu-
mane Society. Ritter is chairman of the
' Humane Society, which gets $117,000 from
the city each year as well as donations
raised by the Humane Society Foundation.

Ritter said caring for the shelter has '

been a labor of love for the Ritters and for
Ritter’sfriend of 53 years, Harry Stuhl-
"muller, 77, vice chairman of the shelter.

Ritter said the city has the resources

and the interest to ensure that quality care '

continues at the shelter on Boca Rio Road
south of Glades Road.

“The facility is spotless. It is beautifully
maintained,” said City Engineer Ron Lac—

ceo, who played a videotape of the sheiter’s - ‘

facilities for the City Council during Mon-
, day’s workshop session.

It is a $1. 4 million package, Ritter said.
The city can have all of the shelter’ 5 assets
‘plus a contribution of $550, 000 over four
‘ years toward operations, he said.

7/28/87

, “That’s it. Take it or leave it,” Ritter
said. '

Council members indicated they Would
probably take it. But some concerns first
must be addressed, they said. _

City Manager Jim Rutherford promised
to analyze the shelter’s operation and pro-
ject the financial picture in his 1987- 88
budget. The shelter’ 5 current budget is

' $345, 000, he said.

. Some council members, including Bill

«Smith, expressed concern that it could be-

come a problem for the city if the shelter
starts to lose money consistently.

. “Most people do not realize that the soci-
ety has done so much work,” council mem-
ber‘Al Travasos said. “You’re doing such a
good job that we don’trsee any problems,”
hetold Ritter. _

Thomas Sliney, the society’s president,
and Rutherford conceded that some of the
shelter’s services would have to be cut
back. Currently, the shelter Serves 3 large
area of western south county as well as
northern Broward County. If it becomes a
city shelter it would serve only the city,
council members agreed; .

The $117,000 a year from the city covers
the cost of picking up stray animals, pro-
viding medical care, food and shelter, try-
ing to place the strays in good homes and,
if necessary, destroying them.

The shelter property is surrounded by a

15-acre bird sanctuary. The society has

leased the 15 acres from the county for 99
years at $1 a year.

'MEMPHIS COD/MERCIAL APPEAL - July 30, 1987

,Maimed birds of prey aid

hunt for understanding

 

By Vernal Noel Jones

 

Scripps Howard News Service

AURORA, Colo. -—- Not far from '

here live 17 birds of prey, includ-
ing a bald eagle, golden eagle,
numerous falcons and owls,
even Harris hawks and red-
tailed hawks.

Such birds are born to hunt.
Yet these birds never capture
their own food. Many, in fact,
have never learned how.

Instead, the birds live in a
2,000-acre, state-designated na-
ture area called Plains Conser-
vation Center, serving as educa
tional tools in a program de-

signed to teach the public the»

important role predators play in
maintaining the natural envi-
ronment.

The birds, also known as rap-
tors, were collected by Peter Re-
shetniak to be emissaries for the
Raptor Education Foundation,
which has its headquarters at
the nature, site. The foundation

niak, and the only one near a

. the foundation .
‘ president, has a dream to devel- ~

large pOpulation center. “That

_ puts us in a strong position to de-

velop a lot of public awareness,”
he says.

Despite his efforts over the
last six years and contact with
thousands of people, Reshetniak
says the public still is vastly
unaware of the problems faced
by raptors.

“The raptors’ biggest .prob-
lems are habitat loss and human
encroachment, followed by
shootings and toxins in the envi-
ronment,” he says. ,

When the raptor population is
reduced, the public loses more

than the birds, says Sharon,

Hines, the foundation’s chief
lecturer.

“Predators maintain the natu-
ral environment,” she says.
“They eat mice and rats and rab-
bits -- animals that multiply ra-
pidly -— or those that are sick or
injured or. crippled or diseased.

“In the areas where no pred-
ators are left, the prairie species
have become a serious problem.
Without them, things are totally

3 out of balance.” -

Ms.‘Hines says predators are a
barometer, to the health of the

pens when people are irrespon-

sible. All the raptors in the foun-, L
dation’s care have been victims .

of man or man-made toxins.
They no longer can fend for
themselves in the wild.

The stately bald eagle was a

gunshot victim -- blinded in one '

eye from the bullet.

“Today he’s one of the few
bald eagles nationally that tra—
vels and can deal with crowds of
2,000 to 3,000 a day,” says Reshet-
niak. -

Many other birds in their care
are what might be described as
psychologically crippled; called
imprints, they became depen-
dent on peopleat a young age
and are unable to identify with
their own species.

“Many times, if people find a
little owl in a field, they assume
it needs their help so they take it

home and make a pet of it,” says .

Ms. Hines.

“In so doing, the animal identi- "

fies with peOple. He sees them as
a food source-and assump, them
to be Mom and Dad.” : '

Besides l losing their ' fear -of. .
people, “which is a dangerous

characteristic of anything in the
wild,” says Ms. Hines, the birds
never learn to hunt. “They don’t

know what to chase or how to

chase it,” she says. ~

a great horned owl, a barred owl

and a barn owl that are physical-

ly perfect, but have been im-

i. Ticking Time Bomb

Animal- Control: ‘

This is in regard to the dog that was
accidentally baked alive by Hillsborough
County Animal Control. I find it very
hard to believe this could have. hap-
pened, especially after the animal cruel-
ty coverups that were discovered last
winter. If Animal Control handled 28,000
animals a year, I ask where were the

. secondary safety checks?

It is a shame the three upper man-
agement personnel of Animal Control did
not assume even an ounce of blame for
last winter’s charges and, again, they did
not assume any responsibility for the
baking of the dog. It is terrible that these
three publicly-paid officials play a self-
serving game of “see no evil, hear no
evil, speak no evil.”

Hillsborough County Animal Control
is a time bomb just ticking away and
waiting to explode in the county commis-

sioners’ faces. I believe that the policies

and procedures implemented by the top
three people tend to promote, whether
deliberate or not, animal cruelty and low
morale. If the county commissioners do
not look into Animal Control and per-
form a no-holds-barred clean sweep, it
will blow up.

Assistant Director Lynn Goldie should
resign, Director Dan Gorman should re-
tire, and the commissioners should slap
Gil Rodriguez’s hands and get his fingers
out of the agency. .

The new director should be just that,
director of Animal Control and have no
other responsibilities. The new director
should be responsible to, and. report di-

- rectly to, the county administrator. Let’s

Often endangered wildlife into the

l

t"‘indifference of the competent authori-

iparts, say Mexico has become a clear-

linghouse for trafficking in rare and en—-'

dangered species from as far away as
Southeast Asia.

“Mexico is just an open door,” Je-
rome S. Smith, deputy chief of the Divi-
Ston of Law Enforcement at the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service, said
in a telephone interview from Washing~
. ton. ”With a border that is extremely
f long, basically unprotected and easy to
. cross, it’s like a funnel pouring wildlife
, skins and other animal products into
. the United States.” '

Mr. Smith said the value of the traf-

 

.<...-....—__-

fic in rare and endangered wildlife be-
ftween the United States and foreign
countries was $300 million to $400 mil-
lion a year. He said Mexico was “the
major source of the smuggled wildlife”
' entering the United States and was ac-
tive in illegal shipments of protected

species to Western Europe and the

Middle East.

“Right now, we knowithere are two .

to three hundred palm cockatoos being

‘1

held somewhere along the border, ;
.probably in Tijuana, just waiting for a ‘

chance to come over,” Mr. Smith said.

"Because these birds are so rare'and
hardly ever breed in captivity, you can .1

get $8,000 to $10,000 a bird, and much
more for a bonded pair.” '

Ail were
r‘éiarged with involvement in smug,
gzirtg more than 250 parrots of pro-
tected species. The birds were sold to

> A rnericans at up to $2,500 each.

In announcing the arrests, the Fish
and Wildlife Service said “variot s iiie-
gal Mexican wnoiesale suppliers,
wholesale dealers and moiwdualsf had
transported the smuggled birds. Some
of the Mexican sources “implied they
could supply 200 to 300 illegal parrots
per week,” one wildlife official added.

Fish and Wildlife officials say about
50,000 rare parrots enter the United
States illegally from Mexicoeach year,
often bringing disease with them. Mr.
Smith said there were “dozens of ani-
mal dealers” in Mexico engaged in the
smuggling of live snakes, tarantulas,
desert sheep, pickled turtle eggs, liz-
ardskin boots and pelts of spotted cats
such as jaguars and ocelots.

Rings of Professional Smugglers

Efforts to halt the trade, which is
dominated by' rings of professional

smugglers, have been complicated by,

Mexico’s unwillingness to sign the Con-l

dangered Species of Wild Flora and?
Fauna. The United States and nearly

100 other nations, including every other
. major country in the Western Herni-l
' sphere, have accepted the convention,

which forbids commerce in some spe-

 

‘ “does make things difficult, especially

with such a large body of people and
products going back and forth across
the border.”

Mexico’s Assistant Secretary for
Ecology, Sergio.Reyes Lujan, said in

. an interview that Mexico was studying
, whether “it is convenient” to ratify the

convention. BUt he said the agreement

, was “not necessarily the best mech-;

anism” to prOtect endangered species '
and could encroach on Mexico’s sover-
eignty. , ‘ ,

“The importance of the economic ac-
tivities involving some species varies
from country to country, as does the
abundance of the animals,” he said.
“Just because a speciesvis endangered
in one country does not mean it is en-
dangered in another."

Other Governments Complain

Mexico’s refusal to take part in the
international convention has made it
harder to prosecute wildlife smug—
glers, American officials say. Under
AmeriCan law, any shipment from a
participating nation that arrives in the
United States without the appropriate '
documents automatically I'lOlb'tzs the
treaty and IS a Federal crime.

But Mexico’s nonparticipation in the
agreement means American prosecu-

‘Apocryphal Documents’ I

Mexico has laws intended to protect
endangered species, most notably a set,
of regulations adopted in 1982 that al-.
lows the impqtation of animals only
for “noncommercial” purposes. But in.
their manifesto, the 11 conservation
and ecology groups in the coalition
charged that “the spirit of the law is
mocked” by the issuance of “apocry—
phal documents" and inadequate su-
pervision of reported centers of illegal
commerce here, such as private zoos
and the Mercado Sonora, a large open-
air market in downtown Mexico City.

Worse Than
Pit" Bulls

This is in regard to the July 17 edito-
rial, “WOrse Than Sharks,” regarding pit
bulls. The editorial said that pit bulls
have caused five times more deaths than
sharks since 1983.

I have done some tough research
work myself and have determined that
pit bulls have killed thousands less than
handguns and automobiles.

What do sharks, pit bulls, handguns,
and automobiles have in common? Not
much, although all can kill. Only the lat-
ter three caused injuries due to the reck-
less, careless, Or intentional misuse by
their owners.

The popular belief among the igno-
rant or misinformed public is that the pit
bull is naturally aggressive toward peo-
ple. Although a large percentage of them

Unfortunately, the pit bull appeals to
the sick idiots out there who want a ma-
cho-looking dog and train it to be aggres-
srve.

The media helps advertise the dog to
these people by printing every pit bull
attack across the nation. - ,

It seems that they are the only dogs
that bite. This is not true. In fact, the vast

majority of dog bites are by breeds other -

than pit bulls.

As for the highly publicized pit bull
attacks, most of these are by mixed-bred
pit bulls (mongrels), not purebred dogs.
A pit bull mix can hardly be expected to
have the outstanding qualities and tem-
perament of the real thing. »

Many times, any mixed-breed dog
weighing from 30 pounds and up, with
short hair, and a large head is labeled a
pit bull when it bites a person.

This is unfair to all the responsible
owners and breeders who try so hard to
undo the damage done to the reputation
of their fine animals. Still, each dog
should be judged individually.

Will banning any breed of dog stop
irresponsible dog owners who misuse the
privilege of owning a dog?

Even requiring liability insurance on
a certain breed is totally ridiculous.
Many states, including Florida, don’t
even require liability insurance on auto-
mobiles until after you’ve had an acci-
dent

I’m positive that the odds of being
killed in an auto accident are much

{greater than being killed by a pit bull or
any other dog. '

- Obviously, breed-specific legislation is

Will act aggressive toward other animals, “Qt the answer to our dog«bite problems.

 

" American agents investigating illegal
shipments often come across docu-
ments issued by Mexican state govern-f
ments. Some seem to be forgeries, he;
said, but others appear to be genuine.

“We don’t accept any state permits,;
and that’s a blanket rule,” he said. “A
lot of the time, we can’t really be sure
who we’re deaing with, so unless it;
comes out of the flora and fauna office
in Mexico City, it’s fraudulent as far as
we’re concerned.”

A Lower Priority

Mr. Reyes Lujan, the Mexican ecol~
ogy official, acknowledged that Gov-
ernment agencies not authorized to
issue permits had done so and that the
United States had complained about
the practice. In such instances, he said,
“we inform our local delegate, so that
he can make known to the local au-
thorities that this is not within their
area of responsiblity.”

Customs and border patrol officers I
from both countries who work along .
the 1,952 miles of'border are stretched i:

thin. And with drug trafficking and ille-
gal immigration to contend with, ani-
mal smuggling gets a lower priority.
This situation appears to be attract—
.ing a growing number of fortune hunts
ers. Mexican and American authorities
say a well-connected wildlife smuggler
is unlikelyto end up in jail and can earn
up to $100,000 for a few months’ work.

 

 

they pose no threat to humans. '

Throughout the breed’s history as a
fighting dog, man-biters were culled out.
Dogs used for fighting had to be handled
by many different peOple and both han-
dlers were in the pit with them during a
match. A ,dog that bit someone was de-
stroyed.

Retrievers have wonderful disposi-
tions with people but instinctively go af-
ter birds. A hunter would not put up with
a dog that tried to bite him while trying
to take the game away from it.

A‘popular use for pit bulls today is as
a catch dog in hunting wild boar. A hunt-
er needs a dog that is game enough to
catch a hog, but will not turn on him.
People-aggressive dogs are not tolerated.
The results of this selective breeding is
evident in the excellent temperaments of

many other breeds used for similar pur— ‘

poses.

Please don’t suggest that any dog that
is aggressive toward another animal,
whether it ‘be a bird, raccoon, boar, or
another dog, has to be a killer of every-
thing in its sight. .

I am not saying that pit bulls have not
attacked or killed humans. Almost all
breeds have been involved in attacks on
people. Any large dog is capable of kill-
ing someone. ‘

l Weumust make all owners responsible for
‘thell' dog’s actions since they are the

cause of the problems, just as the drivers
on the roads are responsible for what

they do with their cars whether they’re

driving a Yugo or a ’69 Cadillac.
All responsible dog owners should be
concerned with these attempts to pass

any anti-dog laws, instead of the only re-
kal solution, passing laws against irrespon-
sible dog ownership.

Dear Connie:

Thank you for your letters keeping me informed of your views on
animal rights issues, and of instances of animal abuse.

As I have discussed with you before, I share your concern for the
protection of animals from unnecessary abuse. The various bills you
referred to in your letters are currently being reviewed by the House
Interior Committee and I will be reviewing their reports should these
bills come before the House floor for a vote. You can be assured that
I will take into consideration your concerns on each of these bills
and other legislation affecting the rights of animals.

In regards to your concern about sea turtles being killed in
shrimp nets, you will glad to know that regulations were recently
issued by the Secretary of Commerce requiring shrimp trawlers to use
Turtle Excluding Devices (TEDs). These regulations will be phased in
over the next two years and will greatly improve the survival rate of
turtles caught in shrimp nets.

Thank you again for taking the time to write me about these
issues. Please contact me again about other issues important to you.

With best regards, I am

Driven from the hills by the long dry spell and the
lure of succu1ent food, deer are moving into Bay Area
suburbs in large numbers and feeding on gardens.

“They are really looking for groceries,” said Chuck

 

Graves, a wildlife manager for the state Department of
Fish and Game. ‘ . ‘ '
' When the nutrition level that deer-need from new
growth in the wild drops, the animals come down from

the hills to share their human neighbors’ produce.

’Dumbbeasts? Not these animals

‘Stupid pet trick’ fund‘raiser bow‘wows audience for a good cause

‘~ By Ken Perkins

Staff Writer of The News

When Jim Elich gets lonely in his Arl-
ington home, he talks to his dog.

And his dog talks back.

“There are times when I start putting on
my shoes, and he knows that I’m leaving
the house,” Elich said of his 1-year-old
husky. " ‘

“He’ll jump all over me and say, ‘I want
to go with you.’ ”

' In words?
“It’s words,” Elich maintains. “I can un-

derstand him better than some people.”

No one would have believed Elich and
his wonder dog before Sunday. That’s when
he unveiled Richard, a dog whose low-tone,
slurred bark comes as close as an animal
can get to word pronunciation.

Richard was the star Sunday at the
SPCA’s Second Annual Texas Dog Day After-
noon’s “stupid pet tricks” contest. At the
downtown Hilton Ballroom, Richard, with a
little incentive from dog biscuits, mumbled
“I love you, David,” and “I looooove you.”

About 600 people applauded wildly.

“That’s pretty incredible,” said Robin
Clements of Dallas. “If I wasn’t looking
right at it, I wouldn’t have believed it.”

The contest was the highlight of the So-
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals fund-raising event, which was also a
good way to disseminate information to the
public. - ' ‘

“Our purpose is to educate by promoting
greater understanding of pet responsibil-
ity, and the best way to do that is in an en-
tertaining way," said Sandra Dickson, an

‘ Richard was an easy choice for
first-prize honors in the contest.
But Elich won’t stop there. His ulti-
mate goal is an appearance on Da-
vid Letterman’s Late Night talk
show, where “stupid pet tricks” be-
gan. .

. “I’ve sent him (Letterman) two
tapes, but the first one wasn’t very
good quality. You could barely hear
it, " said Elich.

“But I sent a second one about a
month ago. I’m just waiting to hear
back. Maybe some publicity will get
us on the show.”

tricks had everything the Late

The only disappointment of the
day was the no-show of Wide Track,
the celebrity Great Dane who repre-
sents a local car dealer on televi-
sion and radio commercials. Ms.
Dickson said Wide Track became ill
and couldn’t make it ‘

' Perhaps it was a blessing in dis-
guise for Richard, who took over
center stage.

“We started when he was about 3
months,” said Elich, who picked
Richard out of a litter of 11.

“Instead of training him to bark
when he wanted Milk Bones, I
would constantly speak in English.
Then one day he mumbled it, and,

well. .

Richard was one of about 13 acts ,

that also included dogs that burst
balloons and chased flashes of

withe . Mexican tune and a mixed-
breed performed a fairly good ren-
dition of Tom Cruise’s role in Risky
Business, with shades and all.

Most of the pets, however, suf-
fered from stage fright by rolling
over and playing dead even though
they weren’t instructed to.

Lori Borowiski of Mesquite said
her parrot dances all the time at
home, but was stricken with stage
fright.

“Too many people,” Ms.
Borowiski said. “This is her first
time out in front of people like this.
So she got a little nervous.”

Pit Bullterriers

As a responsible owner of a well-
trained, loyal and loving bullterrier,l
must protest the outrageous discrimi—
nation directed against this breed in-
stead of against the owners. When I
first read about the Mo: gan Hill trage-
dy n immediate response was that

thep arents should be charged with ne—.

glect a; ad child endangerment and that
the press was unjustly “hanging” the
pet and its owner. Now that I know
more about the owner, my opinion has
changed. The parents should still be
charged, but the owner should be
hanged. Althoughl contend my pet
would'never‘bite a human, I know she
will fight another aggressive dog. I
know this and accept the responsibil-
ity. Do not destroy a breed—regulate
the ownership and the inbreeding.

Debi Bisbee

Pacific Grove, Calif.

Earlier this year my 8-year-old son was
attacked, unprovoked, by a pit bull.
The dog had to be beaten off my son
with a board. It took 13 stitches in his
face and a week of fever and pain-
ful swelling for him to recover. The
scars that remain on his face are a
constant reminder that there Is no
place in our society for pit bullterriers.
Come to think of it, there’s not much
room for the asinine owners who think

pit bulls are not dangerous.

Diane Spooner
Loxahatchee, Fla.

j Your article about the breeding of pit
' bullterriers should prove to be a power-

ful catalyst for political action in com-
munities across the United States
where this barbarism is rampant. How
ironic that in one of the most techno-
logically advanced and culturally so-
phisticated countries of the world such
debauched treatment of animals as de-
scribed in theartlcle—in the name of
“sport”—and the concomitant disre-
gard for human welfare are tolerated.

lam a pit bull owner and I am furious. I
am not, as your article so ineptly por—
trays pit bull enthusiasts to be, a “back-

. alley type” or a “drug dealer or other

lowlife.” To state that pit bulls are “less
popular among ordinary dog lovers” is

. completely absurd Now, thanks to an ‘

_...

unjust portrayal of the breed as hair-

trigger killers, pit bull owners and their
dogs are being eschewed by an ever—
growing number of communities. That
kind of biased journalism does nothing
but stir public hysteria. I own a pit bull
because she’s a loving companion and
my best friend. Isn’t that what “ordinary

Lions were misused
in deaic’r 3 ‘promotion’

. AT...ANTA -— A mobile cage was
‘ parked recently in front of a car deal-
ership cg Alpharetta Highway. Inside
were 12 crowded lions with little space
to move. Patrons of the dealership
passed by to gawk at these animals as
they suffered in the stifling heat. On
three occasions when we visited the
dealership, the animals had no Water.

The lions’ owner said he carts the
animals — whose lifespan will be 20 to-
25 years — from town to town and
makes his living by running these “pro-

‘ motions” for automobile dealers.

Representatives from Fulton County

' Animal Control and the Atlanta Hu-
mane Society investigated the situation
and said there were no legal guidelines
that permitted them to intervene on be-
half of the animals.

We are appalled that Fulton County
does not have strict anti- -cruelty laws to
protect helpless animals from peOple
who exploit them for profit. The “pro-

. motion” may have been legal, but do
'. Fulton County residents "consider this
i type of activity ethical?

We hope our local businesses will

i ask this question when they consider us-
E ing animals to further their marketing
’ goals. And we encourage our fellow At-
i lantans to speak out against and st0p ,
patronizing businesses that endorse or
participate in cruelty to animals

The suffering of animals is not

Landlords, tenants
i often fight over the
right to have pets
live in
condominiums.

 

By MICHELLE RUESS
Staff Writer

When Richard Horland looks at his
rents’ poodle, he sees an 8-pound

fluffball full of the adoration and loyal- '

ty only a pet can muster.
But members of thePine Island
Ridge Condominium Association board
. see something more: a violation of their
'- rules. - " '-
The conflict between the Horiands
~ and their condo association recently
~moved beyond condo board meetings
and into Broward Circuit Court, where
the association filed a lawsuit asking
the Horlands to get rid of Playboy the
poodle or leave. .

Such disagreements are common in
Broward County, which has at least
500,000 condominium units, lawyers
and Realtors say. Most condos prohibit
animals, they say, forcing many pro-
spective owners to choose between pets
and places to live. ‘

“It’s very difficult with pets down
here,” said Douglas Corwin, manager
for Rent-Aid Inc. in Fort Lauderdale.

’ “As far as most condos go, probably 90
percent do not allow {new} pets.”
' And rental properties that permit
pets often require additional deposits or
extra monthly charges to compensate,
Corwin said.

The restrictions are aimed at keeping
peace under crowded conditions, said
Gary Poliakoff, a Fort Lauderdale law-

yer who specializes in condominium -

law.

“What it really comes down to is re-
specting the rights of others,” Poliakoff
said. “You give up some rights of a sin-
gle-family, detached home. There are
trade-offs.” ‘

Despite restrictions, however, many
pet owners skirt the rules, said lawyers
who represent condo associations.

“Rules are rules,” said Jeffrey Streit-
feld, who handled a 1984 pet dispute for

' the Palm-Aire Country Club Condomin-

§ said.

Condo owners
challenging rules
prohibiting pets

“She managed to bamboozle the
condo,” Corwin said. ‘
But not all bamboozles succeed.

' Neighbors hear pet noises or step in

unpleasant evidence. Then the jig is
up —— and the dispute begins.

Most disputes are resolved out of
court, lawyers said. '

Jerome Schecter, a lawyer rep-
resenting Pine Island Ridge, said
he handles maybe one court case a
year relating to pet disputes.

“Usually, they are taken care of

, with a letter,” Schecter said.

Then the pet owner either moves
or gives up the pet, lawyers said.

The Humane Society of Broward
County ends up as the home for
“quite a lot” of pets abandoned by
owners who can’t find a place to
live, said Rick Collord, the group’s
executive director.

Out of 1,300 animals brought to

_ the shelter in June, about 340 were

surrendered by owners who could

no longer keep them, he said. '

“It’s very common,” Collord

Some cases, however, become

cause celebres, attracting media
attention and racking up legal ex-

penses. ~ .
In 1985, for example, Broward
Circuit Judge Loui's Weissing or-

dered a 68-year—old woman to give .

up her cocker spaniel despite a. he‘s
from her doctor saying the pet was

needed to relieve her depression ‘

and suicidal feelings.
“It just about blows my mind
that such a fuss came out of such a

S... .. ..-_ ‘—- 4—

relatively simple thing,” Weissing
said. “It’s just that somebody was
bound and determined they were
not going to follow the rules.”

The legal fees in the case, which
had~to be paid by the pet owner,
amounted to $35,000, said Streit-
feld, who represented the condo-
minium. /

“Can you believe it? Over a cock-
er Spaniel?” he said.

Pat Bolotin can match that.

She recently was ordered to pay
about $30,000 after the court battle
to 'keep her two dogs in her Majes-
tic View condominium in Planta-
tion. Condo rules prohibited pets
over 20 pounds and her dogs
weighed in at 38 and 48 pounds.

A Broward judge allowed her to
keep the dogs. But an appeals court
decision later sided with the condo
association. By that time, however,
the association had agreed to
“grandfather” in all existing pets
regardless of their weights.

But Bolotin still has to pick up
the tab for legal fees, forcing her to
obtain a second mortgage on her
condo to pay. '

“We lost the money but kept the
doggies,” Bolotin said. “I would do
it all over again.” ~

The Horland family hopes its
case will be settled quickly. Rich-
ard Horland said the case is “frivo-
lous” because other residents in the
Davie area condo have dogs.

But Arthur Smith, president of
the Horlands’ condo board, said
only owners are allowed to keep
pets. The Horland family is living
in a unit owned by a relative.

“We’ve been trying to get them
to remove the animal. They’ve ig-
nored our letters and attorneys,”

' Smith said. “If we allow them to

keep the dog, we are being negli-
gent to the other . . . residents.”

More Humane Research Methods

DAN MCCOY / BLACK STAR

Animals are used in fewer experiments.

SUMMARY: Responding to efforts
by Henry Spira and fellow animal
rights advocates, scientists and
companies are ﬁnding ways to get
rabbits, mice and other creatures
out of the laboratory. When
possible, researchers are turning

number of animal'rights coalitions. Since
the late 19705, he has taken an open-
minded approach to animal welfare, one
that has helped companies such as Mobil
save considerable sums in research dollars
while sparing animals needless suffering.

Spira does not advocate ending experi—
mental use of animals but simply reducing
animal pain in the most efﬁcient manner.
Three elements are critical to his goal: ﬁnd-
ing substitutes for live animals in certain
laboratory procedures; reducing the overall
incidence of animal use; and reﬁning pro-
cedures so that pain and suffering are mini-
mized. The Humane Society of the United
States shares this approach.

Some 17 million to 22 million animals
are used in laboratory experiments each
year, according to a report released late last
year by the congressional Ofﬁce of Tech-
nology Assessment. Since there are no pre-
cise records of where or how many animals
are used, these numbers are considered
poor estimates at best. The agency esti-
mates 12 million to 15 million test animals
are rats and mice. Most creatures are used
in toxicity tests for potential drugs, food
additives, pesticides and other commercial
chemicals. They are also used in medical
research and, in small numbers, in medical
and science education.

Spira’s strategy has been to focus on
routine chemical testing as the most likely
candidate for alternatives. In 1980, he took
out ads in The New York Times urging
people to write to the president of Revlon
Inc. to say they would boycott the com-
pariy’s products until it discontinued use of
the Draize eye irritancy test. In this test,
rabbits’ eyes are ﬂushed with a substance
and damage is evaluated. Spira directed
similar campaigns at other cosmetics fnms.

to be brought to bear on regulatory agen-
cies. In response to a letter from Rep. Bill
Green, a New York Republican, and more
than 70 colleagues, the Food and Drug
Administration, Environmental Protection
Agency and Consumer Product Safety
Commission decreed at a Nov. 9, 1983,
meeting that the LDSO was no longer es-
sential to acute toxicity testing.

Pharmaceutical companies have been
able to reduce the numbers of animals used
in testing by as much as two-thirds, for
example at Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.

Similar reductions have taken place at
research laboratories. Instead of running 40
to 200 animals through an LDSO, for exam-
ple, “we can take one to two animals, give
them a dose and observe what happens to
that animal within a short period of time,”
says Thomas L. Wolﬂe, deputy director of
the Ofﬁce of Animal Care and Use at the
National Institutes of Health. “If that ani-
mal dies, 3 much smaller dose is given to
another animal. That animal will be killed
and the organ systems evaluated very
closely, so that extrapolations can be made
between these two doses and the degree of
severity to the organ systems.”

At Spira’s urging, cosmetics companies
established a center for the study of alter-
natives to Draize testing at Rockefeller Uni-
versity in New York City and a center for
the study of alternatives to animal toxicity
testing at Johns Hopkins University. Both
received funding from petrochemical and
pharmaceutical companies. Dennis M.

Later, he attacked the LDSO, a test used
to evaluate toxicity by measuring the dose
required to kill 50 percent of animals tested

to cell and tissue cultures.
Already, they have eliminated
much needless suffering. '

he very notion of animal rights sets
many scientists on edge. “We are
concerned that the animal rights
movement may drive people out of re-
search,” says Steven P. Wise, a biologist at
,the National Institute of Mental Health,
which has seen laboratories broken into and
research animals set free.

Yet this spring, at a conference spon-
sored by Mobil Oil Corp., a group of sci-
entists was singing a different tune. “The
animal lovers are very good friends of
ours,” proclaimed Myron A. Mehlman,
head of toxicology testing for Mobil.

Chief among these friends is Henry
Spira of New York City, who coordinates a

(the acronymn stands for “lethal dose 50
percent”). It was used on millions of ani-
mals every year but now is used less often.

Companies responded, says Spira, by
examining how they used tests and deter-
mining if they were really necessary. “It
deﬁed common sense to put oven cleaner
in the eyes of a rabbit, particularly since
that’s not going to change anyone’s behav-
ior,” says Spira. “The big reductions [in
animal use] happened when people reas-
sessed what they really needed and whether
it was possible to get that information with
fewer animals or whether that information
was already in their ﬁles.”

Although many companies ultimately
responded favorably to Spira, pressure had

In California, protesters voice concern over treatment of labOratory animals.

Stark, Ellen Borenfreund and colleagues at
Rockefeller have developed an alternative
to Draize testing in which initancy is deter—
mined by dosing a cell culture with the
substance. A simple technique allows re-
searchers to measure the percentage of cells
that have been killed. Borenfreund says at
least ﬁve companies are testing the method.

wo techniques being developed with

money from the Johns Hopkins

Center for Alternatives to Animal

Testing have shown particular promise in

the past year, says its director, Alan M.

Goldberg. One is a new method of slicing

tissue, which greatly extends a culture’s life

and permits toxicology experiments on hu-
man and animal tissues.

The other is a new method of growing
normal, noncancerous cells. qumal cells
grow poorly in culture, while cancerous
cells grow well. But cancerous cells have

limited value as stand-ins for normal ones
in toxicity testing. Orest Hurko of Johns
Hopkins has inserted cancer genes into nor-
mal cells and developed a way to turn the
cancer gene on and off, so that he can grow
cells in a semicancerous phase and cause
them to revert to normal for testing.

The techniques that rely on tissues or
cells rather than live animals offer a variety
of advantages over traditional toxicity tests,
including the LDSO. The latter test is a
crude one that tells scientists little about
where toxicity occurs in the body and why.
Furthermore, animal tests do not necessar-
ily reﬂect how a chemical will interact with
human cells. The new methods allow sci-
entists to examine in detail the mechanisms
of toxicity. “We can look at genetic chang-
es, enzyme changes, . . chromosome
damage,” says Wolﬂe. They can also be
useful in testing the kinds of drugs that are
being developed by the genetic engineering
industry, says Goldberg. Many of these are
derived from human substances such as
hormones and could cause immunological
reactions in test animals. . .

The drawback of using tissue and cell
cultures is that they necessarily fail to du-
plicate the full complexity of the human
body. “You might have to use [animals] in
order to make sure you don’t have any
unusual interactions,” says Goldberg.

Special computer programs can provide

other alternatives to animal testing. Com-

puters can be instrumental in discovering
potential new drugs as well as in screening
chemical toxicity. Biofor Inc., a small
pharmaceutical ﬁrm in Waverly, Pa., al—
ready uses a program for both purposes.
Drugs found to be nontoxic must still be
tested in live animals, says its president,
Robert W. Naismith, but “we can reduce
animal testing by as much as 30 percent.”

Alternatives to animals are far easier to
come by in chemical testing than in bio-
medical research, concludes the congres-
sional technology ofﬁce report. Pain and
behavior are just two areas of research in

involves testing on nonhuman primates.
“We stated in 1986 that for the foreseeable
future, animals will be required in biomed—
ical and behavioral research,” says Ellis.

Nonetheless, many advocates of alter-
natives to animal testing ﬁnd considerable
scope for reducing pain and suffering in
those experiments that, for the time being
at least, remain irreplaceable. New rules
from the Department of Agriculture, which
regulates research on most higher animals,
would require review of research protocols
to ensure a minimum of pain and suffering.

As science becomes more sophisti-
cated, scientists ﬁnd ways of bypassing
animals altogether; frequently, this also
leads to improvements in the quality of
information generated. For example, the
discovery of compounds capable of reduc-
ing high blood pressure occurred during
unrelated tests on cats. While the discovery
could not have taken place without the
whole animal, any future reﬁnements of
blood pressure treatment and medication
can be made without subjecting animals to
suffering. “Now we know so much about
cell receptors involved in regulation of
blood pressure that initial screening for new
agents to treat high blood pressure can
often be done in cell culture,” says Andrew
Rowan, assistant dean of the Tufts Univer-
sity School of Veterinary Medicine.

Even in behavioral neurophysiology,
new, noninvasive techniques of brain scan-
ning are beginning to allow researchers to
see inside the living human brain to better
understand mental illnesses such as schizo-
phrenia (Insight, July 6). “I think we are
on the threshold of a renaissance in sophis-
ticated techniques that will allow re-
searchers to conduct ethical and relatively
harmless studies on human subjects,” says
Martin L. Stephens of the Humane Society.

Still, the habit of using animals is a
difﬁcult one to break. “The animal is a
fail-safe device,” concludes Rowan. “We
use animals out of ignorance.” But he
points out that time and time again, new
techniques that have replaced animals have
improved the quality of science. “What is
good for animals is good for science, and
good for human beings.”

.. IPLOMATS from 86 nations have just banned in- ,
ternational commerce in the world’s largest
parrot, the hyacinth macaw, as well as in the”

‘, . Corsican swallowtail butterfly, Ursini’s viper

’ and the star cactus, among other endangered species.

They placed new controls on trade in flying-fox bats,;
which are dinner delicacies in some Pacific islands, on r
peccaries, carnivorous pitcher plants, poison-arrow frogs
and all hummingbirds. Controls were also slapped on_

; commerce in the medicinal leech — a species under siege
3 in Eastern Europe, its last redoubt, because of global de—

' mand for its anticoagulant chemicals and the increasing
use of live leeches to help restore blood circulation when
limbs-are reattached.

For'countries belonging to the treaty to regulate the
' world’s $5 billion trade in threatened wildlife and related f";
products, these decisions, at a two-week conference that
ended Friday in Ottawa, were routine. The additions to‘
the thousands of species now under international control,
taken largely without rancor, showed how readily most
‘ nations now accept rules that 15 years ago seemed un-'
‘2 thinkable.

But the control of international commerce in wildlife~
is still suffering growing pains, hobbled by poor enforce--

' ment, scientific uncertainty and disputes about where toJ

draw the line between safe exploitation of a species and;
dangerous pillage. - . ‘7;

- ington, of the wildlife treaty. “It has
had problems, but the treaty is part of
a continuing process that I hope will
work better and better.”

‘ An encouraging recent develop-
' ment, experts said, is that more gov-

ernments are more frankly discuss-
ing the problem of lax enforcement.
Since the treaty was negotiated in
Washington in 1973, members have
pressured laggard countries heavily
‘ .involved in wildlife commerce, such
as Belgium and most recently Singa-
pore, into joining, although a few cru-
cial countries, such as Mexico, re-
main outside. And violations by
treaty members themselves, reflect-
ing corruption, incompetent enforce- ‘
mentor sometimes official decisions,
are increasingly exposed to public
scrutiny. In part this is becasue of the
increasingly effective monitoring of

. the commerce by private groups. But

i in Ottawa there was evidence of a

f new, if still wary, willingness on the

part of many governments to take

note of each others’ reported infrac-
tions and demand explanations.

Protecting the Exploited

A tension beween the urge to ex-
ploit and the urge to protect has often
bedeviled conservation efforts. Now,
in what many experts see as a bright
example of how safeguards for a spe-
cies can combine with their economic
use, the treaty countries have decided
’to reopen a line of trade that once
«f nearly killed off an animal. Peru and

Chile will be allowed to sell cloth
woven from the treasured silky wool
‘ 0f the vicuﬁa - but only if the wool is
sheared from the newly prospering
herds of live animals.

The Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
‘ Flora and Fauna, known as Cites, has
been joined by 95 countries. Private
groups, too, actively take part in its
deliberations, though they cannot
vote: in Ottawa were members of 170
groups ranging from furriers to advo-
cates of “animal rights}?

The wildlife trade is enormous, as
are the incentives to break the rules.
- Live birds and fish are avidly sought
for pets, medical research or display
in zoos; rare cacti and orchids find a
ready collector’s market. The skins
of many mammals are prized for
coats, while those of crocodiles and
other reptiles are transformed into
high-fashion purses and shoes. Rhino
horns sell for thousands of dollars
each for use as dagger handles in
Yemen and, ground up, hundreds of
dollars a pound for use in traditional
medicines in Asia. Ivory and tortoise
shell are the raw materials of time—
honored crafts with lucrative mar-
kets. ’ ‘

Among the major successes of the
treaty, experts say, has been a curb-
ing of the. once-rampant trade in skins
of large spotted cats such as the chee-
tah, jaguar, ocelot and leopard. The

most glaring failure: an inability to,
stop the slaughter of the black rhinoc-"

eros in Africa, which has plummeted
in number from 15,000 in 1980 to little
more than 4,000 today.

The vicur‘ia decision exemplifies the
treaty’s philosophy: managing, not
prohibiting trade in wildlife products
and striving to create financial incen—
tives for saving species.

Making Ivory Legal

But some delegates gulped as they
voted last week to continue, with

But "a new franknessabout treaty
infractions is an encouraging devel-
opment, said Ginette Hemley, direc-
tor of the Washington office of Traf-
fic, a private international network
that monitors international trade in
wild species. -

In documents made public in Otta-
wa, the treaty staff named some 40
member countries for suspected
violations and asked them for written
explanations. Lest unnamed coun-
tries gloat, officials noted that they
could easily have listed many more.

Burundi, which has not joined Cites,
and the United Arab Emirates, which
this year became the first member to

2 quit it, bore the harshest judgment: a

resolution called on treaty members

a to use political and economic lever-
, age to persuade the two countries to
’ end their roles as crucial transit
'. points in the movement of contraband
i ivory and rhinoceros horns to Asia.

A diplomatic mission will attempt
to visit the two countries on behalf of
the treaty powers. In addition, the
United States Government intends to
open discussions with Burundi and
the Emirates on its own, according to
Clark R. Bavin, chief of law enforce-
ment with the United States Fish and
Wildlife Service. He would not specu-
late on what "leverage, if any, might
be applied. _

argued that the chimpanzee shipment

bitter resentment at being singled

Latin American bloc to censure the
three countries provoked the hottest
and longest debate of the two-week
conference. With most countries ar-
guing for preservation of a “spirit of

BILL GRAHAM REINS IN
THE CREEPS WHO KILL
HORSES FOR PROFIT

The victim, the veterinarian told Bill Graham,
had just dropped dead in his stall. One minute a
healthy stallion, the next minute a corpse. The vet '
had done the standard autopsy and found nothing,
unusual, he said. Probable cause of death: a heart
attack.

Graham thought the probable cause was greed.
“So I handed him a bush ex and we split the skull
open,” drawls the beefy 45-year-old, not the
flinching type. They found exactly what he had
been expecting—burn marks inside the animal’s
nostrils. The horse’s owners had wired him to a
110-volt fuse box, stood him in a pool of water and
electrocuted him. Then they’d tried to collect on
the big insurance policy they were carrying on the
stallion, until a visit from Bill Graham convinced
them to drop the claim.

“I just told those a-------, ‘The public and the me-
dia might be interested in knowing you cooked
your horse.’ They saw the light," says Graham.
“The Fat Man,” he proclaims, “will find the truth.”

What is surely one of the most repulsive insUr-
ance scams running—killing horses for cash—
surfaced about five years ago, when a world oil
glut began to pinch the life-styles of the petro-
rich. Quite a few owned horses, bought at inflated
prices and expensive to maintain. Most’of the
owners swallowed and sold the steeds for a loss.
But a few cold-bloodedly reasoned that the
mounts might be worth more dead than alive.
Theyjacked up the price of the animals through a
series of paper sales, took out insurance policies
and launched a gruesome growth industry.

You can kill a horse by puncturing its bladder
with a coat hanger and waiting for infection, or by
stuffing Ping-Pong balls up its nostrils so it suffo-
cates. You can put two Alka-Seltzers in its oats
and its stomach will literally explode. You do it on
weekends or holidays, when it’s difficult to notify
the insurance company. “The Marquis de Sade
had nothing on some of today’s horse people,”
says Joan Barkley, assistant vice president of the
Rhulen AgenCy, an insurer that covers many ex-
pensive animals. “We lost millions.”

Then Barkley found Bill Graham, an ex-police-
man and security expert who was working as an
insurance investigator out of Seneca, S.C. lmag-
ine Hercule Poirot crossed with Deputy Dawg,

ing Dick Francis novel. imagine a suspendered

“Horse traders make used-car salesmen look like
nuns,” says Graham, with an admirer who Is neither.

CAN A CHlMP TRANSPLANT SAVE HUMAN LIFE?
BY NICK TAYLOR

OSEPH RIZZO HAS PRAYED
for an accident to kill a f
healthy young person of his ~
size and blood type so that
Rizzo might have the heart.
The 60-year-old Long Island
jeweler is dying, and he and '
his family are desperate. He
has spent a year on the heart-
transplant list at the Columbia-Pres-
byterian Medical Center in Manhat-
tan. But time is running out, and the
day may soon come when the heart .
surgeons approach Rizzo with a rad-
ical proposition: Would he consider

prolonging his life with the heart of a THE DONOR: Man’s closest relative helps open a'new frontier

raises. But upward of $1 million has
already gone into preparatory re-
search, one review committee has
given its approval, and the National
Institutes of Health has agreed to
back the program with a $3. 36- mil-
lion grant. It seems likely that final
approval will be given and that such
an operation will take place before
the end of 1987.

When it does, the hospital and
university expect a storm of protest,
publicity, and controversy. When
“Baby Fae” was given a baboon
heart at an obscure hospital in Lorna
Linda, California, animal-rights ad-

 

chimpanzee?

“I don’t want it,”
Rizzo said, gasping for breath as he sat in
the center’s Vanderbilt Clinic waiting for
a checkup. He was thinking about the
question for the first time. “I don’ t want
any chimpanzee. I’d rather expire. If I
can’t get the real thing now, let me go.”

His companions in the room—four
men, a woman, and a bubbly infant in a
stroller—looked on from behind their
pastel- -colored surgical masks, worn to
ward off infection. They had already re-
ceived new hearts. Their vitality spoke
volumes about the success of transplants
in cheating heart disease, the leading

44 NEW YORK/JULY 13, 1987

the heavy, balding

 

cause of death in the United States. But

there is not enough of “the real thing,”
Rizzo put it, to go around.

And so the transplant surgeons at Co-
lumbia Presbyterian are prepared to im-
plant the heart of a chimpanzee into a
human chest, Rizzo’ s or another’ 5. The
heart would be placed besidea failing
human heart and, the doctors hope, serve
as a “bridge” to sustain life until a hu-
man donor can be found.

The university and hospital are still
pondering the dizzying array of issues—
questions of animal rights and patient
consent, for example—that the plan

 

vocates marched with STOP THE
MADNESS signs. Leonard Bailey, who per-
forned that transplant, says he still gets
hate mail. Bioethics experts are split on
the question, some asserting the primacy
of human life and others calling it unfair
to animals.

Then there are questions that even the
surgeons on the transplant team have not
satisfactorily resolved. A chimpanzee
will be the donor because it is man’s clos-
est relative. Humans and chimpanzees
share 99 percent of genetic materi-
al, including blood and tissue groups and
certain immune-system characteristics.

worked for extended periods in human
recipients. But chimpanzees are an en-
dangered species, as well as beloved
creatures. For precisely these reasons,
one quails at the thought of using them.
Craig Smith, one of the surgeons who
will perform the operation, says, “I’m
wondering whether we won’t ﬁnd it hard-
er than we think.”

Columbia-Presbyterian is embarking
on this slippery slope because of an inex-
orable numbers game. This year the car-
diac-transplantation unit, headed by sur-
geon Eric Rose, has been putting healthy
human hearts—“harvested” from victims
of fatal head injuries—in patients at the
rate of more than one a week, up from 36
in all of 1986. Heart transplants are up,
but so is the number of people who need
them. The American Council on Trans-
plantation says 1,368 heart transplants
were performed last year in the United
States. A study by the Battelle Institute of
Seattle, Washington, suggests as many as
15,000 could have beneﬁted from the op-
eration. The shortage of hearts has left
people like Joseph Rizzo wanting. Al-
though, at Presbyterian Hospital this year,
the ratio has improved. with ﬁve wait-
ingelist deaths and 34 transplants
through late June, nearly a third of the
patients who need transplants die before
a heart is found. “The risk of waiting for
the operation exceeds the risk of having
it,” says Keith Reemtsma, Columbia-
Presbyterian’s chief of surgery.

If the chimpanzee heart can reduce
that risk, Reemtsma believes it will signal
an extension of what he calls “the golden
age of surgery” that began with open-
heart surgery and transplants. He can see
a vindication of his life’s work, and antic-
ipates the day when chimpanzees or other
primates may be bred to make up for the
shortage of human donors. But even he is
not sure whether he is standing at the
edge of a “frontier or an abyss.”

EEMTSMA MAY NOT BE

known outside the medical

world, but within Colum-

bia’s College of Physicians

and Surgeons he is said to ﬁt

the mold for “Hawkeye”

Pierce, the wisecracking Korean War

ﬁeld surgeon in M*A"‘S*H. Author and

retired surgeon Richard Homberger had

himself in mind when he crafted Hawk-

eye, but Reemtsma shares some of his

characteristicere arrived in Korea in

1952, fresh from the University of Penn-

sylvania and Columbia medical schools,

with a footlocker full of scotch. He

served in Inchon and Pusan and. in the

surgery tents of the First Marine Divi-

sion. The sound of evacuation helicop-

ters returning from the front remains with
him.

“When those helicopters came in, in

 

the Opening scene, I thought, ‘My God,
that’s me right there,’ ” he says. “The op-
erating-room scenes, the football game
in Tokyo, I was there. When I saw that
movie, I thought it was a documentary of
my life.” Reemtsma says that, like Hawk-
eye, he also mixes a good martini.

Among the pioneers of transplanta-
tion, names like Barnard, Shumway, and
DeBakey come to mind, but not Reem-
tsma. He is, however, an authentic trail-
blazer whose chimpanzee-to-human kid-
ney transplants at Tulane in 1963 remain
a benchmark of cross-species transplan-
tation. _

was ethically acceptable to do this,” he

 

N 1966, REEMTSMA MOVED FROM
Tulane to head the University of
Utah School of Medicine’s depart-
ment of surgery. There, he began
the artiﬁcial-heart program that led
to a more publicized experiment,
the implantation of the Iarvik-7 artiﬁcial
heart in retired dentist Barney Clark in
December 1982. Clark’s death helped
convince Reemtsma that primate hearts
are potentially better replacements in
humans than the mechanical variety.
By that time, Reemtsma had left Salt
Lake City and returned to New York and
Columbia, where he had received his sur-
gical training, to head the department of
surgery. Here, at the medical center, on

says. “No one had had any success in
[human] cadaveric grafts, and nobody
had dialysis. The patients, if they didn’t
have a brother or sister to donate a kid-
ney, had nothing.”

Reemtsma transplanted chimpanzee
kidneys into six humans in 1963 and
1964. The longest-surviving patient lived
nine months. She died not of kidney fail-
ure but of infection, which may have
been a side effect of crude anti-rejection
therapy.

Chronic dialysis and the success of
kidney transplants from human accident
victims ended Reemtsma’s experiments
in 1965. But that. early success supported
his belief that organs of one species can
support life in another for long periods.

168th Street, Reemtsma began building
an organ-transplantation program. He
added chronic dialysis, began a program
of research in immunology, and then
started transplanting kidneys. In 1977,
Reemtsma led the team of surgeons that
performed Columbia-Presbyterian’s ﬁrst
heart transplant.

By 1981, the operation was becoming
relatively frequent, if not routine. Eight
of the country’s 62 heart transplants were
performed at Presbyterian. In 1983, the
selective anti-rejection drug cyclosporine
was approved by the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration. Cyclosporine brought an
end to the “shotgun” treatment of rejec-
tion—massive doses of steroids—which
weakened the recipient’s immune sys-

RISKY BUSINESS: Dr. Keith Reemtsma knew that a chimp ’s kidneys
would work for months in a human. But there was no guarantee that
what worked with kidneys would necessarily work with the heart.

 

tem, making him prey to opportunistic
infections, much the way AIDS does. The
number of transplants has risen nearly
tenfold since then. The operation was
performed at 91 hospitals in 1986, up
from 37 in 1984, and is now often covered
by Blue Cross and Blue Shield.

All along, Reemtsma was convinced
that the next step was to place a chim-
panzee heart in a human. The people he
hired would come to believe it, too.

RIC ROSE WAS JUST 31 WHEN

Reemtsma appointed him to

head Columbia-Presbyterian’s

heart-transplant service in

1982. Craig Smith was 33 and a

sixth-year resident in surgery.
Rose did not have transplantation in
mind when he started working with
Reemtsma. But, as he puts it, “Keith is a
visionary individual.” Reemtsma sent
Rose off to the famous Stanford trans-
plant program and told him to “be a
sponge” and return to make Columbia-
Presbyterian a leader in heart transplan-
tation.

Smith, however, began performing a
growing share of the hospital’s heart
transplants. Starting with 9 in 1983, he
performed 29 of the hospital’s 36 in 1986,
and 19 in the first five months of 1987,
but he no longer keeps count. “I don’t
know, 70, 80, 90,” he says. “It was sur-
prising how quickly I lost track. It kind of
gets under your skin and takes on a life of
its own.”

Both Smith and Rose now share
Reemtsma’s vision. “The quintessential
problem in heart transplantation for the
future is donors. You’ve got to think be-
yond human donors,” says Rose.

For a surgeon, the lure of heart trans-
plantation is partly its pure excitement.
The timing is as unpredictable as the vio-
lent tragedies—mostly traffic accidents
and gunshot wounds—that provide the
donors. Rose compares it to being a
fireman.

Eighty percent of the low-risk patients
who have received hearts at Columbia-
Presbyterian have survived four years or
longer. Even a majority (about 60 per-
cent) of high-risk patients—people with
diabetes or an ulcer, or whose lungs have
been weakened by prolonged heart dis-
ease—live for a year or more after a heart
transplant. “These are people who would
otherwise be dead within a year,” says
Rose.

The best way to lose a patient, then, is
never to enter the operating room. The

law to be sought from a donor’s family.
But nearly half the families, many
simply distraught and others ignorant of
the need, turn down the requests. Faye
Davis, the Regional Transplant Pro-
gram’s executive director, wants to raise
the donation rate to 80 percent, the na-
tional average.

But, she says, “no matter what we do,
there won’t ever be enough.”

Rose and his colleagues considered
mechanical hearts. Robert Iarvik, inven-
tor of the Iarvik-7, made a sales call to
Rose’s office. By then the Iarvik heart had
proved a mixed blessing. Though it kept
patients alive—William I. Schroeder,
who followed Clark, lived for twenty
months—it caused increased clotting
and strokes. Its external machinery was
cumbersome and wheezy—like a massive
vacuum cleaner tethered to a patient.
Rose saw the Iarvik as a “bridge,” but
nothing more.

“Our view is that it’s a bridge to no-
where,” says Rose. “If there are no more
donors at the end of the rainbow, a
bridge becomes irrelevant.” The primate
heart seemed to offer possibilities both as
a bridge and, if the problem of rejection
could be overcome, a permanent re-
placement.

ERIOUS GROUNDWORK BEGAN

in the fall of 1984. Reemtsma

knew that a chimpanzee’s kid-

neys would work for months in

a human. But there was no

guarantee that what had
worked with kidneys would work with
the heart. Only three primate-to-human
heart transplants had ever been done;
one patient lived for three and a half
days, but the others died within hours.
All were done before the advent of
cyclosporine.

Rejection occurs in every transplant.
The body’s white blood cells sense the
presence of a foreign organ and attack it,
destroying the new organ’s muscle cells.
The ability of cyclosporine to tamp down
that reaction without compromising the
entire immune system has made human-
to-human transplants viable. Crossing
species barriers makes the reaction more
severe. The wider the gap from one spe-
cies to another, the more dangerous the
reaction.

 

The Columbia-Presbyterian surgeons
wanted to test a variety of modern im-
mune-suppression drugs on animals
closely related to man. They decided to
transplant the hearts of cynomolgus
monkeys into baboons. The evolutionary
leap between the two is roughly the same
as from chimpanzee to man. The doctors
reasoned that the drugs that would help a
baboon accept a monkey’s heart might
also help a human accept a chimpan-
zee’s.

The series of primate transplants was
barely under way when, on October 26,
1984, Bailey, at Loma Linda, replaced a
dying baby’s heart with the walnut-size
heart of a ten-week-old baboon. When
the news broke on that Sunday, Rose’s
wife brought him a copy of the New York
Times and said, “Somebody beat you
to it.”

“Baby Fae” lived for just three weeks,
but that didn’t discourage doctors at C0-
lumbia-Presbyterian. For one thing, the
baboon’s blood type did not match the
infant’s, and matching blood types are
common in successful transplantations.

Robert Michler, then a 27-year-old
third-year surgical resident, did many of
the early primate operations. He trans-
planted a monkey heart the size of a lime
into a pocket under a muscle in a ba-
boon’s neck. The heart was tied into the
baboon’s bloodstream, but it would not
have to do the work of keeping the larger
animal alive. It could be seen and felt un-
der the skin, and so could be checked
without additional surgery, and the even-
tual “death” of this heart would not harm
the baboon. Later, the surgeons would
transplant monkey hearts into the “work-
ing” position in baboons in place of
their own hearts.

In a series of six control transplants
with no immune suppression, the hearts
lived for about a week.

Michler, tall and soft-spoken, kept de-
tailed notes on lined, three-holed paper
in a series of blue plastic ring binders.
He wrote in a succinct, leftward—leaning
script as he recorded the results of the
operations and his daily checks on the
animals.

On January 28, 1985, Michler implant-
ed a monkey’s heart into the right side of
the neck of baboon No. 408/14. The ani-
mal received doses of cyclosporine and
Depo-Medrol, a steroid, in an anti-rejec-
tion regimen much like that given human
transplant recipients. Michler wrote,
“Recipient operation performed smooth-
ly. No postop bleeding.”

 




—

 

The next day, he noted that the animal
was “very active and alert.”

Nine days after the operation—“POD
9,” in Michler’s shorthand—he observed
“good, strong visible pulsations of the
heart.”

On POD 30, February 27, Michler let
his feelings show: “Hurray! 1 mos. and a
very strong palpable and visibly beating
heart.” He also observed that 408/14
“seems to be getting more friendly.” The
baboon showed “no infection” and was
“eating well.”

On POD 60, March 29: “Palpable
heart. Animal looks well.”

On POD 80, April 18, bad news greet-
ed Michler. He wrote, “Very difficult to
feel heart.” He performed an electrocar-

diogram, and found the heart to be beat-

ing weakly. The next
day, it had stopped. 7
“Heart not palpable,” "
he wrote.

But the surgeons ;
now had reason to be-
lieve that drugs used
to fight rejection in
human-heart trans-
plants would work in
cross-species trans-
plants. The results
were borne out in ten
other baboons.

Those were heady
days in the detached
and objective world of
science. Michler .

knowing glances with
Rose and Reemtsma
when they encoun-
tered one another in
the hospital corridors.

says. “I can remember

was tough to know that she was a control
and she was scheduled to die.”

In a human patient, rejection would be
treated. In the baboon experiments,
where the emphasis was on the initial im-
mune suppression, it was not. On the
morning Michler found the baboon list-
less, with no interest in eating or drink-
ing, he recognized the signs of rejection
and injected an instantly fatal potassium
solution to end its life.

The disappointing results of the work-
ing-heart transplants nonetheless left
Rose determined to move ahead. “We
haven’t got the magic bullet here for xen-
otransplantation,” he says, using the
medical argot for a cross-species trans-
plant. “But thank God all medical re-
search is not always done by the num-

such areas as AIDS and hepatitis makes
primatologists reluctant to see them used
as heart donors.

Ian Moor-Iankowski, director of the
Laboratory for Experimental Medicine
and Surgery in Primates, in Orange
County, says it costs about $30,000 to
raise a chimp to two years of age at his
facility. He says he could not give up
chimps as heart donors without some na-
tional policy favoring such use. But
LEMSIP (the laboratory’s acronym) al-
ready has agreed to provide ABO blood--
group typing of the donor chimps, so
they may be matched to human recipi-
ents. It also could provide a place to
house the animals until they are needed
at Columbia—Presbyterian.

HE CHAIN

of events

leading to

the opera-

tion will

begin with

' a patient for whom a
human heart cannot
be found and who is
out of options. Rose
describes the likely pa-
tient as one “who is
on all the medica-
. tions that we have to
offer, probably on an
intra-aortic balloon
pump, and who shows
continued deteriora-
tion despite all this.”
Long before the pa-

tient reaches a critical
stage, he will have
consented to the op-
eration. Reemtsma
wants to be sure the

"“‘“‘~ patient, as well as his
family, “understands

 

feeling excitement.”
Later results proved less heartening.
When the monkeys’ hearts were placed
in the working position, survival periods
in the control group, without immune
suppression, actually increased. The first
baboon given a working monkey heart
lived sixteen days. “We thought this was
incredible, the answer of the century,”
says Craig Smith. “But it’s turned out not
to be.” Only four of the eleven immune-
suppressed baboons outlived the con-
trols. One, however, lived for 50 days.
All along, the researchers fought
against becoming too involved with the
baboons. They purposely declined to
name the animals. Smith, recalling how
they were rooting for the first baboon
with the working monkey heart, says,
“We all got very attached to that animal.

ing her. That monkey got so attached to

Importing endangered species is against
the law, so they must be bred at a handful
of primate-research facilities around the

duces about 100 baby chimps a year. The

That is one reason the patient is not
likely to be a baby or a young child. The
other is the potential for suffering.
“There can be one of three outcomes to a
heart procedure,” says Rose. “One is you
do great. Two is that you die early, with a
limited amount of suffering. The third,
and the worst, is to live for months with
constant complications and die a diffi-
cult death. Inﬂicting that on a newborn,
or a child, I find very difficult.”

Although no patient has been ap-
proached, Rose anticipates that sdme pa-
tients, like Joseph Rizzo, will greet the
idea with reluctance, and some will turn
the operation down. “We have no plans
for twisting their arms,” he says. But he
points out that patients were reluctant to
receive human hearts before the opera-
tion became more or less routine.

inject the recipient with cyclosporine
and steroids so the immune-suppressive
drugs will be in his bloodstream and
ready to go to work when the new heart
is implanted. As surgery begins, donor
and recipient operations must be closely
coordinated.

URGEONS WILL REMOVE THE
chimpanzee’s heart in a labora-
tory operating room. The ani-
mal will be anesthetized. The
chest will be opened and the
heart cut free and stopped with
a cold high-potassium solution poured
into a catheter inserted in the aorta. The
heart will be immersed and kept cool,
about 40 degrees Fahrenheit, in a saline
solution on its trip to the operating room.

Three surgeons, two profusionists (to
run the heart-lung machine), two anes-
thesiologists, two scrub nurses, and a
physician’s assistant will be waiting. The
patient’s chest should be open, split prac-
tically from neck to navel to the accom-
paniment of rock music. Rose likes rock
to open and close—“It speeds people up.
You need it”——but prefers classical for
the precision work of grafting the heart
in place. Wisecracks ﬂy back and forth
during a normal heart-transplant proce-
dure, typical of doctors who dare to hold
life in their hands, but Rose suspects the
chimp heart will be implanted with a se-
riousness beﬁtting scientists who aren’t
sure what will happen next.

The operation will differ from the rou-
tine in one other major respect. The re-
cipient’s heart will not be removed. In-
stead, the new heart will be nestled to its
right and connected, aorta to aorta, pul-
monary artery to pulmonary artery, with
polypropylene monoﬁlament, which is
like ﬁshing line. The two hearts would be
indistinguishable if one were not dis-
eased, but the chimpanzee heart will be
the redder and more vital of the two.

The chimp heart may start beating on
its own. If not, the paddles of an electric
deﬁbrillator will be placed against the
heart to shock it into life. A beating heart
will signal that the worst case—hypera-
cute rejection, in which the heart simply
does not start—has not occurred. Once it
starts, Rose expects the new heart to take
over from the old; both hearts will beat,
but the chimp heart will assume the bur-
den of pumping blood through the recip-
ient’s body.

At that point—some ﬁve hours after it
began, if all goes well—the chest will be
closed and the surgery, the battle, will be

out of apes and putting them in little

couldn’t ask for anything more lurid than
that. This is the National Enquirer, front-

chimps Will be dispatched far more hu-
manely than animals that are the subjects
of ongoing drug, cosmetics, and psycho-
logical-distress tests. Michael W. Fox, the
scientiﬁc director of the Humane Society
of the United States, calls it a question of
the “sanctity of being.”

“To sacriﬁce an endangered species to
save an endangered individual is a wrong
relationship with the Whole of creation,”
says Fox. “This attitude of [human] supe-
riority is laying waste the animal
world.”

Murry I. Cohen is a New York psychia-
trist who serves on the board of the Medi-
cal Research Modernization Committee,
an offshoot of Friends of Animals, which
reviews animal experiments on an ad hoc
basis. “It is not axiomatic that it’s worth
killing a baboon to save a child,” he
says. “We’re not talking about a parame-
cium. A baboon and gorillas and chim-
panzees and orangutans are very close to
us. They’re biological 'cousins, and there
is an argumentagainst using them.”

Bonnie Steinbeck, a self-described ani-
mal-rights moderate who teaches philos-
ophy at the State University of New York
at Albany, ﬁnds “chilling” the prospect
of raising baboons or chimps to be
harvested.

Arthur L. Caplan, director of the Cen-
ter for Biomedical Ethics at the Universi—
ty of Minnesota, predicts a “storm of
controversy” if that day comes, and fore-
sees animal farms heavily fortified
against raids by animal-rights militants.

David Rothman is one expert in medi-
cal ethics who believes that “we have the
moral right to rescue humans by the use
of nonhuman hearts.” Rothman heads
the medical college’s Center for the
Study of Society and Medicine. He meets
with the heart-transplant team on ethical
issues. Rothman’s opinion is important,
since he is also a member of Colum-
bia-Presbyterian’s Institutional Review
Board, which will act this month on
Rose’s protocols. He has served on a sub-
committee of the board that supports do-
ing the operations for scientiﬁc reasons.

president Thomas O. Morris and medi-

cal-school dean Henrik Bendixen will

take up legal and administrative ques-
tions.

Finally, the twelve-member IRB will

“consider such questions as how consent

will be obtained, how the experiments
will be monitored, and how the decision
will be made to proceed with the opera-
tion. “What happens,” board chairman
Norman Kahn asks, “if they put in a

human heart becomes available? At this
point, they have a bridge arrangement
that is not a study of long-term survival

at 61, he slumps on a sofa in his bright,
fourteenth-ﬂoor ofﬁce with its view
across Manhattan and its statuette of
two brass-faced chimpanzees on the
shelves beside his desk. “It’s a real
question. Should you use a higher non-
human primate to save a human life?” he
asks.

“When you look to the future and
wonder if a hundred years from now peo-

XiU-Hua finds weather

a disagrecab

 

By John Beifuss
.p' Staff Reporter

 

When Xiu-Hua the giant panda makes
her public debut at 9 am. today, she al-
. ready will have experienced the typical ex-
tremes of Memphis weather — bad and
worse.

Yesterday morning, the bearlike visitor
from the Chapultepec Park Zoo in Mexico
City was allowed to play in her outdoor
yard for the first time. But because of the
heat and humidity, she was brought back
into the air-conditioned indoor exhibit
after about 90 minutes.

Yesterday afternoon, employees of the,

Memphis Zoo ,were viewing the panda in-
side the Primate House — where she will
be living during her stay in Memphis -—
when a sudden, violent storm erupted.
Wind and rain lashed the roof of the exhi-
bit, creating a loud banging noise that
frightened the roly-poly, black-and-white
mammal. Xiu-Hua instinctively sought
shelter in the small corridor between her
indoor and outdoor pens, and sought sol-
ace by chewing on her favorite food —
ripe, red apples. '

Before the storm, however, Xiu-Hua did
what she does best: sat, strolled and rolled
around while looking cute.

“Say hello, baby,” Marielena Hoyo Bas-
tien, administrator of the Chapultepec
Park Zoo, said through the glass of the ex
hibit. When the animal didn’t respond, Ms.
Hoyo told the onlookers: “She doesn’t
speak English.” ._. -

Ms. Hoyo said Xiu-Hua will be on display
in Memphis until Sept. 4 -— four days 1011;;-
er than previously announced. Slit: Said
the extension was “to show our apprecia-

tion to Memphis. I’d like her to stay one .

year, but even one month is a compromise
for the Mexican people.” ~
. Memphis Zoo officials say they will be

 

16 subject

ready for the crowding expected to begin
today when legions of panda fans arrive at
the zoo.

Twelve additional security guards and

' seven additional cashiers have been hired

for the month. -

Four extra soft-drink stands and two ice
cream stands have been set up at the zoo. In
addition, two soft-drink vendors will work
the lines leading to the panda. °

About 1,100 temporary parking spaces
have been added to the 535 existing spaces
in Overton Park. Traffic routes in the park
also have been altered to handle the flow
of visitors.

“We don’t want a bad experience,” said
Charles Wilson, zoo director. “We are ex-
pecting a big crowd, and we .are prepared
to handle it.”

He said zoo officials hope 200,000 visitors
will View the panda. The 200’s previous
record attendance for amonth was set in
May 1985, when 155,442 people viewed
Ayers the koala. '

Xiu-Hua (pronounced Shoo wah), who
arrived in Memphis Thursday, is the first
giant panda to visit the South, and the first
panda to visit the United States indepen-
dent of Chinese government control.

, The zoo is open daily from 9 am. to 6 pm,
with last admittance at 5 pm. Tickets are
$2.25 for adults and $1 for senior citizens
and children 2 to 11. Visitors will be re-
quired to stand in line to see the panda, but
there is no extra admission charge. Admis-
sion to the zoo is free from 3:30 to 5 pm. Sat-
urdays.

The 35 days of panda viewing will kick
off with a ribbon-cutting ceremony today
at 9.18:? am.

The. panda will be fed about 11 am. and 4
p.n:‘.fe‘ach day.

The ”panda probably will be outdoors
only 1' or a short time in the morning, but
the time period may be increased as Xiu-
Hua adapts to the Memphis climate.

LOOKING FOR THAT SIGNIFICANT UDDER?
TRY CALLING THE PANAGAKOS FAMILY AND
THEIR NEW AGENCY, ADOPT-A-COW

“Each cow is different,” says Steven Panagakos, as kids Jason and Jessica help one of the adoptees, Lady, celebrate her birthday.

The concept couldn’t be simpler.

anowho has everything,” says Suzanne

adoption certificate, a chance to name
the bossy and throw it birthday parties,
visitation rights on one Sunday per
month and the right to earn up to half
of her calves’ adoption fees.

The idea was born when Steven, 34,
bought the‘ farm late last year. Al-
though he owns two local seafood res-
taurants, both of which also serve
beef, he says, “I just couldn’t sell my
nine Herefords for slaughter. I grew at-
tached to them. They have their own
personalities.” After buying six more
head, Panagakos started Adopt-A-
Cow in May and claims he’s since then
found parents for all 15 heifers. While

neighbors find the notion of cow adop-
tion a bitter afield, the local chapter of
the ASPCA, at least, thinks the idea is
worth milking. “Sure, it’s a way of mak-
ing money,” says the chapter’s execu-
tive director, Lionel Hetu, “but so is
slaughtering animals.” Ironically,
Adopt-A-Cow’s biggest achievement
so far is bringing the Panagakos fam-
ily—including Jason, 7, and Jessica,
5—back together. Steven and Su-
zanne have been divorced for three
years, but, says Steven, “the farm has
given us a focus and reunited us.”

pit bulls aren’t the problem. They say it’s humar
who breed and raise the animals improperly. The
echo the National Rifle Association’s claim that it
people, not guns that kill . ‘

The argument is facile but fallacious. The so
function of handguns is killing. And bull terrier
however amiable they appear, have a mark of Cai
in their genetic history: They were first bred not 1

. retrieve game or herd sheep but to kill in fierc

combat. Why shouldn’t concerned neighbors an
city councils seek curbs?

Because, claim defenders, bloodlines are 5
mixed there’s no scientifically valid way to proi
just which dog is a pit bull. Instead of singling o
pit bulls, states and localities should strengths
their “dangerous- dog” ordinances. Typically, ti.
laws require special registration, bonds and liabi
ity insurance when a dog of any breed has a histox
of biting. On a second offense the dog can t
confiscated and the owner fined or imprisoned

A model “dangerous- dog” bill, just passed i
Washington state, goes further. Even before bit(
of humans are recorded, it makes a dog’s aggre
sive or intimidating behavior, including attacks c
other animals, a trip wire for special controls.

There is real question whether “dangerous- do;
ordinances will deter many of the back- -alley type
now breeding pit bulls for ill purpose. Or that tl
laws will stop rural thugs like the bunch in Gran
Pass, Ore., recently found to have 25 pit bul
chained around their 2,345-plant marijuana farm.

But South Pasadena, Calif., dog owners made
solid point in a recent letter to the editor: “V
Americans must be the only people in the industi
alized world who stoically watch free-roamii
dogs ravage trash cans, terrorize children, sca:
off natural wildlife, reproduce rampantly, k

fields of feces.”

U.S. animal-control laws are a neglected mes

Canine therapists aid Victims of head injuries

By Tom Boone
or THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

Justin McAden, 9-year-old kid, met
Lady, a mostly miniature schnauzer with
a pink hat, Thursday afternoon, and the
relationship bloomed.

Justin is from Denison. He’s a chubby
guy with a burr haircut. Lady has white
hair and likes to chase whatever some-

one will throw for her. They look like
ordinary boy and dog, but in truth nei-
ther is ordinary at all.

Justin is recovering from a head injury
he suffered April 24 when a car crashed
into his bicycle as he rode to school. And
though he appears to be physically
sound, his mind plays strange tricks on
him. .

And Lady. owned bv Virginia Hvatt of

Arlington, is one of only a few dogs in
the' Dallas area trained to take part in
recreational therapy for patients of nurs— ,
ing homes, hospitals and other medical
facilities.

On Thursday; Hyatt and other dog,
owners who are members of an organiza- '

tion she formed were at Dallas Rehabili ;

Please see DOGS, 8-3}

 




-'DOGSH'

From 3-!

 

tation Institute on Harry Hines
Boulevard to visit some boys and
girls -— all victims of head inju-
ries —— who might enjoy a little
hairy company and who might,
just might, respond to the dogs
more positively than they re-
spond to their human therapists.

On one side of the recreational
therapy room at DRI, Lady dem-
onstrated skills at retrieving a
number of objects, while on the
other side of the room Sugar
Bear, 3 black pekapoo, alternately"
sat up and played “dead dog.”

Responses from the half—dozen
children varied according to the
severity of their injuries. Justin
was animated, but 17-year-old
Michael Guynes of Arlington,
who suffered profound brain
damage during football practice
at Martin High School in Arling-
ton last year, was able only to
raise a hand, slowly, when it was
time to return to his room.

Hyatt’s organization is called

Paws Across Texas, and it con-
sists of more than two dozen dog
owners and their pets, which
range in size from a 120-pound
Irish wolfhound to a 3—pound
dachshund.

To become members, dog own—
ers must have put their pets
through obedience school and
met other requirements, mostly
health—related. Training includes,
preparing the dogs to be around
wheelchairs.

The dogs are “used as tools to
motivate, stimulate, help decrease
depression and boost morales” at
the more than 30 institutions they
visit, Hyatt said. Response from
medical personnel has been en-
couraging, she said, and the
group is seeking new members,
especially in the Dallas area.

Patty Schaller, manager of rec-
reation and leisure services at
Dallas Rehabilitation Institute,
says the dogs have been a wel-
comed addition to therapy pro-

grams.

“I’ve seen those patients recov-
ering from head injuries respond-
ing,” she said. “They respond to
the softness. They’ll reach out

and touch them, or maybe they’ll
draw away when the dog licks
them in the face. They may not
respond that way to humans.

“Dogs have an unconditional
love for people. It doesn’t matter
who they are. There’s a warmth
of feeling from the animal, and I
think they respond to that. It’s re—
ally, really working.”

Though the weekly visits from
the dogs may be a bright spot in
the lives of the youngsters at the
rehabilitation center, they’ll never
be able to undo all the damage
that has been done.

Justin, for instance, may need
10 to 15 years before he returns
to normal, his mother, Lisa McA—
den, said.

“He has lost some of his memo-
ry,” she said. “For instance he
doesn’t know how to add. He was
hit on one side of his head, and it
has affected how his brain con-
trols the other side of his body.
When he colors a picture, he col-
ors it only from the middle to the _
right side. If you ask him to
count the numbers on a clock
he’ll count from one to six, and
he’ll think he’s through.”

THE DEKALB NEWS/SUN- Atlanta - 8/5/87

DeKcIIb Animal Law Puts
 Responsibi|iiy On Owners

News coverage about attacks by
‘pit bull dogs has resulted in nu-
merous telephone calls to the De-
Kalb County Commission Office
and DeKalb’s Animal Control
Unit, according to DeKalb Chief

Executive Ofﬁcer Manual J. Ma— ,

loof.

“I think we need to do a better
job of letting our citizens know
about the speciﬁc changes in the
animal ordinance adopted by the
. board of commissioners last April,”
Maloof said. .

The ordinance deﬁnes dangerous
animals as “any animal which
constitutes a physical threat to
human beings or other domestic
animals by virtue of a known
propensity to endanger life by an
unprovoked assault or bite so as to
cause serious bodily harm.”

Any animal that is trained. or
owned for the purpose of animal
fighting is deemed a dangerous
animal by the ordinance. Animals
are considered a public nuisance if
they are found roaming at large,
unlicensed, or if trained for the
purpose of dog ﬁghting, or if they
are dangerous. Animals which
produce vunsanitary conditions or
endanger the public health, wel-
fare or safety are also considered a
public nuisance under the animal
ordinance.

THE OWNERS of animals that
are dangerous or a public nuisance
may be charged. Upon conviction,
the animal owner may be ﬁned up
to $500 and/or be imprisoned in
the county jail for up to 30 days
per offense under the ordinance.

“The penalties for violating the
ordinance are stiffer than under
the previous law,” said Sgt. Har-
vey Pearson, assistant commander
of the Animal Control Unit.

“The ordinance spells out the
responsibility of animal owners,”
Sgt. Pearson said.

. The ordinance says, “it shall be
the duty of every owner of any
animal, or anyone having any ani-
mal In their possession or custody,
to exercise reasonable care and to
take all necessary steps and pre-
cautions to protect other people,
property, and animals from inju-
ries or damage which might result

g from their ammal’s behavior, re-
i gardless of whether such behavior
? is motivated by mischievousness,
_. playfulness, or ferocity.”

Animal owners must “ensure

' that their animals are kept under

restraint and that reasonable care
and precautions are taken to pre-
vent the animals from leaving” the
owner’s property.

Owners are required to securely
and humanely keep their animals
enclosed in “a house, building,
fence, pen, or other enclosure out
of which they cannot climb, dig,
jump, or otherwise escape on their
own violation.”

The ordinance also requires the
enclosure to be securely locked
when an animal is left unattended.

An owner may choose to se-
curely and humanely restrain
their animal “by chain, cable or
trolley, or other tether of sufﬁcient
strength to prevent escape,” as
required by the ordinance.

IF AN ANIMAL is not re-
strained or enclosed on the owner’s
property, it must be on a leash and
under the control of a competent
person or off the leash but obedient
to that person’s command, but only
as long as it remains on the
owner’s property.

Whenever outside of its enclo-
sure, a dangerous dog must be

, attended by the owner and re-

strained by as secure collar and
leash to prevent escape.

Sgt. Pearson said a key require-
ment of the ordinance does not
permit a dangerous animal to be
chained, tethered or tied to a tree,
post or building outside of its en-
closure.

Owners of dangerous animals
are required to keep their animals
humanely conﬁned inside a pen or
kennel and that pen must be
within a fenced portion of the
owners’s property. The pen must
not share a common fence" with the

‘ perimeter fence, Pearson said.

The ordinance requires the

. “kennel or pen to have secure

sides; a secure top attached to all
sides; the sides must either be

_ buried two feet into the ground,

sunken into a concrete pad, or
securely attached to a wire bottom.

The gate to the kennel must be

 

locked,” according to the ordi-

' nance.

The owner of an animal or any-
one having an animal in their
possession has the duty to keep the

; animal under restraint and control

at all times while off the owner’s

or possessor’s property.

TO COMPLY with the ordi-

nance, an animal off the owner’s
property must be conﬁned within a
vehicle while parked or in motion;
conﬁned within a secure enclosure
with the permission of the owner of
the enclosure; or restrained by a
leash or other device held by a
competent person.

Whenever a dangerous animal is

1, off the owner’s property it must
~ also be attended by the owner and
. restrained by a secure collar and
, leash of sufﬁcient strength to pre-
vent escape. The animal must also
be muzzled to prevent biting other
persons or domestic animals.

Sgt. Pearson said animal control

ofﬁcers were given added enforce-
ment authority by the ordinance.

“If a DeKalb animal control

officer has probable cause to be-
lieve a dangerous animal is being
kept in violation of the provisions
of the ordinance, he or she may
order the owner to immediately
a correct the violation and give the
owner a citation to appear in court
5;; for the violation,” Pearson said. 7,

“In situations that the violation

cannot be immediately corrected
and when the animal is posing an
imminent serious threat to human
1 beings or other animals, the ani-
mal control ofﬁcer may seize the
animal and issue a citation to the
.. owner,” he said.

If the court rules that the ani-
mal is not dangerous as deﬁned by

. the ordinance, it will be released to
‘_ the owner. If the court rules that
the animal is dangerous as de-

ﬁned, the animal will be released
to its owner after payment of any
fees and penalties, and upon pres-
entation of proof that the animal
will be kept restrained or conﬁned
as speciﬁed by the ordinance, Pear-
son said.

The ordinance provides that if
the owner of an impounded animal

‘ fails to reclaim the animal within
15 days, and if it cannot be adopted
' by someone proyidinglproofth'atit“.

 




f will be kept restrained or conﬁned

as required by the ordinance, the
animal will be humanely euthan-
ized. A

“A citizen’s advisory committee
worked diligently with the Board
of Commissioners to draft revisions
to the animal ordinance. It’s a
comprehensive document that
leaves no doubt about an animal
owner’s responsibility,” Maloof
said. ‘ '

“Our animal control ofﬁcers are
enforcing the ordinance. We urge
every animal owner to obtain a
copy of the ordinance and to abide
by the provisions set forth,” he

said.

Racing pigs attract
crowds across nation

By Rhonda Shouu
WARREN counrv BUREAU

LEBANON --- They may have to run,
waddle or roll, but they’ll make it
across the finish line.

They are the newest stars of the rac-
ing world —- pigs.

Draggin’ Lady, Miami Hammy and

Belly Buster II are just a few of the
celebrated racing pigs making an ap-
pearance. at this year’s Warren County
Fair, which ends today. '

Pig racing has become a major at-
traction at state and county fairs
around the United States, said Jim
Windland, owner and trainer of racing
pigs.

“We hit the entertainment market at
just the right time,” he said. “If we’d
hit it 10 years earlier or 10 years later.
it probably wouldn’t be such a
success.“

The five races today are at 1:30, 3:30,

5:30. 7:30 and 9:30pm. at the county 1

fairgrounds, off Ohio 48 just north of
Lebanon.

Windland and his wife, Sandi, who

also is a trainer, have appeared with the

pigs on PM Magazine, ESPN and The

Tonight Show With Johnny Carson.

The two work with one of three teams _‘

The ugly -- but cute -- Potbellied
pigs are so called because their short
; legs can’t keep their bellies from brush-
ing the ground.

Along with the Potbellied pigs are
:themorefamilar Polish- American pigs.

The team consists of 15 pigs, includ- I,
ing five rare Potbellied pigs, 3 Special

 

The racing pigs all weigh under 100

: pounds.

The pigs race on a ISO-foot fenced

3 track, which is carpeted with pine

shavings. The pigs can make it around

the track in about a minute.

The Windlands, who trained circus

‘ animals for 22 years, agreed that pigs

are fast learners.

“They quickly learned the inside
‘ track is shorter,” Mrs. Windland said.
But what is a pig’s inspiration to

win?
An Oreo cookie.

‘\

Figs are known to have a sweet tooth

‘ and these are no exception.

Windland said, “The winner gets the

' Oreo and the losers get the crumbs.”

What’s more, these pigs are particu-

' lar. The Windlands said the pigs won’t

touch other brands of cookies.

“When the bell goes off, they have
one thing in their mind —- Oreo,"
Windland said.

The racers are accompanied by their
mascot, Tyrone the Terrible. Tyrone is
the first Potbellied pig born in the Unit-
ed States, the Windlands said. Tyrone’s
favorite foods are Frosted Mini-Wheats

‘ and yogurt-covered raisins.

Mrs. Windland said, “Little Tyrone
doesn’t like pigs. He doesn’t realize he’s

The pigs soon will be traveling to
Disneyland where they’ll be a feature

past few weeks in forests earmark— -
ed for logging near this New Eng- '
land-style Vlllage on the Pacific -

“shore"about 200 miles north of San
Francisco.

The spikes, driven into . trees
about eight feet above. ground lev-

Sel,‘a‘re the latest escalation in a -

battle oVer long-term plans for the j
4 future ofthescenic national for-
‘ests that. take in almost 20 millionv“

acres of rural northern California.
“Environmental extremists have

threatened to spike trees through-

out" the...\region‘if the US. Forest
~ Service persists in plans to in-
crease logging activity, livestock
grazing, off-road vehicle use and
road-building.

The thickiron spikes can shatter
saw blades and other lumber-pro-
cessing equipment. A worker in a
sawmill near here suffered severe
cuts and a broken jaw last month
’ when struck by a saw blade sent

flying by a previously unnoticed,

spike .

The spiking episodes fellowed a
bitter exchange betWeen the
160,000—member Wilderness Society
: and the Forest Service over forest
management plans.

Those plans call for a 9 percent

increase in clear-cutting of “old-
growth” trees, the largest and best
4 established growth in the forests.

Environmentalists argue that

clear cutting -- where virtually ev- -

1 ery tree in an area is harvested,

WWI-9..

rather than only selected trees --
causes erosion that pollutes
streams, harms wildlife, and de-
stroys the aesthetic and recre-
ational value of the forests.
The Wilderness Society said the
Forest Service has flouted the 1976

National Forest Management Act _

and is “destroying irreplaceable
natural resources (while). .tax-

- payers are losing billions of dollars

supporting below-cost timber
sales. ”

HE NEW FOREST Service
plans are mandated by that

law, which calls for drafting ..

new management plans for each of
the 107 national forests.

The 1976 law allows clear-cutting
but forbids below cost timber

, sales. The Wilderness Society

claims that some past timber sales
have brought less money than the
sales cost to arrange because they
involved cutting in steep 0r inac-
cessible areas that should have
been left outrof the sales.

The Forest Service answers that
the environmentalist charges “do

‘ not accurately reﬂect the situa-

tion.”
California regional forester Zane

' Smith reported in June thatlumber

sale receipts in the affected forests
averaged $150 million annually for
the last eight years, compared
with an annual average timber
management cost of $102 million

“This does not reﬂect below-cost
sales,” he told a reporter.

The Forest Service also argues

that its plans will increase more '

‘Usher’ and his dog restore
peace, quiet to movie theater

 

My friend Roger Simon
wrote a column the other
day complaining about how
people talk in movie the-
aters, ruining the movies
for the rest of the audience.

said, ‘Either shut up or
leave.’ And that still didn’t
quiet them down.”

And if things were de-
pressing during the night-
time showings of the mov-

 

Simon observed:
“As a kid, I made noise in
movies. All kids do. But

 

ies, they were even more
dismal in the mornings,
when the janitors had to

 

 

'when we did, ushers would
head for us like guided mis-
siles. They would shine
their flashlights on us, and we would hunch down and
‘ shut up. .

“But when is the last time you saw that happen?
“When is the last time you saw an usher actually
. usher?

“For that matter, when 18 the last time you saw an
usher?

“(Theater owners) should face the truth. They gave
up control of their theaters long ago. And all that
most of them do these days is take your money and
sell you popcorn.”

Well. in the long ago, Simon and I used to sit at
adjacent desks in the same newsroom. If that were
still the case, I would tell him in person what I am
about to tell you in the column. Simon and I live in
different cities now, so I will have to do this in print.

Simon apparently has never heard of the Jackson
Mall Cinema in Jackson, Miss. -

At the Jackson Mall Cinema, people talked during
the movies all the time. In addition to the constant
yapping, patrons reportedly smoked marijuana in the
restrooms, brought liquor into the theater, engaged in
, name-calling and profanity, stole food from behind
the concession stand and fought in the aisles.

So Phillip Clark, district supervisor for United
Cinemas of America, which leases the" Jackson Mall
Cinema, came up with a plan.

He didn’t hire ushers — at least not in the kind we
remember from our youths, those gangly teen- -age
boys 1n ill- -fitting uniforms who would wander through
the aisles with flashlights.

No, Clark hired a gun toting guard equipped with
an attack dog. The guard and the dog are assigned to
patrol the Jackson Mall Cinema during the showing of
all movies.

“The guard’s name is Josephius Pollock,” Clark
said. “He carries a .357 Magnum. The dog’s name is
Strider. He is a Doberman pinscher. They make a
very effective team.”

Clark said that before he hired the armed guard
and the Doberman, “You couldn’t even hear the mov-
ie. The pe0ple in the audience were shouting and
screaming, they were yelling at the screen and at
each other. On a couple of occasions I went up and
turned the projector off and turned all the lights up. I

clean up. “What did we find ,
on the floor? You name it.‘
Liquor bottles, marijuanaI
joints, condoms.

Now though, Clark said, with Pollock and his attack
dog, things have settled down. “Pe0ple back off when ‘
they see him coming up the aisle. And if they don’t
back off, Josephius puts them in their place and ‘=
throws them out. He’s a big guy. He’s not intimidated
by anything.”

Clark said some members of the audience have
tried to test Pollock and the dog, with no success.
“There’s been a couple of peeple who have gotten in
his face, but none of them have taken a swing at him.
They just want to find out how far they can push him.
Not too far.”

This whole idea — a guard with a .357 Magnum and i
an attack Doberman — seemed so far removed from j
the old concept of movie ushers politely escorting .
arriving patrons to their seats that I decided to talk
with Pollock to see how he felt about his job. ‘

“The theater just got sick of peeple talking and
screaming throughout the movie,” he said. “So they
hired me I’m a bodybuilder. I wear a police-style i
uniform. Verbal abuse, I can handle that. I had to put
one guy in jail. I handcuffed him and took him out of
the theater.”

You carry handcuffs, too?

“Oh, yeah,” Pollock said. “I need all the tools I can
get. A lady told me that if I didn’t have the dog, some
of the peOple in the audience would jump on me. But
no one’s going to fool with that dog.

“People in the audience look at the dog and say to
me, ‘Does he bite?’
“And I say, ‘He has teeth.’

“And they say, ‘Yeah, but he has a muzzle on.’

“And I say, ‘The muzzle comes off with one snap.

.Pollock said more families are coming to the the-
ater now, because they know that he, his gun and his I
dog have made things more orderly. He said the
Jackson Mall Cinema is considerably quieter than it
was before he was hired.

’9,

“I think you’re going to see more and more of this
in movie theaters,” he said. “Put a little fear in
people’s hearts, and they’ll stay in order.”

Pit bull escapes death if ‘owner pays

 

By CHARLIE BRENNAN

Rocky Mountain News Boulder Bureau

 

BOULDER —- Pete the pit bull es-
caped a date with the executioner yes-
terday after his unemployed 18-year-old
owner was forced to represent himself
before one of Boulder’s toughest judges.

Pete, who reportedly has never bitten
anyone, last week was ordered euthan-
ized after he was named in eight run-
ning-at-large complaints and two vi-

 

. Aurora officials studying
animal-control ordinance/22

 

cious- dog complaints since last October.
But District Judge Murray Richtel,
noted for his tough courtroom demean-

or, yesterday stayed the execution pro-

vided that the owner, Corey Herrington,
meets the weekly installments on his

appeal bond.

“As long as the dog is alive, I’ll do
anything,” a grateful Herrington said
after the hearing.

His appearance before Richtel was
anything but easy, however.

The judge ——- angry that Herrington’s
court-appointed student-laWyer from
the University of Denver’s Legal Aid
program had not brought a licensed at-
torney with him ——- ordered the unem-
ployed laborer to represent himself.

Herrington, his long brown hair casw

cading down both sides of his face, qui-
etly read a statement prepared for him
quickly by the student- -lawyer, Donald
Parker.

§

He then told the judge that he lacked-
the $600 to pay the appeal bond set last

”week by Broomfield Municipal Judge

Harold P Eisenhuth, who ordered the
dog’s execution.

Herrington said he was fired from his
job as a house painter in Aurora three
weeks ago after his car broke down, and
had “about $5. ”

He said he’ll resume work Monday

- “busting concrete” for $5 an hour, work-

ing 25 to 40 hours a week.

Richtel agreed to stay the execution
as long as Herrington met a modified
appeal bond, which called for him to pay
$65 by 3:15 pm yesterday, $40 by 6
pm Aug. 7, and $35 by 6 pm each
successive Friday as long as the appeal
is pending

Meanwhile, the dog remains in the
custody of the Boulder County Humane
Society, though Herrington said he
would try to get visitation rights.

“He can come see the dog anytime,
said society director Jan Glick. “I think
it’s best for the owner and best for the
dog.”

Glick said workers at the humane so-
ciety were so confident of the reprieve
that the 14-month-old dog was never
even placed on a death watch.

“He requested a cigarette, and we
gave it to him,” she quipped. “We give
him anything he asks for, ‘cause he’s
that kind of dog.”

‘Broomfield has no prohibitions
against pit bulls, and is not considering
one, said Broomfield police spokesman
Pete Kurronen.

“‘We don’t care that it’s a pit bull,“
Kurronen said. “But, if the animal is
vicious, euthanasia can be the way to go
if it’s a problem in the city. ”-

L.A. Rounds Up Support
to Save the WildHorses

 

It’s a long way from the Ameri-
can West to- West Hollywood—but
when the two did meet, it was
instant chic, sudden awareness and
almost immediate gratification.

All of that—and more—as the
3~month~old Los Angeles chapter
of the Wild Horse Sanctuary held
an overflow luncheon at open-
for-the-occasion Spago on Friday.
It was not an afternoon for easy
eating or leisurely chatting.

Beverly Petal, wearing one of
the money-raising Wild Horse
T-shirts, pulled Barbara Lazaroff
over to a display board with large
color photos of wild horses: “We
don’t have Louis XIV. We don’t
have Queen Elizabeth. This is our
American heritage.”

Petal and Diane Clapp, who, with
husband Jim runs the nonprofit
sanctuary in the Shasta County
community of Shingletown, were
‘ adamant that political action to
f save wild horses is more than
: necessary. If a 90-day regulation,
' proposed by the Bureau of Land
Management in April but still not
implemented, goes into effect, they

said, there would be “unjustifiable
killing of thousands of wild horsi ‘

“es

The proposal inVolves rounding -

up wild horses and killing those
that are not adopted, organizers

said. The event was not just a ;

fundraiser, but an attempt to get

the word out to push public reac- .

tion.
Write to Interior Secretary Don-
ald Hodel, Petal kept telling people.

“They are waiting for public re- ‘:

AURORA —— Wandering Dober-A
mans and amorous poodles could
find themselves in quite a fix un—
der a strict pet ordinance that will
be considered by the city council
withina month.

Animals caught running loose
for a third time would be spayed
or neutered before they are re-
turned to their owners under the
proposal, which was presented to
the council’s code-enforcement
committee earlier this week.

And pet owners would not be
allowed to breed their animals un-
til they first obtained a permit,
paid a fee and passed a test on
responsible pet ownership.

“This is going to be a hot one,”
councilman Steve Bobrick said of
the proposed ordinance. “Pet lov—
ers are going to come out of the
woodwork and say ‘Leave my pet
alone.‘ ”

But the problem of stray dogs
and cats is so severe that stricter
controls are needed, he said.

Animal control officer Tami
Slama said thousands of animals
are euthanized in the city every
year.

“We have to euthanize three
times a week, and that‘s three
times too many,” Slama said.
“There are always puppies and kit:

Animal-control ordinance
* under study in Aurora

tens among those being euthan-
ized.”

Slama said the proposed ordi-
nance would be a start in getting
the animal p0pulation under con-
trol in the city.

But she admitted enforcement
would be a real problem.

“We'd have to rely on snitches,” ’
she said. '

Councilwoman Barbara Loucks,
who chairs the code-enforcement
committee, said she doubts the or-
dinance will get very far this time
ardundi.

A dog owner herself, Loucks

‘said she should be able to breed

«-

her pet without getting a permit.

“I don’t want to see a lot of
puppy farms in the city, but if you
have a pet at home, you should be '
able ts breed it,” she said.

Among the other proposals in
the breeding ordinance are:

I A limit on the number of ani-
mals per household. Currently, a
resident cannot have more than
three dogs, but there is no limit on
cats, fish, birds, hamsters or other
pets.

3 A higher registration fee for
pets that are not spayed or neu-
tered. .

l Increased folloWup on aniwj’jg
mals that are adopted from the }
city shelter, to ensure they are
spayed or neutered 'when they are
old enough. , ,

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - July 27, 1987

' By Edward Iwata

Despite the valiant efforts
of marine mammal experts, Mi.
brick the baby porpoise'died ear-
:ljr yesterday morning in the
ﬁrms of her caretakers at Ma-
rine World/Africa USA in Val-

lejo; : '

€13 Shortly after 1 am, the new-
born Dall’s porpoise began trem-
, ling and stopped breathing as she
. (rated in a small plastic swimming
p901 specially set up for her treat-
5“”ent, said Jim Bonde of Marine
ﬁcrld. ' ‘
12' Veterinarians injected drugs
ihto Miwok to stimulate her respira-
tory system and treat her for shock.
gut the weakened calf, apparently
. parated from her mother before
' e was beached, could not be reviv-
d after surviving six days in captiv-
y.

_‘ “We’ve been with Miwok all
week, and it’s very, very difficult
gotto grow attached,” said Laurie
Gage, a Marine World veterinarian.
“She's an extremely beautiful ani-
mal. it’s sad, but I could just listen to
her breathing all week and tell she
didn’t have a chance of surviving.
We tried our very hardestj’

h Gage performed a necropsy, or
an animal autOpsy, yesterday morn-'
ing. Miwok’s tissues appeared fine,
but her lungs were very congested,
' nd Gage concluded that the sleek
black porpoise died of complica-
tions from pneumonia.

:3 Gage said the immunological

system of the 30pound, three-foot

“porpoise was extremely weak be-

gause she did not have her mother’s

gourishing milk, which provides an-

tibiotics needed to fight off bacter-

ia. ‘ .

.ﬂ

.. The rare porpoise was rescued
Monday night from the rough surf .
”at Miwok Beach, three miles north
33f Bodega Bay. Workers at the Cali-
fornia Marine Mammal Center in

fail’ciarin County rescued her and rush-

 

 

 

at Marine World on Tuesday

ed her to Marine World, where she
was placed in a special tank before
being transferred to the swimming
pool. They named her after the
beach ’where she came ashore.

Her plight was reported nation-
wide, and throughout the week sev-
eral hundred people called Marine

,A

 

World to volunteer their time and

any“ '\

around the clock, standing in the

‘ chilly water of the swimming p001

in four-hour shifts.

The marine mammal specialists
do not know why Miwok beached
herself. She had been alive for no
more than a week, and may have
gotten separated from her herd.
Other theories suggest that the
mother was attacked by predators,
or that the mother rejected her ba-
by for unknown reasons.

“That little thing was looking
for its mother,” said Jim Mullen,
assistant training director at Marine
World. “She knew where the shah
lows were, and she came in with the
tide. Her last thoughts were survivg
al."

At first, Miwok was suspicious
other human handlers, swimming
away in fear. But as the days and
nights passed, the calf became more
trusting, often floating toward the
warmth of their bodies and resting
quietly in their laps.

The marine experts tried to du-
plicate the milk by feeding Miwok
every two hours with mineral-rich
formulas through a large syringe
and tube leading into her stomach.
Some of the formulas were hard for
the porpoise to digest, giving her
diarrhea. Others, including a for-
mula of liquid fat and oil, were easi-
er for her to stomach.

For the Marine World staff, Mi-
wok was among a dozen porpoises,
dolphins, sea lions and other marine

HOUSTON POST - 8/1/87W

’- Cat owner told

to find homes

for 1 1 O felines

WASHINGTON, Pa. (AP) ——
Sam Mancuso’s soft spot for cats
has put him under a magistrate’s
deadline to rid his home of about
110 cats by Aug. 12.

Mancuso, 58, said he hopes cat-
lovers will take them. If not, he will
rely on friends.

“I’ll just- have to impose on
them. I don’t want to see (the cats)
put to sleep,” he said Thursday.

Mancuso said he never liked cats
that much, in» he began giving
them homes eight years ago be-
cause he didn’t like the way others
abused them. ,

Hehoused and fed as many 200
cats this spring, but now he has
about 120. Magistrate J. Albert
Spence, ruling last month, said he
can keep 10 cats.

The city Board'of Health, acting
on neighbors’ complaints, declared
his home unfit for habitation on
May 19 and in July charged him

* with creating a nuisance.

Mancuso, Who was in the hospi-
tal in May, had a son and his friend
feed the cats, but they couldn’t
keep up with cleaning after them.
When Mancuso returned, he said
he had to throw out most of his
furniture, carpeting and clothing.

He said food and litter costs him
about $160 a week and he spends
at least six hours a day caring for
his felines.

“I don’t like thecost, (but) it
wasn’t the cats’ fault,” he said.

The Washington County Hu-
mane Society inspected the house
in June and declared that the cats
were not being abused. .

TAMPA TRIBUNE - 7/30/87

Animal Control
Should Be a Haven

I’ve just finished reading the Tri-
bune’s second article regarding the death
of the Doberman left in an animal con-
trol truck for three days. The dog died a

. horrible death when its internal organs

exploded due to the heat of the truck.

It is too late to help this animal, but I
sincerely hope that there will be some
follow through and that the driver or per-

sons responsible for this incident will get
more than a slap on the wrist. Animal
Control is supposed to be a shelter for
unwanted and stray animals; and though
the job is not a pleasant one, it needs to
be done in a humane manner. Taxpayers
who care about animals should remind
our county commissioners that this shel-
ter is supported with our tax dollars.

I know there are good employees at
Animal Control who are appalled by this
incident. It is my hope that they also will
do what they can to rid the shelter of this
type employee. In other areas animal
control duties are sometimes run by the
local Humane Society; perhaps that
might be a step in the right direction
here. There have been too many allega-
tions of mishandling by Animal Control
employees. Just recently there was an in-
vestigation, and now this. Let’s hope our
county administrator and county com-

‘2 missioners do something this time.

“That really stuck in our craw,” .
Callas said.

Her group pushed for represeno
tation on a subcommittee appoint- '
ed to find another solution, and a

' compromise ordinance was agreed
on last week .

j Instead of changing space re-
quirements, the proposal would
regulate how animals affect their
neighbors. The ordinance, which
goes to the planning commissmn
next month, would prohibit ani-
mals frOm living closer than 30 feet
to a neighboring house and re-
quires stables to be at least 15 feet

from the property line. It also ‘

would give the city more power to

deal with nuisances such as ma-

“This will make our lives much .

easier, too,” said Dougal Graham
of the livestock association. “Most
of theproblems we’ve encountered

are of animals next to a fence or .

The livestock and horseman’s

say the new ordinance may elinu-

Westminster officials, faced with
a livestock complaint every two
weeks, two years ago banned farm
animals in residential areas.

“Before that, it was awful. We
had some people with 50 chickens

in their back yards,” said animal

control supervisor Shelly Hauff.
“There were complaints about
roosters crowing in the middle of
the night and feathers flying every-
where. There wasn’t anything we
could do - it wasn’t illegal to have
feathers flying.” .

The ordinance was controver-
sial, but critics outnumbered pro-
ponents, and city council members
finally decided it was time West-

WILDLIFE

The battle to save endangered oWl species

Scientists encour ed
by rehabilitation o a
short—ear but worried
about disease in young

By Sy Montgomery
Special to the Globe
ANTUCKET - As ospreys
and gulls swirled in the
graying evening skies over-
head. field biologist G.
Randy Tate carefully
placed a white plastic pet carrier be-
tween two bayberry bushes in the field
known as Ram Pasture on Nantucket.
He opened the metal grill door and
stood back. Quietly. he waited.

Five minutes passed. And then, a
crow-sized. yellow-eyed owl hopped out ’
of the carrier. With one leap. it lifted off
on its three-foot wings. ﬂying powerful-
ly about five feet above ground until it
was out of sight. "You’d never guess
that 10 months ago this bird had a
broken bone poking out of its shoul-
der." said Vicky Smythe. field biologist
at Hingham’s New England Wildlife
Center. “.God just look at him ﬂy."

The July 20 release was the first
time in Massachusetts that a short-
eared owl, a severely endangered spe- .
cies in the state. had been successfully
rehabilitated and returned to the wild.
“it's analogous to releasing a California
condor or a whooping crane." said -
Scott Melvin, field director of the Mass—
achusetts Natural Heritage and the en'
dangered species program of the Mass-
achusetts Division of Fisheries and
Wildlife. “The population is so small
out there, every single bird counts."

The owls were once common in
many Massachusetts coastal areas that
now are dotted with summer homes;
there are only 20 breeding pairs left in
the state. about half of them on Nan-
tucket. They are confined to secluded
heaths on Nantucket and on Tucker—
nuck Island. Martha’s Vineyard and
the Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge
along the two islands extending south
of Chatham off Cape Cod. And all but
Monomoy are in the midst of a building
boom.

Now, an unidentified feather dis-
ease, recently discovered in four Nan-
tucket owlets. may further threaten the
owls' survival unless biologists can
identify the disease and stop it.

As they search for the cause of the
disease, biologists are treating the four
owlets at the Hingham center so that
they. like the released adult, might
have a shot at survival in the wild. If
the babies’ feathers grow in properly.
biologists hope to release the owls in
the spring. If they survive the next
year. to maturity. they perhaps will
produce chicks of their own.

The tawny-colored. short-cared owl,
streaked with white and black. is a sort
of poster child for endangered species
in Massachusetts. Sporting short,
brownish ear-like tufts. raised only in

extolling the Non-Game Wildlife Fund
and other state conservation programs.
Although they can be found throughout
the United States. and on every conti-
nent except Australia. short-cared owls
have been on the National Audubon
Society's Blue List of declining species
in the United States and Canada since
1976. Loss of broad, grassy habitat is
thought to be the major factor in their
decline.

The adult male released last month
had been found in Hyannis. The upper
bone of its left wing was protruding
through an ugly shoulder injury. pre-
sumably suffered in a collision with a
power line. The crippled. emaciated
bird first was thought to be a barn owl;
but once it was identified as an endan—
gered short-eared owl, Smythe said.
"we were very surprised and excited."

“it was around Halloween, and with
his ear tufts poking up and those big
eyes. he looked just like a little devil,”
Smythe said. The devilish expression.

itself. this species contracts the
yellow iris of its eyes until only the
black pupils show. .

After its wound was. cleaned
and wrapped by veterinarian and
center director Vaughan Pratt.
the owl was force-fed pureed mice
for a week, until it started eating
dead mice on its own. For a
month. it recuperated. gaining
weight and strength. until Pratt
decided it could withstand sur-
gery. Pratt set the fractured left
wing by inserting a thin steel wire
through the shoulder to join the
two broken ends of the bone. a
technique he had used many
times before to repair wing frac-
tures on the blue jays. starlings.
and red-tailed hawks that are tak-
en to the center from all around
the area. '

“Anyone can do the surgery."
Pratt said in an interview. “but
what made the difference was
that the animal had the space in
which to ﬂy freely for fairly long
distances." The ﬂight therapy. he
said. is being used increasingly in
wildlife rehabilitation centers
around the country. and it it is
particularly important for pred-
ators such as owls. hawks and ea-
gles whose hunting ﬂights must

. carry them over hundreds of

acres.

As X-rays revealed the owl's
bone was healing. the bird was
given progressively larger space in
which to ﬂy: finally it was cruis-
ing in a plant-filled enclosure 150
feet long. 50 feet wide and 25 feet
high.
Wildlife Center staff were pre-
pared to release the bird in June.
when populations of meadow
voles, short-cared owls' favorite
prey were at their summer peak.
Tate would attempt to monitor the
owl. along with the rest of the is-
land's owl population. as part of
his master's thesis in biology at
University of Massachusetts in
Boston.

But shortly: before the sched—
uled release. Tate discovered two
balding 3-week-old, short—cared
owlets in a nest beneath bayberry
and huckleberry bushes on Nan-
tucket. Drawn to the nest by the
birds‘ hissing food-begging calls
(pssssst-SHUH! psssst-SHUHi).
Tate noticed they were missing
feathers and suffering small.
scrape-like injuries that were in-
fested by maggots. “My first im-
pulse was to leave them alone.
and let nature take its course." he
said, “but then you realize the per—
centage of the population this re-
presents. We had to try to help
them."

Removing them from the nest
site also posed a risk. Most young
birds undergo a process known as
imprinting - discovered in the
19605 by Austrian biologist Kon-
rad Lorenz — during which their
species-identity is shaped. If no
adults of their species are around
to serve as role-models during this
critical phase, young birds never

learn to recognize their own spe-
cies.

And so the now-healthy adult
owl became a key player in the
owlets’ rehabilitation. The
planned release was put off, so the
older bird could serve as a father
figure for the youngsters while
they were being treated.

Placed in the large aviary with
the full-grown bird. “the babies
were definitely zeroing in and
looking at the adult." Smythe

7 said. “and the adult. when it ﬂew.

would circle near the babies. and
then perch near them."

The young birds. their heads
swiveling in the 360-degree are
unique to owls. constantly fol-
lowed the movements of the larger
animal. “At the imprinting stage.
they would follow an elephant
around like that if you put one
there.” Smythe said. ”That‘s why
it's so important they had a mem-
ber of their species around."

Things were going well when.
on July 13. Tate found two more
sick baby short-cared owls in
Nantucket nests. Their flight
feathers were missing or mal-
formed. emerging from twisted
shafts engorged with blood and
encrusted. “It began to look more
and more like all four babies were
suffering from the same thing."
Pratt said. The adult's release
again was postponed, and again
he was pressed into service as a
role model for the new arrivals.

Center staff still are trying to
determine the cause of the feather
problem. New York state toxicol-
ogist Ward Stone analyzed feather
samples for toxins. such as pesti-
cides. that could have caused the
malformation. {Massachusetts
does not have a state toxicologist.)
None was identified. Scrapings of

 

 

the tissue surrounding the feather
shafts have been sent to a Mass-
achusetts lab to determine if a
virus or bacteria is responsible.
Those results are not in yet.

”l'm very concerned about
what's going on." Tate said. Last
week he found a feather in a
Tuckernuck nest showing evi-

‘ dence of the same disease. As far
as Pratt and Tate know. the prob-
lem has never been observed in
short-cared owls before — but. they
point out. studies of the species
here only began three years ago.

Melvin. of the Natural Heritage
program. said the ongoing study is
the first to document the owls’
range. food and habits on Nan-
tucket - a first step toward devel-
oping a management plan to pro-
tect the species. Tate has learned
that each pair of short-cared owls
needs 140 acres in which to hunt.
But with a typical one-acre lot on
Nantucket selling for between
$250.000and $400,000. Melvin
said. “as a conservation agency.
we don't have the means to ac-
quire enough land to protect even
one pair."

All but one of the 10 owl breed-
ing territories on Nantucket are
privately owned either in part or
completely. and thus vulnerable
to development. Tate said.

The island's unu'sual collection
of salt-tolerant shrubs and coastal.
grasses represent about half of the
habitat known as moorland in the
Northeast. The lG-square-mile
area is host to a number of rare
plants. and also is home to the
rarest butterﬂy in New England.

lary. At dusk. the island‘s skies
are heavily speckled with hunting
ospreys. harriers, kestrels and
owls. It is a special place.

, “There are plenty of other
areas where people could build
their second or third homes.” Tate
said. “The question is, do people
want to have these birds. or do
they want Nantucket to be like the
rest of the eastern seaboard?“

must take exception to the Aug. 11

article “Reared for research.” There is an
assumption that these animals are going on to
bigger and better things — that is, to benefit
the human race. Having gone through four
years of mediCai sChool, I know only too well
‘ that the majority of medical research I read is
mediocre at best, and is inaccurate, mislead-
ing and Completely unnecessary for the ad-
vancement of medical science at worst.

Thousands of animals die needlessly and in

agony every day in order that students pass
classes. professors get tenure, and research-
ers with grants get paychecks. What is
needed is a system that demands quality, not
quantity, and uses the lowest'form of animal
life possible and ideally none at all. I believe
the human race is smart enough to develop
and use alternative testing methods, such as
tissue cultures and computer models, that do
not require the torture of animal life.

Unreliable testing

PUBLIC HEALTH and safety are jeopar-
dized because researchers, encouraged by the
multi-billion dollar animal supply industry,
are reluctant to break away from old-fashion-
ed, unreliable and costly animal testing meth-
ods. For example: ‘ '

0 Because researchers waited for results
from animal tests, 20 million children’s sleep-
ing garments treated with Tris, a fire retar-
dant, remained on the market 1% years after
modern non-animal methods identified Tris
as a cancer-causing agent.

0 Two billion tax dollars .and 30 years spent
on animal tests show no progress toward a
cure for cancer, nor for any major disease we
know of today. The faCt is that results of tests
on one species cannot be applied accurately to
other species.

0 Fifteen thousand children were born with
severe deformities because thalidomide, a
sedative prescribed for pregnant women, was
found safe after extensive animal testing.E
More sophisticated non-animal tests showed
thalidomide dangerous to the development of
the fetus. Recently, E-Feral and diethyistil-
bestrol have caused serious side effects and
death in humans.

Many alternatives such as highly devel-
oped Computer and mathematical models, cell
and tissue cultures, already exist.

.Life Imprisonment for animals

REGARDING THE article “Reared for
research,” Langshaw’s Farm seems to be
doing a good job of,keeping these animals
clean and disease-free, thus they are good
specimens for research labs. Now, let's talk

compassion. Let’s look at those wire:mesh -

cages, and we can see immediately that these
animals cannot walk in their Cages without
getting their paws stuck in them, and surely
they Cannot rest in them. Another picture
showed a woman cuddling a beagle while
wearing gloves on her hands. thus showing
the dog some affection but because of the
firm’s rules, denying him a human touch.

True, these firms are a step above other
money-making groups, such as the leg-hold
trappers and factory farms using veal crates,

Doomed animals ‘

NORMAN LANGSHAW and Robert Deni-

about their facilities where rabbits and bea-
gles are raised for laboratory research. Beagle
mothers nursing their pups in Clean cages,
caring employes who pet them daily — what
cozy pictures.

So cozy, in fact, that one could almost
forget what is going to happen to those

animals and other animals in laboratories. ‘

Almost. -

In all fairness to the animals and general
public, who should know all the facts, let’s
not forget what research animals’ so-called
duty consists of . It’s a duty they most certain-
ly did not apply for.

All over the country, research animals are

burned by acids or fire for burn research, -
injected with a variety of substances until 50
percent of them die an agonizing death in the '
infamous LD50 test, or maybe given the ‘
choice of electric shock or starvation for
psychological researCh. Obuously, these are =
just a few examples. l -
The sad fact remains thit most of these

tests do not save human lives and are irrele-
vant to human physiology.Moreover, there ,.
are alternatives to using aninals in research. ;

Chicken Snatchers After timber prod- .

ucts, the most important industry in the -
Piney Woods is probably chickens, and
nobody knows more about processmg
them than white-haired inventor Charles .
Bright, 60, of Nacogdoches. Back in 1951
Bright was making a living manufactur-
ing ﬁshing lures and repairing outboard
motors, but times weren’t good. “The
Japanese were cutting into the lure bus1—

ness, and I realized that I needed “a new ‘
product,” he remembered. “Farmers ha ,

Charles Bright’s coops and mechanical chicken catcher promise to cut the handling of poultry to a minimum.

turned most of their land over to timber,
and they were spending most of their time
raising chickens.” So Bright, who had
never raised a chicken, began manufactur-
ing chicken coops of wood.

The enterprise was successful for ﬁf—
teen years, until plastic coops came into
the market. By 1980 Bright had realized
that the time had come to get inventive
again. He built an improved coop, made
of metal and ﬁberglass, whose real virtue
was that it was part of a whole system—7
which Bright also designed—"that helped
automate jobs at processing plants. Today
more than half of the nation’s processing
plants buy their coops from Charles
Bright.

Bright’s current project is aimed at
alleviating labor procurement woes in a
troubled phase of the henhouse—to-table
process known as chicken catching. One
night I went with Bright and chicken haul-
er Paul H. “Pete” Smith of Nacogdoche‘s
to watch one of Smith’s crews in action
at henhouses near Center, not far from
the Louisiana line. We found the crew
as it was unloading its Bright-modiﬁed
forklift from a ﬂatbed truck near a row
of screened broiler houses, with some
six thousand chickens nestled wing to
wing in each.

The crewmen shooed the chickens to
one side, then scooped up birds by the
handfuls, ﬁve in one hand, six "in the
other, and tossed them into the coops.
When the coops were ﬁlled, the forklift
carried them out to a ﬂatbed truck. The

birds chirped nary a protest, and at seven
weeks, two days old—the age of doom for
many a commercial chicken—they were
too fat to scurry away.

' The work was hot, smelly, and, because
chicken catchers are paid by the haul, hur—
ried. Chicken catching is usually night-
time work, and though the pay isn’t bad—
men on a fast crew can earn $300 weekly
—the only advancement available is from
catcher to forklift operator.

The crew I saw was made up of blacks,
but according to Bright and -Smith, Mex-
ican migrants constitute a great part of the
chicken—catching work force. Because the
nation’s new immigration policy has made
hiring undocumented aliens a crime,
fewer Mexicans are crossing the Rio
Grande and employers are seeking an
alternative labor source. That’s where
Charles Bright comes in.

In the garage of a former service station
in Nacogdoches, Bright and his salaried
co-tinkerer, Bernard Livingston, are con-
cocting a chicken-catching machine. It’s a
long, low—slung behemoth that crawls on
metal tracks, like a tank. At its front end
is a row of rubber-coated steel ﬁngers,
which, the inventors tell me, will pick up
chickens and raise them onto one of the
contraption’s conveyer belts. The belts
and various shunts will line the chickens
up in single ﬁle, march them into a Bright
coop, close its doors, and present the met-
al box for forklift removal.

The prototype I saw, still in the

welding—and—wiring stage, reminded me.

Jet Fuel Spill
Suspected of
Sailing Ducks
Potomac Mallards
Coated With Oil

By Lee Hockstader

Washington Post Staff Writer

 

 

It wasn’t long after James Barn-
hard turned up his first duck—reek-
ing of fuel, its plumage matted—that
he became suspicious.

That was Friday. By yesterday.

Bamhard and others scouring the
banks of the Potomac River near
Fort McNair in Southwest Wash-
ington had found dozens of other
mallards in similar condition.

The water near the Fort McNair
Yacht Basin where Barnhard lives is
pungent with oil and ﬁlmed with a
fine blue-green sheen. Traces of the
:sheen have been spotted from south
of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge'to the
Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge
on the Anacostia River, according to
boat pilots who ply the river.

For Barnhard, a former Navy air-
plane mechanic who. now repairs
marine engines, all the clues point-

ed in the same direction: a Delta Air '

Lines 727 that lost power after tak-
ing off from National Airport Wed-
nesday dumped three tons of fuel
and returned to the airport five
minutes later. '

The source of the pollution re-
mains a mystery, but Coast Guard
ofﬁcials have begun efforts to de-
termine its source. Yesterday, tech-
nicians from the service’s Marine

Delta officials have described the ,
incident, involving Flight 415 to
Dallas-Fort Worth, as routine. Yes-
terday they insisted that the fuel

"was jettisoned west of the river,

perhaps over Alexandria. In any
event, they said, a 10- to 12-knot
wind was blowing from the south- 3
east and the fuel would have turned
to vapor before falling the 1,500 to 32

“It is virtually impossible that any of

the fuel jettisoned by the Delta ﬂight
could possibly have reached the Po-
tomac River,” said Dick Jones, a Delta
spokesman in Atlanta. “I’m sorry for
the ducks. I just don’t think that we
were guilty.”

But some witnesses who watched
Ethe ﬂight of the Delta airliner took
issue with the official version.- Ste-
phen D. Danzig, who at the time of
the flight was aboard the Cherry
Blossom, an Alexandria charter
boat, said he saw the airplane dump
its fuel directly over the Potomac.

Danzig, a captain in the Fairfax

County Police Department in
Charge of the special operatiops di-
vision, gave this account in an in-
terview yesterday: “Shortly after 6
'p.m., I glanced up at the aircraft
and saw liquid spewing from both
wings . . . . When I first noticed it,
it was directly over the river” next
to Old Town Alexandria. Danzig
added that he did not smell the fuel,
or see or hear it hit the river.
_ The captain of the Cherry Blos-
som, Clayton F. Cisar, president of
the Potomac River Pilots Associ-
ation, described the spill as “the
Worst slick I’ve seen.” He added:
“And I’ve been a ship captain for
years and years and I’ve seen some
pretty bad spills.”

As for the ducks, rescue workers
said they seemed disoriented, less
buoyant than usual, their feathers
stripped of their natural oils.

1 “They walk up on shore badly ir-
ritated,” said Barnard, who has
been. cleaning the birds with a Hu-
mane Society-approved solution of
Dawn dishwashing liquid and warm
water. “When they come out of the
water you know there’s a problem:
The water is irritating them and
they’re sinking.” '

ing to clean up the ducks and the
river. The Humane Society and the

ooxs——m£ WASHINGTON POST

Some witnesses say these ducks are victims of an airliner fuel spill.

ern Virginia were in the act by yes-
terday, farming the mallards out to
a coterie of volunteers specially
trained to treat fuel-damaged birds.

One volunteer, Bill Taylor of Ar-
lington, said he spent several hours
Saturday and yesterday on the river
trying to catch the mallards so he
could treat them. Many, he said,
were barely afloat, with only their
heads visible above the water. He
saw one drown, and heard of others.

“We have six of them here at my
place,” Taylor said. “They’re cov-
ered with oil. They’re not lifeless,
but they’re weakened.” Taylor ad-
vised boaters to take sick mallards

to the Arlington County Animal
Shelter for care.

Humane Society ofﬁcials and oth-
er volunteers said that unlike spills
of heavy, unrefined oil that goops
onto birds’ feathers, the fuel in the
Potomac appears highly refined and
tends to be absorbed into the ducks’
skin, perhaps poisoning their vital
organs.

Volunteers say cleaning the birds
and rehabilitating them can take
days. Many are dehydrated , and
must be force-fed a special concoc-
tion of fluids, which may include Ga-
torade.

How many lawyers put
their lives on the line

to protect a client? Not
many, right? Well, Mad-
eline Bernstein, Senior
Legal Counsel and Vice-
President for Humane
Law Enforcement for the
American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, does just that
every time she leads a
raid on ,a dog or a cock
fight. in addition to a
cadre of cops and ASPCA
agents and several
trained attack dogs, the ._
scene may include 50 or -

60 excitable and possibly armed specta-

tors—a situation that could easily ex-
plode with one false move.

“My clients, the animals of New York
State, are totally defenseless and have
no way of speaking for themselves,” says
Bernstein. “It’s my job to see that their
legal rights are enforced and that there
are laws on the books to protect them.”
In the first year that Bernstein was with
the ASPCA she raised the number of
animals taken into protective custody
by 142 percent. In 1984, the year before
Bernstein took the job, only one person
was arrested on an animal-cruelty
. charge (which ranges from willful tor-
ture to practicing veterinary medicine
without a license). In 1985, 78 people
were arrested.

Prior to joining the ASPCA, Madeline’s
experience with animals and their rights
was limited to ownership of Scara-
mouche, a short-haired domestic alley
cat. On the job, Bernstein quickly
learned that, while there are laws pro-
tecting animals from being cruelly
maimed, injured, unjustifiably killed or
neglected, animals are also entitled to
wholesome air, and many of these laws
are seldom enforced. “Obviously the
police have their hands full trying to
catch people who are hurting other
people, " she says, “so their first priority
is not going to be busting a pet shop
that’s selling sick poodles.”

To crack down on abuses, Bernstein
revitalized the unit within the ASPCA

This lawyer pounoes

that is legally allowed to carry guns and
make arrests relating to crimes against
animals. Acting on their own surveil-
lance work and on tips phoned in by
concerned citizens and a network of
carefully developed informers, these
agents work with Madeline to find cock-
and dog-fight promoters, pet-shop own-
ers whose animals live under inhumane
conditions and private citizens who are
abusing animals.

 

In her first year on the job, Bernstein
spearheaded an ASPCA drive to stop
the owners and drivers of the lovely
carriage horses in Manhattan’s Central
Park from overworking and neglecting
the animals. Established laws limit the
number of hours the horses can work
and specify other provisions for their
care, but it was not until Bernstein and
her agents handed out tickets for a
variety of violations on 1,557 separate
occasions that the owners cleaned up
their act. Not content to rest on their
laurels, Bernstein and the ASPCA have
been lobbying the New York City Coun-
cil to limit the hours in certain areas to

avoid the danger of
heavy traffic—under her
. plan, when owners and
drivers break the law,
they would be required
to attend a class on
horse care and driving.

' " Bernstein’s willing-
ness to go to the scene of
the crime, be it a circus,
a kennel or a city park,
has been hazardous to
her clothes. Her dress-
for-success suits are of-
ten covered with muddy
paw prints, horse hair

_ and cock feathers. But

; it’s all in a day’s work for
this determined woman who started her
career and honed her legal and prose-
cuting skills as an assistant DA in the
Bronx District Attorney’s office.

One of Bernstein’s most gratifying
accomplishments since joining the
ASPCA has been alleviating the horren-
dous situation many animals faced upon
arriving at New York City's airports.
Dogs, cats and other animals bound for
pet shops in the area were flown into
New York City and then forced to wait in
their cages, sometimes for days at a time
without food or, Water, until someone
from the shop got around to picking
them up. “After I told the airlines that
they were equally responsible under the
law for the welfare of those animals, the
airlines began calling me as soon as the
legal holding period expired.”

To involve the police, the courts and
citizens in her cause, Madeline Bern-
stein has had to become a bit of a pest.
“At first the cops didn’t'want to hear
from me,” she says, “but after a few
busts at which they saw such abuses as a
kitten that had been scalded repeatedly
by its owner, they’ve been more willing
to help.” And she’s keeping the pressure
on. “Sometimes I feel like the Equalizer,”
says this lawyer/sleuth, who, off hours,
shares a home in Manhattan with her
husband (and Scaramouche). “People
are stronger and smarter than most
animals, but our work at the ASPCA
helps to tip the scales so the animals get
a chance to have a decent life.” I

Not a bad life for a dog. a ., -
Moose is a 2-year-old black Labrador trained
to'help his handicapped owner become more

independent. He is companion to Peggy. Thomas, .

an Arizona State University law student
confined to a wheelchair after a car accident left
her with a spinal cord injury.

On an ordinary day, Moose attends law school,
pulls texts from shelves, picks up dropped
pencils, turns off light switches and performs any
of 40 other specialized tasks.

Arizona has three other service dogs like . j

5 Moose, a small number that is expectedto

 

an...

 

 

increase as more people learn about the program.

Thomas and Moose became a pair last
February. Before they met, Thomas was “a very

frustrated person going around in a wheelchair.” .
A small mishap — such as dropping her purse

at a drive-in window —- would put her in a bad
mend for hours. She felt dependent because she
had to ask for help with even the smallest tasks.

But since Moose became her shadow, “I no
longer feel I’m a spectacle,” she says. “People
always notice Moose before they notice my

wheelchair, and we immediately have something ,

in common.” -

Moose is an offspring of Canine Companions f

for Independence, a Santa Rosa, Calif.,
organization that trains dogs to aid the
physically challenged.

l
l
When Thomas learned about the innovative ”J

program, she applied to receive a service dog and“:

i was accepted.

. She then attended a two-week class designed '
. to match dogs With potential owners and teach
the pair how to work with one another. '

u ' ' '
It was a not,” she recalls, remembering a

room with 12 potential dog owners and 10 dogs. ' ’
parading in a Circle. “At first, I was sure I would . .

never be able to control a dog.”

‘ That’s because, initially, the dogs were ‘
accustomed to their tramers’ voices and, “none
of thsz‘rrn '-.t.tt>nld listen to e “"3 I Mid.”

 

Eventually . Thomas and the trainers realized“?

' Moose was her match because he is a good

retriever and the right size to perform tasks she

needs help with. . ,

Matching dogs with the disabled is no easy

'chore. Canine Companions for Independence

even performs psychological evaluations on dogs t
and their potential owners.
7 Thomas says Moose was found to be good for
her emotionally because he is even-tempered, a
trait helpful to someone experiencing the stress I
of law school. ’. e . *
‘f‘Moose is very smart and calm in tense

situations.” Thomas sayerereally has the I it
_ ability to mellow me out when I’m frustrate d.” g 7

It took time for her to iearn to work with
, Moose, but now she couldn’t surviVe without ‘

1 him, she says.

- Each morning, she tells her dog to don his
backpack, and this signals to him the start of a
new working day. . ‘ ‘

When Thomas is not attending cIaSSes, Moose
wears a small pack that contains her personal
items and his water dish. ‘

When school is in session, he wears a larger
pack to help her carry the many books required
, of a law student.

Both packs contain his identification as a '
licensed service dog.

This allows him to accompany Thomas to the
same places a seeing-eye dog would be allowed.
Moose helps her in grocery stores, restaurants
and bars, movies and church.

When she goes to the bank, he stands on his
hind legs to make her transactions at the counter-
she cannot reach from her wheelchair; ' ‘

Thomas Often s aster ifshefesls any for

Absolutely not.

» “Moose’s life is much more complete than that:
of a common house pet,” she says. “When he has 3
his pack on, he prances around like a king. His
Job makes him feel very important.”

, ‘ Sharing her life with Moose makes Thomas
feel important too. ~

“When. I got him, i felt I had adopted a child,” i

David and Janet Hooper left the

 

Fairfax County Animal Shelter yes-

terday morning as quickly as they

came in. But they were shaken,

.teary-eyed and .minus their two
aged, leukemic cats.

It was a trip the Centreville couple

dreaded but one they decided they

had to make. The Hoopers asked the
shelter staff to end the lives of Bert

j and B.D., which stands for Boda?

cious. One cat was “down to the

'bones with‘cancer,” both were too

__weak to eat, David Hooper said.

“Oh geez, don’t look back,” Hoop-

géﬂﬁ ,33~year-old musician, told his '

gulping wife as they left the shelter,
struggling with 13 years of mem-
ories of the cats, one a tabby and
the other black and white.

“We’re trying to be optimistic,”
said Janet Hooper, an obstetrics
nurse at Fairfax Hospital. “When
you think about it, we had a‘ lot of
years, but it’s hard. It’s like if some-
body loses a baby. You have to
grieve for what you’ve lost.”

So began a day at the busy Fair-

‘fax animal shelter, which, like doz-

ens of others throughout the Wash-
ington area, serves as a clearing-
house for human emotions as well
as homeless dogs, cats, geese, rac-
coons and more exotic species, in‘

cluding an occasional alligator or
kinkajou, a cousin to the wolverine.

The staff and volunteers at the
shelter are kept busy answering the
phones—which seem to ring Icon-
stantly—caring for animals, sooth-
ing owners who come to leave a pet
and sharing in the’ joy of those who
arrive empty-handed and leave with
an addition to their family.

“I think I use a little more com-
mon sense when it comes to ani-
mals than regular people,” said Lil-
lie Phillips, a clerk at the shelter,
who owns a 3V2-foot-long python, a

talking parrot, a dog and a cat.

Last month, the Fairfax shelter
took in 292 stray dogs, and 137
Cats, and found homes for 129 dogs
and 146 cats, officials said.

“We have files full of cats,” said
Helen Allen, a supervisor at the
”’est 0x Road shelter. “It’ 3 very
hard to match them.” But when
they do, shelter workers say, few

things are more satisfying.

At the Animal Welfare League ,

Shelter in Arlington yesterday,
where soothing music is piped into
rooms filled with cages and donated
blankets and toys for the animals,
Elliott Diamond and his wife, Maria,
came across a year-old dog named
Wicca.

The Diamonds, who live in Res-
ton, were looking for a companion
for their Doberman. They said they
would brin their dog 1n for a com-
patibility test with Wicca. '

“We definitely want it, ” Diamond,
an electronics engineer, said of the
.mixed- breed dog. “It’ s up to our dog
now.’

Saturday's are some of the busiest
times at the shelters, as families
come to look for new pets and staff
members field numerous phone
calls.

One caller to the Arlington shel—
ter, located on Arlington Mill Drive,
wanted to know if there was a dog
that answered to the name of
Rambo. A boy called to ask if the
staff had seen his dog, which he des .,
scribed as black and green.

By B. DVHUMMOND AYRES Jr. 1‘
Special to The New York Times I

SOUTH CHESAPEAKE CITY, Md.
— Using the benefits of a natural geo—‘
graphic barrier and an aggressive pro:
gram of immunization, wildlife special-f
ists here on the Delmarva Peninsula in
eastern Maryland are making a stand ‘
against a rabies epidemic among rac-i '
, coons and other wild animals. i

The specialists hope that by trapping
and immunizing enough raccoons, now
the main carriers of the disease, they
can set up a barrier to keep the epii
demic out of this 20-mile-wide slice of
land between the Chesapeake Bay and
the Atlantic Ocean, even if a rabid anif
mal enters the peninsula, also known
as the Eastern Shore. *

t

The spread of rabies first became

 

‘tion barrier. At least one rabid raccoon

 

apparent in the mid—Atlantic region in .

the early 1980’s, when rabid raccoons

and other animals began showing up r

with increasing frequency along the
mountainous Virginia-West Virginia

border. In the previous decade the re- ’

gion was mostly free of rabies, except
for some cases among bats.

Biologists believe that Appalachian ~

trappers had tried to restock the hol-
lows and hills with raccoons from
Georgia and that at least one of the im-
ported animals was infected with
rabies. i

' lnexorable Creep of the Disease

Today the rabies epidemic is spread-
ing northeastward through the mid-At-
lantic states, with the front sometimes
moving 25 miles or more each year.
Parts of West Virginia, Virginia, Mary-

land and Pennsylvania are affected, as _

well as Washington, and biologists say

they are helpless to stop the disease, i
except here on the Delmarva Peninsu— .

la.

If the plan is successful, biologists
here say, the Eastern Shore wildlife
population will continue to thrive,
farmers and pet owners will not be bur-
dened with costly quarantine proce-
dures for cattle and dogs exposed to

rabid animals, and residents will not ‘

have to worry about the serious medi-

cal treatment that follows human expo- »

sure.

The biologists believe the ZOO-mile-i

long, mostly rural peninsula, made upi
of parts of Delaware, Maryland andi
Virginia, offers an unusual geographic

opportunity for rabies control through

‘ natural and man-made barriers. The,
. peninsula is bounded on the west by thej
Chesapeake Bay and on the east by the?-
5 Atlantic Ocean and the Delaware Bay.-?
’ Even more to the point, the SOD-foot-

wide Chesapeake and Delaware Canal

offers a barrier that runs the entire 20.,

miles across the top of the peninsula.

“We’re goin‘g'to set up a special de-
fense line and try to stop the epidemic
at the canal,” said Nathan Garner, a
wildlife biologist who is running the
project for the Maryland Department
of Health and Mental Hygiene. “First,

kit-vb : u .x:»-:'.,-‘.. 9;“ 3,! 5.1.1:,» : .

raga-«Namatwmm‘

 

we’re hoping the canal will be a barrier
to a lot of sick animals. Next, we’re
going to set up an immunization barri-
er. Then we’re going to pray for the
best.” _ .
The immunization barrier is the

first five miles directly south of the .
canal ‘

“Our hope is that when the first rabid
coon makes it across the canal, he
won’t be able to find another coon that.
hasn’t had an anti-rabies injection,”
Mr. Garner said. “He’ll only have a few

 

'. weeks to live, at best, and so maybe

': time will then be on our side. It’s a
gamble. No one knows for certain if the
plan will work. No one has ever .tried 1

- this before.” =

. . 3
But this much is certain: There 15.not %
much time left to set up the immuniza-

has already shown up less than 10
miles north of the canal, and at the rate
the epidemic has been moving in the
past, it will be only a few more months
before the first rabid raccoon shows up
on the banks of the canal.

“We’ve got to move fast,” Mr. Gar-

ner said. ‘ .
Already he has hired 20 professmnal ;

The hope is to
immunize ,
enough raccoons

 

 

, to stop the spread

of an epidemic.

 

trappers and 10 immunization techni— ,1
cians to go after the 5,000 to 12,000 rac- .
coons he estimates are living in the
strip south of the canal. They have been fr
at work for about two weeks and have
thus far brought in about 500 raccoons '
tn the two immunization stations Mr. ~
Garner has established, one here on the
edge of South Chesapeake City, the 2
other about 10 miles to the east at St. '-
Georges, Del. 3‘

150 Animals a Day.

Ultimately, Mr. Garner plans to have -
two dozen trappers at work, each set-
ting 70 traps over about 3,000 acres. He
thinks they could bring in as many as
150 raccoons a day. .

7 The project, financed mainly by the
state of Maryland, has a budget of
$270,000. Mr. Garner estimates that~ by
the end of October, four of every five
raccoons in the 64,000 acres of the bar-

. rier strip will be immunized.

. “Hopefully:” he said, “any rabid
coon making it intothe barrier strip at
that point will have a hard time finding
that fifth coon before he dies!” ‘

Although the trapping effort will stop
at the end of October, Mr. Garner ex-
pects the rabies fight on the Delmarva

,Peninsula to continue. Noting that im-

munized animals do not transfer their
resistance to their offspring, he said
another round of trapping and immuni-
zation would be necessary in 1988 to’
maintain the disease barrier.

“But with any luck we won’t have to f?
trap and inject indefinitely,” he said- 5
“Work is well under way on developing
an oral vaccine for rabies and it may '
be available in another year or so. We .
could put that in bait and then seed the

 

 

most important element of the plan. To
establish it, Mr. Garner is trying to

Three weeks ago, Jesse White conducted an autOpsy

Florida coast.

Though there were few clues, he determined the
victim died after being wounded by a high-speed boat
that swiftly skipped along the Gulf of Mexico near Sies-
ta Key in Sarasota, Fla.

he has healed and protected hundreds of manatees that

Staff Writer

 

A Stone Mountain man was fined $560 Tuesday.
in connection with his pit bull terrier’ 3 attack on 7151- 9 - '

year-old neighbor Mary Merlino.

DeKalb County Recorders Court Judge J. E. Klrk-I 1. .
land found Hubert 0’ Berry guilty of three violations " '
of the county’ 8 animal control ordinance, not guilty

of two violations and dismissed a sixth charge. The
case marked the first prosecution under DeKalb’s
strengthened vicious animal ordinance, enacted after
a 4 year-old boy was attacked and killed by three pit
bulls last year.

Mrs. Merlino, still visibly weak from her inju-
ries, declined to talk about the ease. But her son,

Tom Merlino, said the pit bull attack July 15 “was

the most horrible experience of her life.”

Mrs. Merlino plans to sue O’Berry for damages. '
- She still is receiving medical treatment at a cost so»

far of about $11, 000, her son said. She required

about 100 stitches for injuries on the legs, throat and .
torso and was hospitalized for about three weeks, ,

she said.
Mrs. Merlino testified that she had gone to her

'1 mailbox, at 5040 Antebellum Drive, to check the

mail and noticed 0’ Berry’s pit bull in front of shrubs

: surrounding the mailbox.

“I merely turned around slowly,” she testified,

The ordeal lasted about 45 min-

time, the pit bull dragged her
toward the garage of her house and
“grabbed hold of. my neck,” she tes-
tified.

Mrs. Merlino managed to grab a
pitchfork to fend off the dog and
make her way to her car, where she
sat for roughly 20 minutes while the
dog stood in the garage.

Realizing she needed medical
attention, Mrs. Merlino left the car
to call for help. “Immediately as I
came around, he lunged at me,” she
testified. “I inched my way to the
door [of the heuse] and got in the

, door.”

0’ Berry testified that his pit
bull terrier, named Railroad and

The chain was secured with a .

padlock. so that Railroad could not
be removed from the chain without

use of a key. But the day of the at»
tack, Railroad snapped a “swivel’_.’3

on the chain, 0’ Berry said.

O’Berry was fined $20 for not,

having Railroad inoculated for ra-

a dangerous animal, and a charge
that O’Berry violated that provision
of the ordinance was dropped.

Railroad died at the county’s an-

death was not revealed during the

red squirrels living atop Mount Graham could face

August 15,1987

Telescope no added risk to rare squirrels “

By Victor Dricks
The Phoenix Gazette .

A new study by the U. S. F01 est Service shows that
construction of a small-scale astrophysical complex
atop Mount Graham would not impose additional risk
to the survival of native red squirrels. .

According to the study, the 280 red squirrels that

‘ live at0p Mount Graham face a 26 percent chance of

extinction over the next three decades —— regardless of
whether astronomers build a telescope complex there.

Peter Stritmatter, director of the University of.

Arizona’s Steward Observatory, said in Phoenix
Friday that the new study was good news for
astronomers.

Federal ofﬁcials said they are not sure how the
study would affect their decision, expected later this
month, on whether to lease land atop the 10,720—foot
peak for astronomical development.

Paul Pierce, director of the Coalition for the,

Preservation of , Mount Graham, a Tucson-based
umbrella organization for 32 environmental" groups,
could not be reached for comment.

The red squirrels, central players in a protracted

battle between astronomers and environmentalists,
live atop Mount Graham 1n southeastern Arizona ~—
and nowhere else 1n the world.

Earlier studies estimated that construction of a

. small-scale observatory would increase the squirrels’
-chances, of- ext.i.11ctio.n.lair..15~ percent -— from 20

W

construction atop the peak next
summer, if arrange ments can be
. worked out with federal ofﬁcials.

He said the 10—meter sub-milli-

percent to 35 percent. The odds the species would be

wiped out would increase to 40 percent if a full-scale
development with up to a dozen telescopes were '

allowed, those studies showed.

The University of Arizona originally proposed
building. up to 13 telescopes on 29 acres atop the
mountain, but in October, the Forest Service

recommended that only four telescopes be allowed on f

a 7-acre site.

Forest Service ofﬁcials said development of a
full-scale observatory would place an unacceptable
risk on the squirrel population, even though,
astronomers have promised to have a biologist;
monitor the animals. . _

“We see no problem,” Stritmatter, who also chairs
the university’s department of astronomy, told 5.

. members of the Phoenix Rotary Club“Friday..

Astronomers want to build an astrophysical
complex atop Mount Graham because it has good;
weather conditions, high altitude, low humidity, and ‘
low light pollution, conditions that make it ideal for:
optical observation. I

“The wildlife biologists have

of dealing with pit bullterriers

By Kara Kunkel

 

OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

As reports of attacks by pit bullterriers and
requests for laws to regulate their ownership
escalate, people discussing the issue tend to be
divided into two camps: those who staunchly
defend the dogs and those who view the ani-
mals as a menace to society.

The two points of View about nearly even in
a Dallas Times Herald Sound-Off telephone
survey during the weekend -—— 1,643 callers, 'or
49.9 percent, said the dogs shouldbe banned,
while 1,650 said such a move would be unfair
and discriminatory. . ' 5

The Sound-Off poll is not scientiﬁc but
serves as an informal measure of the'intensity
of feeling on an issue. ' '

' Typifying the group favoring a ban on pit:
bulls is Odell Simmonsof Lewisville: “They’re

- too mean ,a' dog; they’re vicious. They should
run them out of the country.”
,Other people, many of whom own pit bulls,

. agreed with Toni Gossett of Dallas, who said, “I

simply believe that you can take any animal
and train it to be a killer.”

Discussions about banning pit bulls, because
of their tendency to inflict severe injury when
they bite people or other animals, have become
common at city council meetings throughout
the nation in the past year. The Humane Soci—
ety of the United States says pit bulls were
responsible. for all ﬁve deaths caused by dogs
in the United States during the ﬁrst six months
of this year. - '

Council meetings in suburbs surrounding
Dallas —- including Richardson, Addison and

' Farmers Branch —— have been the scene of
heated debates that sometimes pit neighbor ,
. against neighbor. i

bulls he keeps conﬁned in a‘ fenced yard, “said

Pit bull dogs frighten us, and
they should. They attack other
dogs, they attack small children.
They kill and they maim.

I don’t know if pit bulls are
that ferocious by nature or if
their owners train them to be
aggressive, for the purpose of
protection or ﬁghting in the pit
for the pleasure of a group of
sickies. ’

Then, we come to Black Labs.

I have one. He nearly chewed
my house to its foundation when
he was a puppy, but I’ve never
known a more loving and loyal

He is constantly by my side,
especially if I happen to be

eating. He sleeps at the foot of

my bed and always lets me know,
with a barrage of loud barks, at
six in the morning, that the
garbage man has arrived on

time. He wouldn’t hurt anything .

. but an old shoe.

But this isn’t about my Lab.
This is about my friend’s, a male
named Deuce. I should begin by
telling you that Deuce is a lover.

"We don’t have any idea how
many puppies he has fathered
over the years,” said my friend,
"but it may be reaching three

ﬁgures.” The wife in this .in-
stance has considered having
Deuce’slover days ended, but the '
husband holds out.

"I just couldn’t do that to old
Deuce,” he said. “He’s got a
reputation to uphold.” ' ‘

There’s this man across town
who happens to be a collector for
ghelIRS and he has a female pit

u . -

When his pit bull got into the
mood recently, the man locked
his dog inside a fence, ﬁguring
male dogs couldn’t get over the
fence -- and what male dog in
his right mind would go after a
female pit bull in the ﬁrst place.

Although my friend lives sev-

' eral miles from the man with the

pit bull, old Deuce came calling. .

The male of any species will go
to unusual lengths to satisfy
nature’s beckoning. Deuce, unaf-
raid, despite the many recent
reports of pit bull attacks, scaled
a 6-foot-high fence and had his
way with the pit bull.

My friends got a call from the
pit bull’s owner. He was quite

angry. . .
"I told the man,” the husband
explained, "that as mean as pit

bulls are, if she hadn’t wanted
Deuce as a lover, she certainly

would have let him know.”

what you can get when you cross

BREED BECOMES TARGET OF HYSTERIA

life is the pits for pit bulls

I Are Americans turning the pit bull into a scapegoat? Re-
cent events across the land pose the issue. In Kansas City, an
apparently gentle terrier had to be destroyed after vandals set
its doghouse aﬁre, severely burning the animal. In Greens-
boro, N.C., two pit bulls were clubbed to death and a third
poisoned while chained in a back yard, In
San Antonio, a disc jockey suggested feeding
pit bulls poisoned meat.

“Every pit bull or dog mistaken for a pit
bull is in danger,” says Kathy Bauch of the
Humane Society of the US. In Chicago, two
boxers frolicking in Lincoln Park panicked a
crowd. “The people ran, screaming, ‘Pit
bulls! Pit bulls!’ ” relates Bauch.

The hysteria has been fueled by a spate of
news stories about pit bulls maiming or kill-
ing people, including an April 20 story in
US. News and recent programs on the Phil
Donahue show and ABC’s “Nightline.”

More than 50 communities have banned or
7 restricted the breed, and scores more are con-
sidering such legislation. Some insurance
companies are denying liability coverage to

pit-bull owners. Animal shelters across the country report
unprecedented numbers of pit bulls being turned in by own—
ers for euthanasia. In Des Moines alone, the animal shelter
has destroyed 50 to 100 pit bulls in the past six months.
The dogs’ owners also have been attacked. A Des Moines
woman moved out of her home because of harassment after
she spoke at a city-council meeting in defense of pit bulls.
People threw eggs at her car and garage, scattered broken
glass in her yard and put dog excrement in her mailbox.

The Humane Society favors stricter laws that allow au-
thorities to take action before a vicious dog,
regardless of breed, attacks someone. Mean-
while, dog owners are being held accountable,
charged in some cases with manslaughter.
True, of 13 fatal dog attacks in the US. last
year, pit bulls were involved in seven. In the
ﬁrst half of 1987, the six people who died from
dog bites were all pit-bull victims. And pit
bulls are favored by dog—fight enthusiasts,
drug dealers and other macho types. Yet a
case can be made that people have become a
bit unhinged on the issue. “The tragic thing,”
says Randy Lockwood, a Humane Society ex-
pert on vicious dogs, “is that not all of these
dogs are dangerous. It’s not as if every pit bull
is a little time bomb waiting to go off.” I

Director William Penn Mott’s support for

a wolf reintroduction plan for Yellowstone
National Bark, said Thursday he will do

. everything possible to prevent the plan

from being put into effect. ' .

' ' For years conservationists and environ-

‘ lowstonei-arguing that the carnivores are
_ the “missing link” absent from the park’s

' ecosystem: _v

Earlier this summer the US. Fish and

'Wildlife Service adopted a reintroduction

‘plan that would guide the species’ return

'. to Yellowstone.

Mott said this week that while he under-

‘ stands "Wy'oming’s congressional delega-

tion opposes the reintroduction, he favors

Introducing wolves “would add a great
deal to the natural values and balance the

to be a very exciting

action in Yelioustone ‘

ments, sent a letter to Interior Secretory
Donald Hodel complaining about Mott’s
stance and stating that he doesn’t trust the
department when it comes to the reintrod-
uction plan. .

“One of the thin" that galls me most
about this issue is “at most of the pres-
sure for putting wolves in the park is com-
ing from employees of the Park Service
and Fish and Wildlife Service,” Cheney
wrote. “I just want you to know, Don, that
I am every bit as committed to preventing
government introduction of wolves in Yel-
lowstone as Bill Mott is determined to put 1
them there. * ' '

“If he wants to fight, I’m ready.”

The congressman long has opposed the
reintroduction plan. He fears that the
boundaries for the proposed reintroduction
would expand beyond Yellowstone’s -
boundaries as the wolves roam, that con-
trol guidelines allowing ranchers to kill 3,.
wolves on their property would not work,
and that the wolf remtroduction program
would endanger efforts to boost the park’s
grizzly bear population.

“I’ don’t know how to make myself any
clearer on wolf recovery,” said Cheney. “1

TAMPA -- How do carrier pi-

By air mail, of course.

Postmaster Fidel Linares of the
own ’N Country post office got a
lrprise earlier this week when he
pened up a lively package and —-
oila. out popped four plump pi-
eons. '

“We’ve been baby-sitting,” joked
ostal clerk Kay Reynolds. “They’re
rill babies.”

. Linares said a man in Utah sent
1e gray, tan and white pigeons to a ,
riend in Tampa on Wednesday, but
he sender apparently forgot to tell '
rim when they would arrive. The
Tampa man is away on vacation,
which leaves postal workers stuck
vith some air mail that won’t quit
lying.

“We’ve been feeding them, wa-
Lering them and taking care 'of
:hem," Reynolds said. “They’re do-
mg‘fine. Several people in the office
have birds, so we brought them
some bird seeds.” Postal workers
wasted no‘ time naming the pigeons
——- after the four female employees
in the office: Kay, Ingrid, Marie and
Jan.

“These birds evidently have
been handled. They’re not skittish,”
Reynolds said. “There’s a lot‘ of ac-
tivity in the morning.” 3 _

Clerk Ingrid Albert said the
birds seem healthy and don’t have a

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - August 16, 1987

Private group tryinglo return

 

By John Flinn

-W Tl-E EXAMINER STAFF

' ' VENTANA WILDERNESS SANCI‘U-
ARY, Monterey County —- On a cool, foggy
morning last week, a young bald eagle cir-
cled slowly out of the sky and landed on a
man-made perch to survey its new home: a
rugged canyon south of Big Sur.

The majestic bird of prey and three
others like it are part of a bold effort to
restore the national symbol to California’s

Central Coast, where no bald eagles have

nested in more than half a Century.

“The bald eagle symbolizes courage and t ‘
freedom, and 1 think we can all be inspired ‘

by these birds," said wildlife biologist
Glenn Stewart. 7 '

‘ Once plentiful along the West Coast
from Alaska to Baja California, the bald
eagle is now a rare sight in California skies.
Only 68 breeding pairs are known to exist,
most in the extreme northern part of the
state. . '.

But the Ventana Wilderness Sanctuary,
a small, private organization hopes to re-

.lease’about 40 bald eagles during the next

five years on its 240 acres in Anderson '

Canyon, overlooking Highway 1 and the
Pacific Ocean.

The organization, founded by Carmel
Valley‘veterinarian Dr. Gerald Petkus and
realestate broker Salvatore Lucido, re-
ceives no money from the state or federal
governments. Instead, about two-thirds‘ef
its $28,000per-year budget comes from pri-

vate contributions. The rest comes from : V

grants from Chevron. International Busi-s‘
ness Machines Corp. and PG&E. - "

“The government just doesn’t have the
money to do this kind of work,” said Stew- 5
art, the group’s executive director. “Most .
of -our~money comes from $50 and $100 .
checks from people who want to see bald

eagles back in the area.”

In mid-June the organization’s biologists
captured four young eagles along the
Campbell River on Vancouver Island in
British Columbia. They used mountaineer- .
mg gear to reach treebranch aeries more

than 100 feet above the ground.

_ It was critical that the birds be 8 weeks

old. Younger eagles are not able to hold
food or keep themselves warm at night.
Older birds have already ”imprinted" on
the Campbell River site as their homes. '
After being snatched from their nests,
the young eagles were rushed to the Venta-
na Wilderness, where they were installed
in their new nest: a 30foot tower made of

telephone poles and plywood, commanding - '

a nice view of the Pacific Ocean.

 

pads that allow biologists to track
their movements.

. In their new home, they are pro
'tected from many of the dangers
that cause a high mortality rate
among young eagles. Unseen hands
provide a steady diet of fresh fish,

, ducks, geese, ground squirrels and

vrabbits.
“They’re actually getting a bet-
ter start in life here than they nor-
'mally would,” Stewart ”said. “In the

" «wild, there are days when the par-

ents don‘t catch any food. The

-' young birds go hungry.”

The eagles -— three female and

V" one male, already full-grown ,-——

'have spent the last month explor-

"ing their new home after learning

to soar on the cool breezes blowing
-in off the ocean.

While taking its first faltering
flight a few weeks ago, one of the
eagles made a clumsy landing and

anocked another eagle to the
:lground. In the wild. that bird would
. have become a meal for a mountain
ilibn or other predator. But biolo-
;,gists quickly grabbed the grounded
eagle and returned it safely to the
Ernest. ‘
” ~ i Apparently, the devel0pment of
the birds doesn‘t suffer when they

. are taken away from their parents,
‘ZaCCording to Stewart. Flying, hunt-

;in‘g and building a nest all come
:instinctively to eagles, he said.

. 1,. Stewart is fascinated by a phe
anmenon biologists are just begin-
:ning to study. At the age of 17 or 18
~ weeks, not long after they have tak-
len their first faltering flights, the
:adolescent eagles instinctively em-
:bark on a marathon journey north
to Alaska or British Columbia.

I ~ " Without stepping to eat, the
;birds cover as much as 300 miles a

~day. In one case an eagle outran an .

ilairplane trying to track it.
'; , "They make the flights by them-
selves, without following anyone

else up there,” Stewart said. “They
seem to have some sort of genetic
message that tells them there is an
abundance of salmon to eat there."
Two of the four eagles released
at the Ventana site disappeared
from the area last week, and Stew-
art believes they may be on their
way north. The other two will prob-
gably leave sometime this week.
‘ . After the salmon runs end, all
four should return to the Big Sur
coast in December or January, ac-
cording to Stewart. The eagles will
not nest until they reach sexual ma-
turity at about age 5. That is also
when they develop their trademark
Ewhite heads and tails.
. There were believed to be about
50,000 bald eagles in North America
, in 1782 when Congress selected the
,5 proud bird as the official symbol
for the fledgling nation. In doing so,
_ they ignored Benjamin Franklin,

Reasons Why Pit Bulls Are Mean

Editor:

In regard to the recent discus-
sions about banning the prolifera-
tion of pit bulls: I believe the issue
to be pursued is, "Why are vicious
do 5 purposely trained that way?”

0 reasons are readily appar-
ent: To be a guard dog, and to be
used in dog ﬁghts for gambling
pur oses.

ose who train dogs for pur-
poses of guarding property also
train the do 8 to obey commands, to
stop or ho d a erson or other
animal, and the ogs are usually
confined 'within an area or are on a
leash until commanded to perform.

Fighting do s are trained to ﬁght
to the kill an are ut into arenas
to do 'ust that w ile “humans”
stand y and cheer them on 'by
betting on their favorite killer. To
train these animals, young cats,
small dogs and other victims are
used to "egg the dogs on.”

It is pointless to try to change

.4... ...A

. ,s-,.,_.._.. ~._-...

someone who thinks of dog ﬁghts as
a "sporting game.” So, do we
continue to allow these dog ﬁghts to
continue, or do we ban them and
make the penalty such a stiff one,
both ﬁnancially and by sentencing
to jail, that people will ﬁnd it not
worthwhile to train dogs for gam-
bling purposes?

. Any dog that makes a habit of
killing smaller animals or attack-
ing children or grown-ups should be
conﬁned in a secure place or should
be on a leash with its owner in
charge, or should be put to sleep if
it cannot be controlled.

The owner is the one that trains
the dog, or does not train it, and he
or she should be held responsible.
After all, an animal reflects its
owner or trainer, having no other .
model to go by, other than its
animal nature.

DALLAS MORNING NEWS - August 17, 1987

Fellow Texans:

Your representatives in Austin, both Senate and House, approved two bills earlier this
year they believed critical in preventing animal cruelty in our state. GOVERNOR
CLEMENTS VETOED BOTHI , .

Why? That’s what we’ve been asking. The RIDING STABLE BILL (establishing minimum
humane standards for riding stables to protect horses from neglect and abuse) passed
the Senate and House without opposition. The THIRD OFFENSE BILL (changing the third
conviction of cruelty to an animal from a misdemeanor to a felony) had no opposition
except from “gamefowl breeders” (ever heard of .cocktighting? It’s illegal in Texas),
and their oppositon was overwhelming. Nevertheless, your Senators and Representa-
tives saw fit to vote favorably for it. And there would have been no cOst to the state to
implement these bills. w

ANIMALS NEED PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION! If you are doubtful, you need to know these
facts: .
-— The Humane Society of North Texas (Ft. Worth) received 3, 218 reports of cruelty in 1986. -- The Dallas SPCA and Animal Control received 2,246
cruelty reports the same year. ——- Humane Society cruelty investigators all over the state confirm animal abuse, abandonment, torture and neglect are
increasing. '

The RIDING STABLE BILL and the THIRD OFFENSE BILL, had they been signed by the Governor, would have reduced greatly the number of animal cruelty
cases in our state. We believe it, as do your Senators and Representatives who voted for both bills. What Governor Clements was told is anyone’s guess.
His veto proclamation was, “I am not persuaded this is a problem of sufficient statewide magnitude to warrant legislation of this breadth.” Yet statistics of
animal abuse show this legislation is desperately needed.

who wish to own an aggressive

other breeds of dogs that are
also «aggressive and. dangerous.

By increasing the legal risks
of ownership of dangerous or
potentially dangerous dogs, we

vicious animals even if the
“stash" has been flushed down

seeking aggressive traits has in-

The media must bear some
of the responsibility for this,
since they continue the hype

. ‘ Stupid pet trick me

We all search for
moments of glory.
For some, it comes
with a Nobel Prize.
For others, it’s win-
ning the big game.

, And, for a cho-
sen few, it’s ﬂying
LARRY R. ' with a dog to New
POWELL York City for a few

splendid, ' nation-

wide seconds on Late Night With David
Letterman. -

The dog’s name is CBOE -- from the Chi-
.c'ago Board of Exchange --— and her handler
is stockbroker David Fang. Yes, dog and
Fang. “I dread what Letterman’s going to
say,” says Fang, a native of the Bronx who
has lived in Dallas the past five years.

CBOE -— pronounced “see-beau” -- has
been chosen to perform in the show’s “Stu-
pid Pet Tricks” segment Friday night. (It
airs at midnight on KXAS, Channel 5.)

 

CBOE is a Dallas SPCA foundling adopted

about 41/2 years ago by Fang and his wife, ,

Mindy, also a stackbroker. “This dog is a
cross between .. aﬁerman shepherd and this
and that,” says Fang. “They didn’t really
know anything about her except that some-
body found her after she’d been thrown out
of a truck.”

Apply a little puppy love and sometimes
you’ll discover a
things is to p0p balloons,” says Fang.

Several weeks ago, when the Dallas SPCA
had a “Stupid Pet Tricks” benefit show, the
Fangs decided to let CBOE Show off. She did
so well, Fang says, that “we decided, ‘Let’s
give it a shot, let’s go for the big time.’ ”

Fang sent a letter to Late Night talent
scout Susan Hall-Sheehan, then followed
with a videotape of CBOE in action. Ms.
Hall-Sheehan said that was nice, but won-
dered if the dog could jump up and pop the
balloons in the air. “Any way you want it,”
replied Fang, who then sent a tape of 43-

'talent. “One of her favorite ’

the string on a helium~filled balloon, which
she wrestled to the ground and popped.

The Letterman people were charmed,
and CBOE and Fang flew to New York
Thursday night. The show covers travel ex-
penses for people and critters on the pet
segment. Stupid human tricksters get union
scale, $490, says Ms. Hall-Sheehan.

Mrs. Fang did not accompany the pair.
“We have another dog who is kind of neu-
rotic,” Fang says. “Rather than spend all the
money for her (Mrs. Fang) to ﬂy up and
have our dog destroy the house while we’re
gone, she’s going to stay in Dallas -— and
make sure the‘VCR works.” (The other dog,
Bandit, is a shepherd-Whippet mix, Fang
says. “She’s real fast, but real dumb.”)

Probably one of 10 tricksters will make it
to national TV, but Mrs. Hall-Sheehan en-
courages hopefuls to write to her at Stupid ‘
Pet Tricks, NBC, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Room }

Mrs. Hall-Sheehan says, “The best trick
are the ones you’d never think of .” She em
phasizes, “We’ve already weeded out dogs
playing dead in various ways.”

You might wonder how someone coult
rise that high in show business. Mrs. Hall
Sheehan says she was hired after the origi
nal talent scbut, Chris Elliott, became .
writer for the show. “I had done an intern

If this isn’t technical theater, what is?

concerne this failure eventually Wlll lead
him to a nervous breakdown, or even
worse. '

I have a great number of .trees in my
backyard and countless s ulrrels cavort

‘l amongst them. When Cat 1sh is outside

and spots a squirrel, he immediately
dashes after 1t.

The back of my house is a series of glass
doors, which remain closed most 0 the
time. Catﬁsh has not ﬁgured out the
theory of lass. He sees a squirrel. outside
and goes ashmg for it and runs into the
glass at apprommately 65 mph. ’

- "You can’t run through glass,” I tell him

after he has regained consolousness. He
gives me that amed, dlsappomted look
again, With hls attened nose and crossed
eyes. , ,

I’m torn here, as one might ima ine. I
want my dog to hve a happy, healt y life

and not become brain-damaged. Perhaps, I

have thought, if he were to catch just one
lousy squirrel, he would be free of the
obsession.

On the other hand, I don’t want any
harm to come to any of the squirrels who
live in my backyard. The ’re cute little
boogers, and I enjoy watc ing them run
around in the grass and straw looking for
whatever it is squirrels look for.

This experience —— and dilemma — has
taught me to have a reat deal of
appreciation for the order 0 nature.

Dogs naturally chase squirrels, but
squirrels are naturally faster than dogs.
T ey scam r up trees to get away from
dogs, who Iheave no earthly idea ow to
climb a tree. - .

Glass doors, on the-other hand, are not a
part of the natural order of things.

I simply hope that if one day Catﬁsh
crashes headfirst into another one in hot
pursuit of a squirrel and suffers a fatal
injury, he will somehow know it was the
door, not the squirrel, his avowed enemy,
that killed him. - ‘

Biotechnology ,’s New Strain of Strife

SUMMARY: With a Patent Ofﬁce ruling, controversy over biotechnology
has swelled. The agency said genetically modiﬁed animals can be
patented. Drugmakers, blotechnlcal firms and many scientists
rejoiced; farm lobbyists and animal rights and religious groups called

for a halt to such licensing. But will patenting do the ﬁrms much good?

new industrial order is upon us,

says Thomas E. Wagner, director

of the Edison Animal Biotechnol-

ogy Center at Ohio University. The age of

biotechnology will represent a quantum

leap forward from the age of chemical de-

velopments we have inhabited for the past

200 to 300 years. That medical beneﬁts

will abound in the new age is commonly

anticipated, but the fruits of this science

will extend into every sphere of life, Wag-

ner says. “Even the plastic of cars will
come from biotechnology.”

His wonder is Jeremy Riﬂcin’s fear. Rif-
kin, who has made a career of critiquing
biotechnology, sees the potential bonanza
as something that must be scrutinized care-
fully, lest it irnperil health and safety (In-
sight, July 20). More than that, he believes
that biotechnology, if used improperly, has
the power to upset the natural order of the
world and to threaten our very humanity.

Small wonder then, that a simple ruling
by the Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce has set
the stage for a major controversy, with
Wagner and Rifkin playing leading roles on
opposing sides. On April 3, the agency said
that animals could be patented if they had
been modiﬁed in a “nonnatural” way. In so
ruling, the ofﬁce cited a 1980 Supreme
Court decision, Diamond vs. Chakrabarty,
in which a patent was granted on a bac-
terium that had been modiﬁed biologically
to eat oil spills. The agency contended that
the court’s broad language paved the way
for patenting of higher organisms.

Wagner (above) views a wonderful
revolution; Rifkin fears disaster.

About 15 animal patent applications
were pending at the time of the ruling.
Since then, two sets of congressional hear-
ings have been held on the matter, and a
third was scheduled for Aug. 21 in Madi—
son, Wis. The congressional Ofﬁce of
Technology Assessment is already study-
ing animal patenting; a report is expected
this winter. On Aug. 5 North Carolina
Democrat Charlie Rose introduced a bill in
the House calling for a two-year mor-
atorium on animal patents.

SHEPARD SHERBELL / PICTURE GROUP

Supporting a moratorium is a coalition
of strange bedfellows, including farm lob-
byists, animal rights activists and religious
groups, notably the National Council of
Churches. Says Riﬂdn: “The US. Patent
Ofﬁce Board of Appeals in one stroke has
reduced the entire animal kingdom to a
commercial commodity.”

- Among those opposing a halt are phar-
maceutical ﬁrms, the Association of Bio-
technology Companies, assorted research-
ers and one farm lobby. “Already the Jap-
anese are producing vaccines for hepatitis
B in silkworrns,” says Wagner. To deny
patents on animals, even for two years,
would be tantamount to the United States’
relinquishing its dominance in the ﬁeld.

The current controversy is as much a
referendum on genetic engineering as it is
on patents. “Genetic engineering may ulti-
mately change the face of the world in
which we live. The question is whether the
change will be for good or ill,” Mark O.
Hatﬁeld of Oregon said earlier this sum-
mer, referring to a go—slow amendment the
Republican senator had attached to the Ur-
gent Supplemental Appropriation for ﬁscal
1987. The measure had been unanimously
adopted by the Senate but was later
dropped in conference with the House.

Biotechnology, including animal bio—
technology, is simple in principle. It is
based on manipulation of the genes, the
cellular entities that determine physical in-
heritance. Single genes determine simple
traits such as eye andhair color, while many
genes acting together inﬂuence many com-
plex traits such as intelligence. Genes also
code for the vast numbers of molecular
machines that run bodies. Some of these
are familiar, such as the hemoglobin that
carries oxygen from lungs to tissues. Many
will be mass-produced as drugs by biotech-
nology companies: human insulin; tissue
plasminogen activator, a blood clot dissolv-
ing substance that could treat heart attack
victims; interferon; and hormones.

In the 19703, scientists learned to trans-
fer genes from one organism into another.
The early work was done on bacteria, - be-
cause they are easier to manipulate geneti-
cally than are higher organisms. Many of ‘
the drugs that will emerge from biotechnol-
ogy are difﬁcult to synthesize chemically,
but splicing genes could turn microorgan-
isms into pharmaceutical factories.

Biotechnologists are now gaining the
ability to manipulatelthe genes of animals.
Recent controversy has centered on the en-
gineering of superior farm animals. En-
gineered cattle, for example, might pro-
duce leaner meat; dairy cows might pro-

dissemination of any patented technology. I do not,
think of animal patents as a big ethical issue”

 

duce milk already nutritionally enriched or
low in fat — the possibilities are limited
only by imagination. In a recent experi-
ment that heralds these kinds of develop-
ments, Scottish scientists transplanted a
gene for a milk protein from a sheep into
mice. The mice then produced the sheep
protein in their own milk.

Similarly, genes for human substances
could be spliced into livestock so that drugs
could be cranked out among milk or egg
proteins. The advantage of this, explains
Wagner, is that udders and eggs produce
vast quantities of proteins quickly.

Finally, genetic engineers will make
new animal models for the study of human
diseases. Many diseases are caused by de—
fective genes. Until now, researchers have
learned about human ones by studying the
effects of similar conditions on animals.
But not all human illnesses occur in ani-
mals convenient for lab study. With gene
splicing, defective genes could be inserted
into laboratory rodents to make artiﬁcial
animal models, says Wagner.

Patenting is necessary, he continues, so
that people can take full advantage of the
cornucopia of animal biotechnology. Inves-
tors simply will not invest unless their prop—
erty rights are protected. But Rifkin and
most farm groups see animal patenting as
one more step toward taking agriculture out
of the hands of the nation’s small farmers
and concentrating food production among
the multinational corporations. ,

Farm rights groups say they have seen it
all before. Various plant patenting acts were
passed around the world in the 19605 and
’70s, and the groups say the wholesale
takeover of an international seed industry
by chemical and pharmaceutical ﬁrms fol-
lowed. “Today, more than 120 seed com-
panies have been gobbled up by major cor-
porations, mostly multinationals,” says
Jack Doyle, author of “Altered Harvest.”

The consequences have been far-reach-
ing, says the critic of modern agriculture.
“Seed prices soared during the ’70s,” and
under the new ownership, products have
been designed more for the convenience of
the agricultural chemical and food process-
ing industries than for the nutrition of con-
sumers. “The genes that matter are those
of yield, tensile strength, durability, and
long shelf life,” he writes. “However, the
genes of nutrition — if considered at all —
are for the most part last in line.”

The consequences of plant patenting are
a matter of dispute. Agricultural econo-
mists William Lesser of Cornell University
and Bruce W. Marion of the University of
Wisconsin agree that patentability takes the

 

credit for getting large companies inter-
ested in seed. But, Lesser insists, “I have
heard no credible, claims that the prices of
seeds have gone out of sight.” The industry
consolidation may not be bad: Large cor-
porations can be important sources of capi-
tal for research and development. Marion
hastens to warn, however, that too much
concentration could create a conflict “be-
tween providing an incentive for R and D
through a patent system and the possible
monopoly power that might develop.’

But those who favor animal patents see
the fruits of genetic engineering in a more
favorable light. “When [large companies]
ﬁrst got involved with agriculture, they
were not too knowledgeable and they
stressed increasing yields,” admits A. Ann
Sorensen, assistant director of the natural
and environmental resources division of the
propatenting American Farm Bureau Fed-
eration. But today, she says, “we have to
look at increasing the farmers’ net income.”
To reduce farmers’ costs, biotechnologists

Scientists using gene transfer technology have doubled the size of some mice.

By analogy to the problems they see in
plant patenting, animal patenting oppo-
nents fear that farmers will not own animals
but instead raise them for large corpora-
tions that will process and market them, as
already occurs in the poultry industry. “In
essence, you would be reducing livestock
farmers to the baby-sitters of livestock,”
says R. Keith Stroup, attorney and lobbyist
for the League of Rural Voters.

The opponents further see animals be-
ing engineered, as are plants, for the conve-
nience of the food processors rather than
taking into account the interests of small
farmers, consumers or the animals them-
selves. They also say agriculture is already
so productive that fast-growing animals or
hyperproductive milk cows will only
squeeze more farmers off their land.

could design disease-resistant animals and
animals that require less food.

As for the critique that patenting would
take animals out of the hands of farmers,
Wagner argues that precisely the opposite
is true. If animals cannot be patented, man-
ufacturers of improved livestock will pro—
tect their interests by licensing them to
large, vertically integrated companies. “If
you don’t allow high-tech animal patents,
you will put the animals into the hands of
single multinationals. But once the animals
are patented, it’s to the beneﬁt of the inven-

' tor to sell to as many people as possible’

The details remain to be worked out for
preserving patent rights on self-reproduc—
ing entities. In her testimony at the July 22

Not all biot

the Administration of Justice, Sorensen de-
scribed some of the problems patent own-
ers would face. “If a genetically modiﬁed
dairy cow who produces low-fat milk is
crossed with a bull on the farm, does the
patent follow the gene wherever it goes?
Will farm animals be put through regular
gene checks to make sure farmers pay all
due royalties and license fees?”

Robert P. Merges, a Columbia School
of Law fellow in law, science and technol-
ogy, expects that licensing agreements will
resolve many such issues. “In other areas
where intellectual property rights involve
difﬁcult problems of infringement and en-
forcement, such as in the licensing of com-
puter software, the parties involved have
demonstrated a signiﬁcant level of creativ-
ity in drafting contractual provisions that
are responsive to the problems at hand,” he
told the subcommittee. '

Both witnesses stressed the need for
' Congress to consider a so—called farmers
exemption that would allow farmers to use
offspring of patented animals on their own
farms without paying royalties. “Although
the burden of establishing infringement is
normally upon the patentee, patent licens-
ing agreements might require farmers to
keep records concerning breeding activities
involving patented animals,” says Merges.
“An exemption would remove this burden.”

Nor would an exemption destroy the
market for an invention. According to the
principle of genetic drift, with each genera-
tion ever smaller numbers of animals would
possess a patented trait. This would force
farmers to acquire patented animals every
few generations if they wanted to maintain
the trait among their herds, he says.

The harshest opponents of animal pat-
enting remain religious groups. A state-
ment recently released by the National
Council of Churches outlined a variety of
concerns. “Reverence for all life created by
God may be eroded by subtle economic
pressures to view animal life as if it were
an industrial product invented and man-

f. ' h - i »m;:‘.. .

ufactured by humans. Further, the combin-
ing of human genetic traits with animals,
with the result to be patented and owned,
raises unique moral, ethical, and theo-
logical questions.”

But Samuel Gorovitz, professor of phi-
losophy at Syracuse University, thinks that
animal patenting represents a trivial exten-
sion of economic pressures to exploit other
species. “I wonder if these people also take
offense at the breeders of racehorses or the
dairy farmer who owns cattle,” he says.

., nd Donald E. Miller, general secre-

9"?" tary of the Church of the Brethren

General Board, calls “alarmist” the

fears about combining traits of different

animals with each other, or with those of

humans. Transplanting single genes will

not blur the line between species, he says.

Enzymes and hormones “do not distinguish
human bodies from animal bodies.”

Such gene transfers from one species to
another occur among bacteria in nature and
may occur among higher animals as well.
But Miller says any gene transfer that could
give animals characteristics of humanity or
combine characteristics of two or more spe-
cies into a single animal remains in the
realm of science ﬁction.

“Most of the problems are ones that
arise with the control and dissemination of
any patented technology,” says Alexander
M. Capron, a law professor at the Law
Center at the University of Southern Cali-
fornia, who headed the President’s Com-
mission on Bioethics. “I do not think of
animal patents as a big ethical issue.”

Animal rights activists support a mor-
atorium on animal patents because they see
genetic experiments on animals as a threat
not to the economy or to spiritual values
but to animal welfare. “There will be suf-
fering in the creation of new species,” says
Michael W. Fox, the scientiﬁc director for
the Humane SOCiety of the United States.
The problem is that modiﬁcations which
drastically alter some aspect of animal

physiology or structure can create a host of
medical problems, in much the same way
that placing a truck engine in a Chevette
would create mechanical problems. For ex-
ample, among the food-efﬁcient “super-
pigs” genetically engineered recently by
the Department of Agriculture, many that
were not stillborn were crippled with arthri-
tis and had weak immune systems that left
them prone to pneumonia, says the depart-
ment’s Vernon G. Pursel.

But Andrew N. Rowan, dean of Tufts
University’s School of Veterinary Medicine
and a strong proponent of reducing suffer-
ing in scientiﬁc experiments (Insight,
Aug. 3), says such problems are insufﬁ-
cient reason to ban animal patents or ex-
periments relating to the ﬁeld since suffer-
ing also occurs in other ethical research.

Even many who are not too wonied
about the effects of animal patenting sup-
port a moratorium because they think the
issue is so big that it should be decided by
legislation. Zsolt P. Harsanyi thinks there
is plenty of time to resolve the controversy
without jeopardizing the industry. Scientist
and businessman, Harsanyi is chief execu-
tive ofﬁcer of Porton International, which
he says is the world’s largest privately held
biotechnology company. Before taking
over at Porton, he directed the Ofﬁce of
Technology Assessment’s 1981 study on
the impact of applied genetics.

To begin with, he says, superior live-
stock is a long way in the future. “I don’t
see a major jump that will make an animal
that much more valuable because of genetic
engineering. I don’t think we have enough
knowledge about the important genes in
improving animals.”

. He sees animal pharmaceutical factories
as “still a little in the realm of science
ﬁction. One reason is if the pharmaceutical
had some potency, you would expect it to
affect the animal’s metabolism.” He con-
cedes that eggs, isolated as they are from
the animal, might be suitable vessels for
drug production, but he warns that the Food
and Drug Administration would carefully
scrutinize any pharmaceuticals made that
way and questions why a ﬁrm would bother
with the hassles of animals when “we are
coming up with real good bioreactors,” ves-
sels used to house bacteria for production
of genetically engineered materials.

All in all, the industry may have less to
gain from patents than it thinks, says Har-
sanyi. “Fifty percent of all patents are
found to be too broad. They offer some
security, but I’d say it’s a false sense of
security.”

their habitat. I understand now that the fines imposed on
those who shoot bald eagles don't even cover the cost of
bringing these people to 'trial,1£n;alone restoring the

wilful destruction, with a fine and a sentence in jail.

Increased Funding ~ I understand many species waiting to

Many oI the actions planned to help wolves and grizzly
bears (and everyon ewho is at all interested in wildlife

Every American should be interested in protecting our
wildliIe, especially those animals on the Verge of ex-

sparrow in Florida, let us not add one more animal or
bird or plant to the list oI those which have become
extinct. I urge you and all members of Congress to
authorize and appropriate $80 million Ior Fiscal Year
1988 to be increased to $105 million by Fiscal Year
1992. We really have no idea how mankind has suIIered
so far through the losssof so much of our wildlife and
fauna.

 




Protecting Wildlife Overseas: Agencies must consult with the
Interior Dept. concerning the effect of their actions on en-
dangered species in foreign countries. The Interior Dept.
recently withdrew the regulation requiring this consultation.
Please vote to see that this is re-introduced.

Establishing a.anitoring System: As I understand it, we have
already lost 80 species waiting to be added to the Endangered
Species list. The Interior Dept. should be required to monitor
caididates waiting to be listed so they can be added swiftly
if facing significant threats.

Protecting Endangered Plants: These should be protected no
matter where they are - federal or private land, and tres-
pass to steal them should be made violations of the Act.

I have .already written you re the Turle Excluder Devices.
I find it difficult to believe that fishermen are so re~
luctant to spend a little extra money to protect turtles.

Please oppose the following weakening amendments:

Endangered predators: The hunter, trapper and the state fish
and game departments have pretty well had their way in the
past re all of our wildlife, and I am personally sick and
tired of hearing that they have this right because they pay
to kill. All Americans have a right and interest in wild
animals on OUR PUBLIC LAND ~ not just the killing element.
Anyone who has done any reading at all about our wildlife,
knows full well of the condition of the grizzly bear and the
wolf, and under no circumstances should these animals be
hunted and killed. The very use of the word "sport" when it
comes to killing and maiming animals, or trapping them, is a

sickening display of how little the hunter really knows, or
cares about our animals.

l would like to hear from all of you on this matter which is of great
importance to me.

Thank you .

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough

 




 

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - August: 1?, 1987

Raid Called
Setback For
Dog Fights

By 3111 Smith
Oi the Post- Dispatch Staff

A weekend raid at the home of a
man suspected of breeding and train-
ing pit bull terriers to fight may have
crippled one of the largest dog-fight-
ing operations in the state, a humane
society official said Monday.

But the owner of the 46 animals
denied Monday that he had ever used
any of his dogs for fighting. He also
accused officials of the humane soci-
ety and police of “stepping way out of
bounds” in the raid, Saturday morn-
ing in southwestern Missouri.

“Any time you bring 20 loaded
shotguns in on a person’s home, that’s
pretty strong,” said Herman “Bush”
Clark, 43, who lives in a rural area
five miles from the tiny community
of Lampe in Stone County.

“There was a 12-year-old boy here

at the time they came in, and he wet
his pants,” Clark said. ”His parents
Say he’s still in shock. "

Clark described himself as an un-
employed construction worker. He
has been charged with owning and
training dogs with the intent to fight
them, a felony. He‘ was charged also
with felony possession of marijuana
after the drug was found in his home,
‘-»authorities said. They estimated that
the marijuana had a street value of
$100, 000.

Clark was released from jail Mon-
day on $20, 000 bond and is scheduled

shelter at 1210 Macklind Avenue, with one of the pit bull terriers
taken in a raid Saturday in Stone County.

 




Dogs

 

From page one

to appear at a preliminary hearing in
Galena on Sept. 28.

, Besides the marijuana and several

weapons, a humane society official
said police also had seized four of
Clark’s dogs, a makeshift dog-fighting
pit made from plywood and carpet-
ing, a videotape of a dog fight, sever-
al treadmills used to exercise the ani-
mals and several dog-fighting
contracts.
_ Donald H. Anthony, general man-
_ ager of the Humane Society of Miss-
ouri, accompanied 21 police officers,
sheriff‘s deputies and highway patrol-
.men on the raid. He called the arrest
of Clark “the biggest in this state’s
history” on charges relating to dog
fighting.

“He was up there in terms of his

stature in the dog-fighting arena,”
Anthony said of Clark.

Anthony called some people in the
area “world class dog fighters.”

“For some of them, it’s their only
means of support,” he said.

The makeshift fighting pit was
found in a garage near the home,
Anthony said. “There were pieces of
plywood probably 30 inches high and
a piece of carpeting about 16-foot
square. There were blood stains three
feet across on that carpeting.”

Anthony said five dog-fighting con-

tracts also had been found in the"

home. But Clark said he had no such
contracts.
' -' Anthony said dog fighting trophies

were found in the house, but Clark‘

said his only trophies were dog
weight- pulling trophies, horse and
dog show trophies and rooster fight-
ing trophies. Rooster fighting is legal
in Missouri

Anthony said the raid was the cul-
mination of a three- -year investigation
by the humane society.

“This is just a brutalizing thing,”
Anthony said of dog fighting.

He speculated that other dog train-
ers and fighters in the area would “go
underground” for a while as a result
of Clark 3 arrest.

“As for long term, I just don’t know
what effect it’s going to have,” Anth-
ony said.

Four of the pit bull terriers -— each
weighing about 40 pounds —— are be-
ing held at the humane society’s ken-
nels in St. Louis. Anthony said the
animals that were seized showed ob-
vious signs that they have been in
fights.

one of the dogs had multiple scars

on its head and face. Its ears were cut.

close to the head. A humane society
investigator said the cropping is done
so the dog’s ears cannot be grabbed
by the opposing dog in a fight.

Clark said he had begun raising the
dogs as a hobby 12 years ago and
used them only for shows, in weight-
pulling contests and “for
companionship.’

“It keeps me off the streets and out \

of the bars, ” he said.

“This is all a bunch of hooey, a
bunch of harassment, a political step-
pingstone for the humane society,”
Clark said of the raid.

“Pit bulls are not'any more danger-
ous than any other dogs. The humane
society and the news media have cre-
ated a monster.

‘Dogs Bite Woman At Bethalto Store

Police in Bethalto are looking for
two dogs that bit a woman at an ice-
- cream stand Saturday night. ‘

The woman was treated for we

wounds on both legs at Wood River
Township Hospital and released. She
told police that she believed the dogs
were pit bull dogs.

Bethalto police officer Dave Fitz- "

gerald said he was unsure of the dogs’
breed. The woman told police that
she had been able to shake the dogs
off after the attack. .

“It doesn’t sound characteristic of a
pit bull attack,” Fitzgerald said Mon-
day. “You don’t shake them loose
easily.”

The woman told police that she had
approached a walk-up window at the
Dari Palace restaurant, at Illinois
Route 140 and Prairie Street, about
10:50 pm. Saturday when the two
dogs ran up. Each hit her on one leg.

She suffered a deep cut on the right _.

ankle and a puncture wound on the
ileft leg, police said.

“How manyspoodle dogs have you
seen that will bite you?” asked Clark.
“1 will not keep a man- biting dog. I
wouldn’t sell one under any circum-
stances; I wouldn’t give them away. I
dispose of them.

“People are always telling me how:
strong and how vicious they are,”
Clark said. “I tried to get the police to
go down there and kick one to see if
they would even growl at them.”

While Clark denied that he used his
dogs for fighting, he said he was un-
aware of what happens to the dogs he
sells or gives to friends.

“I don’t sell them for fighting dogs,
but as far as I'm concerned, if I sold
you one I wouldn’t tell you what to do
with it. . ,

“I’d say there are probably some
aspects of it that may be cruel to
“some people and not to others.”

He declined to say whether he had
ever attended a dog fight. .
“‘Whether I hate or haven’t isn’t

the public’s business,” he said.

As for the treadmills found on his
property, Clark said he used the ,
equipment to exercise the dogs in-
stead of taking them for walks. He
said the treadmills were not used to
train dogs for fighting. ' "

“You can’t make a dog fight," he
said. “If they want to fight, it‘s their
natural instinct.”

Anthony said Clark’s case would
mark one of the first times that au-
thorities have prosecuted under a
new dog fighting law.

The law requires only that prosecu-
tors prove that dog owners kept the
animals with an intent to use them -

‘for fighting, not that they actually

took part in a fight.
Mark Rundel, Stone County prose-
cuting attorney, said violation of the

if law allows a prison sentence of up to
five years and a fine of up to $5,000.

Rundel said Monday he was “not

i foreclosing the possibility” that
charges could be filed against other
F people connected with the case.

Rundel declined to speculate on

how widespread dog fighting may be
’ in the Stone COunty area.

“All I’ve ever heard are rumors,”
he said. “But I can’t imagine one per-
son having a monopoly on this.”

Taking part in the raid were the
Stone County Sheriff’s office, the
Missouri Highway Patrol, the Miss-
ouri Water Patrol, and the police de-
partments of Crane and Kimberling
City.

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

At the state penitentiary in Canon City, prisoners prepare to saddle break a mustang

These Cowboys Are Convicts

. nder a big sky on the
Colorado plains, Rory
Robinson, doing ﬁve years
for burglary, is uneasily
making the acquaintance of
a gray mare that once ran
wild and free. Robinson and
'the mustang have much in
common: both have been
corralled in the Colorado
State Prison to be tamed.
Tense beneath her ﬁrst
Saddle and conﬁned to a

lays back her ears indig- Aschool of hard knocks

nantly. Robinson, 28, tall

and powerfully built, eases atop the ani-
mal, and she erupts in furious leaps. Fel-
low convicts pull Robinson to safety. Re-
leased into the corral, the mare kicks like
a ninja assassin as cowboys in green pris-
on garb shout and wave their Stetsons to
keep her from banging into the fence.
Robinson climbs on again and seconds lat-
er is bucked into the dust. Yet even a wild
horse eventually tires. Another man
mounts up, the mare crow-hops a bit, stiff-
legged and snorting. But her ﬁght is gone.

When Prison Superintendent Harry
B. Johnson ﬁrst heard of the proposal that
convicts tame wild mustangs under the
Federal Bureau of Land Management’s
nationwide “adopt a horse” program, he
feared the only results would be “injuries
and lawsuits.” Now Johnson tells of hard-
case cons transformed into amiable cow-
pokes. “They are proud of the horses and
proud of what they can do,” says he of the
30 men in the program.

Wild-horse enthusiasts are equally de—
lighted. In 1985 the BLM rounded up
17,000 of the estimated 50,000 mustangs
that have overgrazed public rangeland,
mainly in Nevada and Wyoming. The bu-
reau offered the horses for “adoption” at
$125 a head, but buyers found the animals
‘ unmanageable.

 

Last year BLM Range
. : : Conservationist Walter Ja-

" » kubowski persuaded au-
thorities at the Colorado
State Prison complex in
Caﬁon City to let convicts
break the horses. Most of the
inmates are city bred, and
none have had equine expe-
rience. In one year the con—
vict-cowboy program has
tamed more than 400 mus-
tangs. Another 350 horses
are corralled at the prison to
be trained at the rate of
about ten a day. Most are
only halter broken, rather than readied
for saddlework.

To become a cowboy, a prisoner must
be near the end of his term: the horse cor-
rals are outside the prison security system,
and an inmate inclined to ﬂee need only
cross an alfalfa ﬁeld and a low barbed-
wire fence. No one has done so yet. Corral
Boss Tony Bainbridge observes, “The
meanest ones seem to make the best
hands. You come out here and think
you’re a tough guy—we’ll ﬁnd out.” He

says, “A 900-lb. horse can move you»

around more than you expect.”

Some men say they hope to use their
new skills to get jobs as veterinarians’ as-
sistants or as hot-walkers and groomers at
racetracks when they get out of prison.
Veterinarian Ron Zaidlicz, founder of the
National Organization for Wild Ameri-
can Horses, teaches the inmates how to
groom and care for the horses. In 1985
Zaidlicz and other NOWAH members rode
mustangs from Colorado to Washington
to lobby for better protection of the wild
horses. “I was asked why I cared about
horses when people were homeless and in
so much trouble.” Zaidlicz gestured to-
ward a knot of inmates intently working
with a mustang. “In a way, this answers

that.” ——By James Willwerﬂi/Caﬁan City

 

 

 

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - 8/12/87

A Man’s Best Friend ‘

As a longstanding owner of a pit bull, I feel
that several misconceptions are still present
toward the breed. True, they are bred for
aggressive behavior. But this fact is often
used as an excuse to vindicate owners who
do not take the mandatory precautions when
handling the breed. Owners of pit bulls must
realize the added responsibility associated
with ownership of the dog: Restriction is the

, solution.

I applaud the owners who turned their pit
bulls into the pound after learning of their
potential behavior. These people have no,
business owning such a dog. I must also con-
demn these people for not having the fore-
sight to research this particular breed before
the purchase. The purchase of any dog is a
major decision; at the very least, the pur-
chaser should do some research on its breed.

Let us not react in the extreme and call for
the. banishment of the breed. Many breeds of
dogs are potentially dangerous, but people
would not want to set a legal precedent of
banishment. Tomorrow the outcry could be
over German shepherds or Rottweilers.

Finally, we should concentrate our puni-
tive efforts where they belong: on the dog
owner. Contrary to present'belief, it is the
owner — not the dog -— who is in control of
the animal’s behavior. My late 10-pound
Cairn terrier would not hesitate to bite any-
thing. My pit bull, raised under stricter con-
trols, is the antithesis of that. Environment is
the determining factor in the behavior of the
animals.

:iNeW director has
plans for shelter

 

By Thomas Jordan
Staff Reporter

 

Robert E. Lee 11 smiled wryly,
as if he had anticipatedthe ine-

vitable question: ‘

Are pit bull terriers more dan-

gerous than other’dogs?

“That’s a lot like asking ‘Is a 38
(BB-caliber pistol) more danger-
ous than a 32?’ ” replied Lee, the

new manager of the city Animal

Shelter. “Any animal’s got a pro-
.. pensity towards being a danger-

ous animal. There is always the
possibility that an animal can
end up injuring someone.”
‘ There is no question, though,
’ that a steel-jawed pit bull has the
‘. ability to inflict serious injury,
. or to kill, Lee said. There have
. been no reports of deaths caused

MEMPHIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL - August 23, 1987 -

by pit bulls here, but the animals
have been responsible for six
deaths in the nation this year.
Fears about pit bulls have
reached the City Council. A com-
mittee has been assigned to lis-
ten to experts such as Lee to de-
termine whether legislation is

. needed to constrain the animals.

Cities across the nation have
enacted laws imposing re-

straints on pit bulls and their ‘

owners. Some municipalities
have outlawed the breed. .

Lee’s view of pit bulls is based
on 10 years in animal control.

.During that time, Lee, 40, has

written animal control legisla-
tion in Louisiana and has been a

, consultant to city and county hu-

mane agencies, animal control
offices and health departments
in the Southeast.

Lee, who is vice president of

the National Animal Control As- ‘

sociation, came to Memphis
from Baton Rouge, La., where he

._-...v. ,..__‘..__._~.._.. i. H ,.

SOme viciousness is owner’s,
not pit bull’s, official says

was director of the Animal Con-
trol Center. His annual salary
here is $37,000.

During a recent interview, he
said pit bulls have become popu-
lar because they are powerful
and aggressive.

“There is a segment of society
right now that likes the charac-
teristics that a pit bull embodies.
They like the aggressiveness,
the never-say-die spirit that the
breed has, and a lot of times
they’ll apply that in a really
poorly thought-out fashion.”

Lee said many pit bull owners
“encourage the animals to have
a lot of very dominant personal-
ity characteristics.”

On the other hand, he said,
there are many pit bulls that
wouldn’t hurt a kitten if it were

> placed in the dog’s mouth.

-A decade ago, Lee said, Dober-
man pinschers were getting bad
publicity.

While animals
at 200 take it easy

By John Corr
and Edward Colimore
Inquirer Staff Writers . -.
A sympathetic soul, wilting un-
, der the hammer of yesterday’s un-
' ~ speakable heat, is Bill Donaldson.
; 'president of the Philadelphia Zoo.

It’s close to 100 degrees, Bill.
How are the animals holding up?

“I think they‘re worried about
the people.”

What? -

“Well, the animals know how to
deal with the heat. They find. a
cool. shady place and lie down
and think things over. And they
watch the people. The people walk
around, carry things, stand in the
sun. I get the feeling the animals
worry' about them.”

Donaldson doesn’t worry about
the animals:

“We don’t! do anything special
on days like this, except for the
ice. Today,- we lreceivedl some big
blocks of ice, about 50 pounds
each. and dunked some of them in
the polar bears’ pool. '

“lt cools off the water a little.
but that’s not critical. What‘s
more important is that the bears
have so much fun playing with
the ice blocks. They get them un-
der their bellies and drift down to

al.

at their block of ice until discov7,
ering it was there to lick. The
elephants were less cautious.

“The elephants started to push

‘ the ice around with their trunks,
Like hockey pucks. it developed
into a game. Animals like to play,
even when it’s hot,” Donaldson
said. ..

When they finished playing,
they cracked the ice with a couple
of steps and began eating it.

Donaldson said he arrived at

the zoo yesterday, as usual, about
7:30 am, and visited the primates‘
area.
7 “They were all out and moving
around, eating, being busy. Then I
went back about 10 o‘clock, and
they were all settled down,
stretched out in the shade and
taking it easy."

The inhabitants of the wolf .
woods section of the zoo went a
bit further, he said.

“The wolves dig little ditches
for themselves, because the earth
is cooler beneath the surface.
They dig a hole, lie in it and take
it easy. Humans could learn from '
them."

The tigers,'he said, spent most
of the day in their meat.

THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC - Phoenix - August 15, 1987

:Curatcr’s collection ofwildlife in FIOrida had a catch to it

Wayne Homan, the Phoenix Zoo’s general curator,
_ had his own private "zoo” in his back yard while
. growing up in southern Florida.

“I’ve always been interested in wildlife and natural
sciences,” he said. “Growing up in southern Florida in
I the 1930s was an ideal situation. It was a tropical

paradise -— just all kinds of wildlife.” ,

' Homan collected raccoons and a variety of snakes.
He also captured alligators. ‘

“In those days, you could have theni legally,” he

said: "So we just went out and caught them.”

His mother didn’t share his enthusiasm for wildlife.

“My mother was deathly afraid of snakes,” Homan
said. “I was only allowed to have one in the house at a
time. I used to keep a big indigo snake in my-bedroom,
which caused me to make my own bed (and clean) my
own room because she refused to go in.” .

His mother breathed easier when Homan left for the
University of Florida, where he majored in zoology.

After graduation, he worked fo

When the Phoenix Zoo opened in 1962, Homan was
hired as curator of reptiles. Three years later, he
became general curator, which means he is responsible
for the care of the nearly 1,200 animals at the zoo. '

All the animals have names. Some were named by
the public in zoo contests, but the majority were named
by keepers. , .

“We have to be careful. (The keepers) say George is
sick or George is doing that,” Homan said. "We say,
‘Which George?’ ”

There was a time when big-game hunters roamed

‘ the world capturing animals, reptiles and birds for zoo
i

collections.

Today, zoos must rely on each other and nature to
ﬁll their collections.

Although some companies still make expeditions to
capture wildlife for zoos, governments around the
world have put a lid on the export and import of a
growing number of species.

Gorillas, for instance, cannot be imported. A couple
of years ago, two young gorillas were up for adoption in
West Germany. They were orphans; their parents in
Africa had been killed by natives either for food or for
trophies.

. "American zoos jumped for the chance to get them,

ﬁling import permits’ said Wayne Homan, general
curator of the Phoenix Zoo. The U. S. government,
however, denied their requests.

“They (federal officials) didn’t want to encourage
any commercialization in an endangered species,”
Homan said.

"Back in the ’50s, when zoos began to realize that
animals were beginning to be in short supply, (zoos)
started breeding programs,” he added. “If these
animals are going to be left on Earth for our
grandchildren to see, we had better breed them.”

The International Species Inventory System, a
computer inventory of all animals in most of the
world’s zoos (excluding those in Russia and China),
fhfws that zoo breeding programs have been success-
11

Currently, according to its ﬁgures, 65 percent of all
animals 1n zoos have been born 1n captivity.

"Every year that (ﬁgure) goes up,” Homan said.

More importantly, zoos that have animals they want
to breed can tap the system’ s computer to determine

. which zoos elsewhere have potential mates.

When an agreement is reached between zoos,
officials sign a breeding loan contract, and the animals
are paired. Usually, Homan said, the first-born
offspring goes to the zoo housing the breeding pair.

The Phoenix Zoo probably has 12 breeding loans
going on at any given time, he added.

Not all of these man-made matches end in success.
Such is the case with Hazel, the Phoenix Zoo’s
27- ear-old female lowland gorilla.

he has been introduced to several males through
the years, but has produced only one offspring, Fabayo,
in 1975. That was when she bred successfully with
Trib, the San Diego Zoo’s male gorilla. Fabayo, now 12,
lives at the Memphis (Tenn. ) Zoo

Congo, a male gorilla from a Honolulu zoo, has been

In May 1986, Hazel was sent on loan to the San
Diego Wild Animal Park to breed with Winston, the
park’s breeding male. Although they bred frequently,

P

 

  

 

Of the world’s zoo animals, about 65 percent were
born in captivity.

Hazel came home in June 1987 with empty arms.

"We don’t know exactly why Hazel did not
conceive,” Homan said. "As a rule, gorillas in captivity
do not reproduce all that readily, but compounding
that fact is her age. By gorilla standards, Hazel is
middle-aged and may be beyond her prime child—bear-
ing years.”

Although Hazel has been a baby-making disappoint-
ment for ‘the Phoenix Zoo, other animals have been
proliﬁc. On July 14, Tambile, an 18-year-old white
rhinoceros, delivered her fifth live offspring in 12
years.

Also, the Phoenix Zoo gained worldwide notice in
the 19608 when it bred the rare Arabian oryx. At the
time, an estimated 30 of the animals were left on
Earth. Nine were gathered — from European zoos, the
wild and a private collection —— and sent to the Phoenix

’ Zoo for breeding. Of those, one male was sterile and

one female was barren, leaving seven for breeding.

A few years later, the Los Angeles Zoo obtained two
more oryxes, and cross-breeding between the zoos
began. A total of 189 oryxes have been born at the
Phoenix Zoo since then. Now, the world’s oryx herd

 

numbers 400, and some have been returned to the wild. ‘
Zoos are cautious of inbreeding, and often ship.
offspring to other zoos on breeding loans or trade them
for other animals. The Phoenix Zoo has shipped most.
of its oryx offspring to zoos in the United States,
Europe and Israel. i
Sometimes, zoo animals are pregnant and their ,,
keepers don’t know it until the baby arrives.
That happened more than once with Tambile theg
rhinoceros. She weighs about 3 tons, and an offspring '
weighs only about 100 pounds. _ ._ .
“It doesn’t create a heck of a bulge,” said Dick?
George, the zoo’s public-relations manager. —
Homan said. “Most wild animals don’t show"
pregnancies to a great extent, and that is because of ;
the need for survival. They have to be active and they? .
have to be agile. A pregnant African lion still has to.
hunt and find its food (and) be able to run and make its "
kill while 1n the last term of pregnancy.’ 1
When animals do deliver, they can have their young. ,
without much help from zoo keepers. ‘
“They don’t get assistance in the wild,” Homan said.
“What we have to watch for 1n captivity is mainly to '
give them necessary quarters, or the necessary".
environment, for them to have their young. '
"Some animals become extremely sensitive and
destroy their offspring if not given the privacy they
need.” '
That' 1s not the only problem zoo officials have with, .
newborn animals. The mothers sometimes shun their"

young.

Dutchess, the 200’s female orangutan, has a histOry
of abandoning her young. '
“Her ﬁrst young. .she was scared of it,” Homan
said. “She placed it on the shelf and walked away from

. it and wouldn’t go back. ”

Zoo keepers rescued the baby and raised it. When'
she delivered another time, Dutchess refused to care
for that baby, too. - 4,

When she had a third offspring, however, zoo :
keepers bottle-fed it for a while. They tranquilized —
Dutchess and returned the baby to her. The mother I
accepted the baby and raised it herself. ;

Although zoos are placing more emphasis on ;
propagating animals in their collections, there are ~
some animals, such as African lions, that rarely are I
bred anymore because there is an overabundance. j

The Phoenix Zoo uses contraceptives on its big cats. ;
The contraceptive is placed under the skin of a female, .
where it releases a hormone into the blood stream. The I
contraceptive lasts for about two years. ;

"Lions are very easy to breed in captivity,” Homan -

s.aid Most zoos already have lions for display, and zoos 1
want to make sure the extra animals go to institutions .
that have adequate facilities, he said.

“With a surplus, it gets to the point that you can’t
ﬁnd adequate homes. Therefore, you have to stop
breeding.”

 




 

USA TODAY - August 20,

Scientists are still bafﬂed by
what is killing dolphins from Vir-
ginia to New Jersey, and it could
be weeks before they narrow
down a cause, marine scientists
said Wednesday.

They knew it’s a bacterial infec-
tion that killed more than 200 bott-
lenwe dolphins that have washed
ashore in the Mid-Atlantic region
this summer —- compared with a
dozen in a normal year.

But what scientists don’t know is
why suddenly the mammals have
become susceptible to certain bac-
teria that have always been there,
said Dr. Joseph Geraci, leader of a
team of scientists studying the dol-
phin deaths in Virginia Beach, Va.

Next step: Researchers will try
to identifyviruses, organisms and
pollution that may have weakened
the dolphins’ immune system.

The ﬁrst reports of dolphin
deaths came from New Jersey on
July 6. .

There’s no evidence humans

could be aﬁected by the dolphins’

problem, Geraci said.

Part of the mystery: Are the ani-
mals infecting each other, or were
they exposed to something that
damaged their immune systems?

Most of the playful sea creatures
apparently suffered painful
deaths: Many have skin ulcers and
blood in their chest cavities.

In some cases, the skin is so “de-
vitalized” that it peels like “Saran
Wrap,” Geraci said.

The bacteria is killing the ani-
mals by causing massive internal

bleeding The bacteria destroys
the animal’s blood-vessel walls, al-
lowing blood to seep into brain and
body cavities and causing the skin
to peel and ulcerate.

Other scientists along the East
Coast are also at work:

I News that the federal scien-

tists linked a common ocean bacte- .

rium, Vibrio, to the deaths came as
no surprise to researchers in New

tor of the Marine Mammal Strand-

when bottlenose dolphins swam
near his boat during his ﬁshing
trips on Delaware Bay.

So when the 46-year-old New

attack Monday after returning
from ﬁshing his family decided
to set up a memorial fund for
the ailing dolphins.

His widow, Linda, said he
was concerned about the num-
ber of dead dolphins that have
washed ashore since early July.

Dolphin data:
Strength, sonar

Blindfold a dolphin and he’ll
ﬁnd you anyway with his excel-
lent sonar — so good he can tell
if a woman is pregnant, be-
cause he detects two heartbeats
instead of one. Some other facts
on the playful creatures:

I Dolphins — generally 400
to 500 pounds, 8 feet long —— can
make startling leaps. They’re so
strong that “all it takes is a cou-
ple of pumps in their tail and
they’re 20 feet in the air. To
them it’s play,” says Joan
Caron, director of training at
the Miami Seaquarium, home
to 20 dolphins. Scenes for the
19605 TV show Flipper were
ﬁlmed there.

IThere are 22 species . of
dolphins around the world.

I A dolphin lives as long as
40 years

IA dolphin eats from 25 to
30 pounds of ﬁsh a day.

I Mammals like us, they
have strong lungs — typically
coming up for air three times a
minute, but able to stay below
for ﬁve minutes at a time.

Known as playful animals,
they’re believed to be highly in-
telligent, but no one really
knows how smart they are. As
Caron says, “There’s really no
intelligence test that you can go
out and give them.”

Southern Arizona Bureau

ARIVACA —— The baby javelina,
its umbilical cord still dangling, was
trembling beside the road when
Tony Stanley rounded a curve on
his‘way into this remote southern
Arizona community one day in
January:

Stanley said he did not think
twice about stopping to pick up the
javelina, an obviously sick newborn
that probably had lost its mother to
a hunter. He eventually took the
baby to his isolated home in the

hills east of Arivaca, where he.

1 iursed it back to health.

It was an act of compassion,
something he had to do, Stanley

said.
'n'A month later, just after dawn
Feb. 23, Stanley learned that he was
dlead wrong about that act being a
good deed.

; The lesson came in the form of

Ii 2 'officers from the state Game and ,
Fish Department and Department

of Public Safety who, guns in their
hands, stormed Stanley’s isolated

house to seize the javelina. - .

. Those officers, Stanley said,j‘-
handcuffed him, threw him to the '

ground and ransacked his home and

the neighboring home of his:
mother, Byrd Baylor, an award- ‘

winning author of about 30 chil-
dren’s novels. . -

The raid has left Stanley, 38, who

said he occasionally works as a

miner and a bricklayer, out $120,

after pleading no contest to a
charge of illegal possession of live
wildlife. 3'

z‘ona for the Game and Fish
Department, defended the dawn
raid and said it'was “absolutely
not” an overreaction or an abuse of
authority. ‘

His boss, however, Temple Reyn- ,

olds, the new director of the
department, said that if the officers
conducted the raid only to serve a
search warrant for a baby javelina,

’ it was an overreaction.

,o o o -

In the early morning of Feb. 23,
Stanley: clad only in a pair of
Levi’s, walked out of his house and

‘ into the brisk morning air with
Peaches, as he had named the baby
javelina, at his heel.

As Stanley recalled it last week, V

his dogs were yapping more than
usual and he heard the sound of
vehicles breaking the normal silende
around his home.

Stanley said he figured the
vehicles belonged to hunters. Just
at that moment, as Peaches nuzzled
his legs, several four-wheel-drive

vehicles raced down his bumpy dirt.

driveway toward him.

Other vehicles appeared below
him inthe big wash that cuts beside
his and his mother’s adjoining
property. The vehicles skidded to a
stop, and men poured out of them,
racing toward Stanley and the baby
javelina.
, All of the men had weapons in
their hands, a mixture of rifles,
shotguns and pistols, aimed at him,

The department’s Perry said
such warrants are routine when his
department wants to seize pro-
tected animals held illegally.

Perry, who participated in the
raid on Stanley’s house, said he has
used the warrants to seize protected
rattlesnakes, bears, bobcats, deer
and several other types of wildlife.

Department procedures call for
using three officers for each build—

Because of Mikesell’s report of
Stanley’s threatening to kill the
javelina if there was an attempt to
seize it, Perry said, a decision was
made to rush Stanley’s house and
the other buildings “as early as
possible in the morning so we would
have surprise.”

Perry also acknowledged that
most of the officers in the raid had
their weapons in their hands.

“Obviously, anytime you serve a
search warrant, there is a lot of
concern for officer safety, especially
when” there was a reported threat
to kill the javelina, Perry said.

Stanley and his mother, Baylor,

The two met in 1974 at a Scbutz-
hund class Hoelcher taught. At
first, Little loathed Hoelcher’s

friend bitching about him. He didn’t
praise the dogs enough.”

She stopped going to class.

But she returned, to Hoelcher’s 4

it,” Little says.

Shady eventually became a na- 3
tional champ, and Hoelcher and
Little eventually became partners.
They moved in together, bought a F
kennel. Last year, they got mar-

ried. ‘

“We probably complement each
other in what we do more than any
two other people,” Hoelcher says.

them as weapons as much as pets.
The registered dogs—the Am.
Staff, the roman—nosed Bull terrier,
the little Staffordshire Bull terrier
of the AKC and the American Pit
Bull Terrier of the UKC—are al-
ways speciﬁed in laws attempting
to control dangerous pit bulls,
which fall into no deﬁnable catego-

ryThus thousands of well-behaved
family pets are in danger of being
outlawed, even though not one of
the recent deadly dog attacks has
been attributed to a registered dog,
according to the AKC and UKC.

There are a lot more American
Pit Bulls around than Am Staffs——

the UKC registers 25,000 to
30,000 a year. The AKC, on the
other hand, registers only 1,100
Am Staffs annually. The Am Staff
breeders insist that their dogs are *
more carefully bred for tem-.
perament; yet now they are in dan—
ger of extinction.

All evidence indicates that most
purebred animals of these varieties
are model citizens, and thatthe
havoc has been caused by pit bulls
either sloppily or haphazardly .
bred—or skillfully bred and trained
for meanness outside the dog es—
tablishment. ‘

“The people today who own .-
dogs that bite, want dogs that
bite,” says Brown. “It’s that Simple.
They buy a puppy for $50 and
proceed to starve and tortureit. .
They put it a cage and poke it With
sticks. They feed it hot peppers
and gunpowder because they’ve
heard that makes it mean. They re-
peatedly slap the puppyin the face
with a burlap bag containing a
kitten. Then they’ll rip open the
bag and let the dog kill the .kitten.

“They think they’re creating
ﬁghting dogs, but they’rereally cre-
ating fear-biters and crazres.”

As early as 1870, an English dog
resulting from the crossing of a
bulldog and a terrier found its way
into America’s heart. Known to
succeeding generations by various
names—the Bull and Terrier dog,
the Half and Half, the Pit dog, the
Yankee terrier, or the Pit Bull ter-
rier—the dog was in its heyday.

In 1980, however, pit bulls sud-
denly became a renegade macho
symbol. Fast—buck artists started

mating unstable dogs in back alleys -

and selling pups to ghetto kids,
motorcycle gangs and drug
pushers. Illegal high-stakes dog
ﬁghts moved from rural areas to

the cities. People gradually became '

' aware of pit bull viciousness. They

have been blamed for 21 of the 29
fatal dog attacks on humans srnce 3

1983, including 14 children under
6

they have caused, the Humane So-

ciety of the United States warns 1.
that the lack of accurate national ‘ '

d

‘ records and confusion over the .

label pit bull make it impossible to

.Despite such horrifying statistics .. .
and the national climate of hysteria .

prove' that these dogs—-——as a
group—pose any more of a threat

than any other breed.

Widespread disagreement exists

. about the deﬁnition of a pit bull.

These days, any sturdy, mastiff-
type dog seems to qualify, regard:
less of parentage..Pit bulls come in
all colors, stand anywhere from 12
to 24 inches tall at the shoulders,
and weigh 25 to 100 pounds. That

covers a lot of dogs.

Experts say that dogs bite a mil— \

lion Americans a year, but until
i' this summer were not much, of an

. £4 .

. '8 issue. Experts argue that many

other breeds have been responsible
for fatal human attacks. A 1982 re—
port, for instance, listed 16 breeds
that had killed 73 people. Pit bulls
were blamed for six of those
deaths, the same number as Great
Danes. Other investigations of hun-
dreds of dog bites have found that
p30 bulls were responsible for 7 in

Despite this, dozens of commu-
nities in such states as California,
Florida, Ohio, Kansas and New
Mexico have passed laws declaring
an pit bulls inherently dangerous
and specifying mandatory controls,
_or banning them altogether.

Several of the laws already have
been overturned. Courts tradition- '
ally have ruled that such breed—spe-
Ciﬁc ordinances are unenforceable
for a host of reasons, including
vagueness—it is scientiﬁcally im-

' possible to identify any breed of

dog. Pedigrees and dog registries
are the only way of reliably estab-
lishing breed.

Even among devotees, breeders
furiously argue whether the AKC
Am Staff is the-same thing as the
UKC’s American Pit Bull terrier,
although everyone acknowledges
that the AKC dog is an outgrowth
of the UKC dog. The modern
UKC condemns dog ﬁghting and

‘ expels any member who is charged

at even having been present at a
ﬁght. But it wasn’t aways thus.

It was as a ﬁghting dog that the
popular American Pit Bull terrier ’
formally was registered by the
UKC in 1898. A breed standard ,
was created, and a set of rules writ—
ten to govern ﬁghts. Perhaps the
saddest thing about the dogs is that
their devotion has been so misused
by the humans who created them.

Ancient paintings and carvings
show that bulldogs that looked like
Am Staffs were used to hunt, large
game and, later, as dogs of war.
Another theory of origin states that
the bulldog was crossed with the
Qld English White terrier, now ex- .
tinct, to create a dog with the rug-
ged courage and tenacity of the ‘
bulldog and the natural spunk and
hunting skills of the terrier.

The resulting dogs displayed ‘a
character trait that was heightened
to an .unusual degree: unquestion-
ing Willingness to please their
masters. The masters often twisted 7
the trait into perversion.

In the 18th Century, bear baiting
and bull baiting, (outlawed by the
English parliament in 1835) were
popular sports, and the pitting of
pet dogs against each otherfor
money arose, especially among the
coal miners of Staffordshire. The
bull terrier, a reliable, protective
family dog, proved stalwart under
such stress. ‘ .

The willingness to serve their
master, or gameness as the old dog
ﬁghters called it, blazed so power-
fully in these dogs that it even
overcame the instinct for self—pres-
ervation. They would never back
down, no matter how seriously in-
jured, when told to ﬁght another
dog. They went to their death at
their masters’ bidding.

Gameness was the trait that dog
ﬁghters bred for. But gameness is
not the same thing as viciousness.

“Any dog can be made vicious,”
Brown says. “The dog ﬁghters—
and I’m not excusing them—didn’t

_want vicious dogs. Too much
money was at stake. In fact, they

, would not tolerate a dog that

turned on a human being. Such a

‘ dog was instantly killed. .H

“It’s total nonsense to think these
dogs bite today because they origi-
nally were bred to ﬁght. If any-
thing, logic dictates that they
would be less likely to do so, be-
cause they were bred speciﬁcally to
not be people—aggressive.”

If a dog is handled early in life,

. socialized and obedience-trained, it
~ will become accustumed to re—

: straint and discipline, as long as its
5 temperament is stable. Pit bull ad-
mirers knew this in the 19205 when
they petitioned the AKC, the estab—
lishment in dog circles, for reCogni-
tion of the breed.

The AKC, however, was not _
about to register any breed with pit
. in its name. The fanciers persisted,
and in 1935 the club created the
Staffordshire terrier (later changing

.: it to the Am Staff), opened a stud
book registry and set a demanding
standard for intelligence, stability,
gentleness and ability to interact
with other dogs.

At this point in their troubled -
history, Brown says, pit bulls
turned a comer and the AKC dogs
headed off in a new direction. They
were bred not to ﬁght, but to show,
to be family pets and to join the
community of other dogs.

Brown qualiﬁes as an expert, and
as anathema to the dog ﬁghters.
He drafted the 1983 Illinois law
making dog ﬁghting a felony. He

lobbies for tough laws to remove

‘ ~ all vicious dogs from the streets
and to prosecute their owners. He
testiﬁes before lawmakers and has
worked for enactment of a pro-
posed Chicago ordinance—a law
modeled on the new Rhode Island

law that makes owners of any vi-

cious dog Carry $100,000 in liabili-

ty insurance and permits conﬁsca-
tion of any dog involved in an

unprovoked attack.

Brown exhibits his dogs in AKC

‘ conformation shows and teaches
weekly obedience classes. He adver-
tises his kennel, even though he has
no puppies to sell. His phone rings
constantly. .

Yet for every caller seeking infor»
mation about Am Staffs, ﬁve call-
ers want pit bulls.

“I’m after a ba-ad dog, man,” a
caller tells Brown. “For protection,
y’know. A guard dog.”

“What you really want,” says
Brown, wearily, “is a pig.”

“A Dig?”

“Sure. A pig is tough, smart and
mean as hell. Put a pig in your
house. Nobody will come in.”

Click.

Among the damaging myths sur—
rounding pit bulls is that their jaws
are the most powerful of any dog.
Such frightening ﬁgures appear—-
that they generate thousands of
pounds of pressure per square inch
when they bite—that you would
‘ think they were hyenas, not dogs.

“There is no scientific evidence
whatsoever behind the supposed
awesome biting power of the pit
bul ,” says Andy Johnson a spokes-
man for the UKC. “It never has
been substantiated anywhere by
any testing laboratory. On the con- '
trary, examinations of their skulls
and jawbones have shown nothing
different from any other dog of
comparable size.” .

“These dogs have been around

for 100 years, and they haven’t just '

suddenly started biting people in
the last six months. We believe that
. it makes good press whenever a pit
; bull gets in trouble. If these dogs
have been around for so long, how
much of this crisis is selective re-
porting?” .

Last year, more than 1.5 million"

dogs were exhibited at 5,000 all«

. breed shows regulated by the AKC.

, Of these, 76 animals were disquali— »
ﬁed for biting—not a lar e num-
ber. None were Am Sta s or the
related and less numerous AKC
registered breeds, Bull terriers and
Staffordshire bull terriers.

Chicagoan Louis Auslander, a
busmess executive and dog hobby-
ist who serves as chairman of the
' board of the AKC, has learned
overthe years to be cautious when
judging some breeds.

“But I’ll never hesitate to put my
hands on these three,” Auslander
declares. “The breeders have done
an outstanding job over many
years of careful work. They have
bred for reliable temperament and
created outstanding animals.”

Auslander is not surprised that
these dogs haven’t been causing
trouble, though he hastens to add:
“Registration doesn’t matter when
, someone is killed or hurt by a dog.
And right now there is an epidemic
of attacks.

“Despite the current notoriety of
pit bulls, however, they’re really no
more notorious than other breeds.

, Moreover, if society outlaWed any.“
thing resembling a pit bull, the
people who. misuse dogs would
soon be training airedales or

‘ Rottweilers to be ‘vicious. Such
people Will be deterred only by leg-
islation against all vicious dogs.”

Am Staff breeders such as Jim

Brown and his wife, Carolyn, have
always lived with the cloud that
hangs over the history of the breed
they love. Each new sickening pit
bull attack forces them to relive the:
very nightmare they have worked
so hard to avoid.

The Browns have spent a fortune

“And every one went to mimetic
I can trust,” he says. “Otherwise,
I’m just too afraid of what may
happen to them if they leave me.
There are too many nuts out there.
In each of the three AKC breeds, .
responsible people are terriﬁed.
Many of us have stopped
breeding.”

Something else has been tor-

turing Brown, something that tends .

to get lost in the current uproar.
“It sounds strange,” he says, al-
most apologetically, “especially
since I’m supposed to be a tough
guy, I’m a police sergeant . . .”

Then he hands you a newspaper
clipping from Ventura, Calif. It
tells of a woman who was bitten,
not seriously, when she walked past
a pit bull terrier that had been
abandoned. '

Animal control officers found the
dog. It was beside a tree next to a
half-sack of dog food, a 24—inch
rubber hose and a yellow rope that
had been gnawed in half.

Next to the dog was a sign:

“Hello, my name is Patches. I
haven’t 'got an owner. Would you
be mine?'I don’t eat much and I
don’t take up much room. I need a
lot of TLC. I’m a great watch dog,
and once I get used to you, I’m
real nice. But until then, just beat
me with this rubber hose.”

When officers picked up the
hose, the dog laid down and rolled ~
over on its back in submission.

As Brown watches you read,
there are tears in his eyes. .

, country?” he asks. . 7,

Threats along the way

Most of the sea turtles nesting on Florida beach-
es are Ioggerhead or green turtles. Loggerheads
are designated as a threatened species, and the _
green turtles are considered endangered. Both
face threats from nature and man.

Man is‘the sea'turtles’
biggest enemy. But some
people are trying to save
them from extinction.

By HUGH MARTIN
Tribune Staff Writer

MELBOURNE BEACH -— Clouds
hide the ’waning moon, and the
beach below the dunes is black
when she crawls out of the surf to
pull herself laboriously up the
sandy slope.

Her shell is salty with the smell
of the sea as she stops and begins
digging.

A darkened house tops the bluff
a few yards away, but the logger-
head turtle ignores human interlop-
ers on the strip of sand where her

May through August to lay-their
eggs quietly on the edge of the At-
lantic Ocean. I ' i.

There are victories to be won;
subtle battles to be fought here .in
the struggle to save the turtle from

extinction. But she knows nothing of

such matters as she follows the an-
cient instincts that tell her to settle
her 3%-foot—long shell into the sand.

The moon emerges from the
clouds as dozens of translucent
white eggs, resembling nothing so
much as pingpong balls, drop into
the bulb-shaped pit scooped out by
her rear flippers. Waves thump the
sand in a counterpoint to the deep
sighs of the turtle’s breath.

After the last egg drops, the tur-
tle's flippers deftly fill the pit with

pounds tamps down the sand.

Slowly, the turtle carves a half-'
circle in the beach as her front flip-

pers throw sand over the nest to
conceal it from predators.

Then the loggerhead, turns,
drags herself back down the slope
and slips into the sea.

- Almost two months will pass be-
fore 2-inch hatchlings emerge from
the turtle’s eggs and make their way
to within inches of the surface, wait-
ing for the cooling sand that signals
nightfall. Popular myth has it that
the hatchlings. will find the ocean by
following moonlight. " 7

But scientists note that hatch-
lings can find the sea on cloudy or
moonless nights, indicating that
they probably sense the difference
between the blackened dunes. and
the lighter water. - ‘

Researchers say only one in ev-

ery 1,000 to 10,000 of the bite-size

hatchlings survives the swim to the
open sea, eventually growing large
and maneuverable enough to es-
cape all predators except killer
whales and the largest sharks.

0 o o

Humans are the only enemy ca-
pable of killing sea turtles in large
enough numbers to create the
threat of extinction, scientists say.

In some respects, this lZ-mile
stretch of sparsely populated
Brevard County beach represents a
model for efforts to preserve the
once-abundant turtles now protect-
ed by state and federal endan-
gered-species laws. Sea turtles dug
about 31,000 nests in Florida last
year, and roughly a third of them
were here.

. Conservationists consider a 1985
Brevard law that effectively dark-
ened the beach by restricting lights
from shining on it to be a model for
other areas where sea turtles nest.

. Lights shining on the beach con-
fuse the hatchlings, robbing them of
precious energy needed for a fran-
tic 24-hour swim through predator-
infested waters close to shore, or
drawing them so far in the wrong
direction that they never reach the
sea, researchers say.

Scientists attracted to this rich
nesting ground are taking some of
the first, halting steps toward filling
the vast gaps in knowledge about
these ancient animals. But one thing
they are learning is that other,

time-honored conservation .practicj

es may be ineffective.
Each year, volunteers and re-

: searchers with special permits
‘ throughout Florida dig up thousands
of eggs threatened by predators or.

high tides. Incubating the eggs is

‘ relatively simple -— it can be done

in a cooler on a back porch.

But researchers now suspect
that artificial incubation may alter
the natural balance between male
and female turtles. And the com-

' mon practice of releasing the hatch-

lings during the day is a serious
mistake, the scientists say.
University of Central Florida zo-
ology professor Lew Ehrhart, a re-
spected authority on sea turtles,
says laboratory experiments indi-
cate that the turtles’ sex is deter-
mined by incubation temperature, a
common occurence among reptiles.
Cooler temperatures produce
males and higher temperatures pro-
duce females, according to Ehrhart.

'He is deeply tanned from his de-

cade-old nesting season routine of
renting a couple of small apart-
ments near the beach and cram-
ming them full of equipment and
students to study turtles.

Some biologists are still uncer-
tain about the effects of’tempera-
ture on sex — the state Department
of Natural Resources is‘studying the
question at Clearwater’s Marine Sci-
ence Center — but Ehrhart says ar-
tificial incubation might .disturb the
natural balance between males and
females. '

Mature females come ashore to
lay eggs several times every two or
three years. But they mate only
once during a nesting season, stor-
ing sperm in their bodies to fertilize
each new clutch of eggs, he says.

Artificial incubation of eggs
might reduce the number of fe-
males, eventually reducing the size
of the turtle population, he says.

' Ehrhart also questions the effec-
tiveness of incubating a few hun-
dred eggs at a time.

He says the emphasis should be
on preserving entire beaches, such
as this one where more than 9,000
nests have been dug this season.

Artificially incubated hatchlings
frequently are featured in newspa-
per and television photographs
showing them entering the water
during daylight hours as admiring
beachgoers crowd the surf to watch.

Last summer, University of Illi-
nois zoology professor Mike Salmon
and graduate student Jeanette Wy-
neken used a boat to follow hatch-
lings released during the day.

' They discovered that the prac-

tice provides a free meal for surf

, sharks and other predators that

feed on thetiny turtles.

Salmon suspects that hatchlings
naturally enter the water at night --
except when a cooling rain signals
them to come up during the day-
time — because it is harder for
predators to see them in the dark.

“We hope nobody releases
hatchlings during the day” any-
more, Salmon says. “It’s pretty
damn grim for daytime releases.”

Pollution poses another threat to
hatchlings and young turtles.

Ehrhart is studying some green
turtles that live in the Indian River
for about six years after reaching
age 2. He is deeply disturbed by
large tumors some of the turtles de-
velop during their stay in the river.

The tumors can break open as
the turtles graze on grasses along
the river bottom, making them vul-
nerable to infection.

Tumors blind some turtles. Fish-
ing line tangles around the growths,
and when the turtle swims by a pil-
ing the line can catch the wood, re--
sulting in a drowning, Ehrhart says.

The tumors, caused by a virus,
appear in turtles with weakened im-
mune systems. The immune sys-
tems may be weakened by the
turtles’ exposure to pollution, Ehr-

hart says.

But not all the news is bad.

Laws protecting sea turtles have
almost eliminated the once-common
practice of slaughtering them for
food. But federal studies show more
than 11,000 turtles drown each year
after becoming entangled in shrimp
trawls in the South Atlantic and
Gulf of Mexico. ~

Ehrhart says he recently read a
study showing that hope for sea tur-
tles rests with juveniles who will not

mature enough to breed for more
than a dozen years. ’ -

The study shows that fluctua-
tions in the number of hatchlings
have relatively little effect on sur-
vival of the species when compared
with the deaths of juveniles or ma-
ture adults, he says.

Beginning Oct. 1, shrimpers
working off Cape Canaveral a few
miles to the north will have to use a
special device that allows turtles to
escape shrimp trawls uninjured.

By May of next year, federal
regulations will make the controver-
sial device standard equipment in
most areas of the Atlantic and the
Gulf where sea turtles are likely to
be encountered.

Shrimpers fear that the device
will reduce their catch despite
14,000 hours of testing that showed
any reduction is insignificant.

But refusal to use the device will .

" Volunteers help protect the

There are, however, a few problems with the volunteer

By HUGH MARTIN
Tribune Staff Writer

MELBOURNE BEACH -—-' This is the
time of year When Peter Bandre aban-
dons his work as a house painter to spend
his nights on the beaches watching dozens
of sea turtles crawl out of the surf to nest.

As founder of the Sea Turtle Preserva—
tion Society, Bandre’s time during nesting
season is consumed by his role as the
most visible local advocate of efforts to

-. protect the turtles.

State and federal endangered species
laws make it a crime for most people to
disturb or possess sea turtles or their
eggs. But the 30-year-old volunteer holds
one of about 170 special permits issued

by Florida’s Department of Natural Re-m
_ sources to people and organizations that

’ system: improper record-keeping and lack of training, one
expert acknowledges.

want to help conserve sea turtles.

Volunteers such as Bandre use a stan-
dard sea-turtle manual that instructs
them on such matters as how to move a
nest that is threatened by predators or
high tides.

Bandre, who moved to Florida to at-
tend college but changed his mind about
going to school, says the turtles have fas-

cinated him for years. His conservation .

efforts are supported widely by govern-
ment officials in Brevard County.

The society’s headquarters is a house
rented for $1 a year from the city of Mel-
bourne Beach. The Brevard County Com-
mission recently voted to recommend
that the sheriff lend Bandre a police ra-
dio to report sightings of poachers —— who
eat, or sell sea—turtle eggs —- digging up

.- nests along the beach. .

But even Bandre’s supporters some-
times disagree with him. .

Marine Patrol Maj. Robert Patterson
says Bandre and the volunteers working
with him are “a great help because they
spend a great deal of time on the beach-
es.” But Patterson says there is no evi-
dence to support Bandre’s {assertion that
poachers destroyed 12 nests in a month.

Patterson reports only three con-
firmed instances of poaching in the
Brevard area since the begining of the
nesting season last May. .
. Noting that several conservation
groups —— including university research-
ers -— work on area beaches, Patterson
says Bandre may be mistaking legal har-
vesting of nests for poaching.

Alan Huff, biological administrator in,

charge of Florida’s sea turtle program,
says he took anyone who wanted to join
the volunteer program when it started in
1979. At the time, there were not enough
state funds to pay for items such as sur-
veys of the 600 miles of coastline where

 

sea turtles nest, he says. - .

But Huff acknowledges that there are
problems with the volunteer system.
Some volunteers do not keep proper re-
cords or have sufficient training, he says.

Huff adds that he is increasing the '
amount of training. “We’re trying to catch
up with this monster we’ve created,” he

s.

Lew Ehrhart, a zoology professor at the
University of Central‘Florida who studies
sea turtles, praises the accomplishments
of volunteers. But he also suggests that
they could use a little more guidance.

Ehrhart proposes a requirement that
organizations‘such as Bandre’s have a
board of advisers made up of scientists
who are knowledgeable about sea turtles.

“I think when you’re dealing with a
threatened and endangered species it’s
logical to expect them (volunteers) to
have some oversight to answer to some
board of directors, just like any business-
man has to answer to his board of direc-’
tors,” Ehrhart says.

Animal rights activists ‘liberate’

The Washington Post

' .WASHINGTON - Animal rights
activists cut through a chain-link
fence, smashed several padlocks and
took 27 cats from an Agriculture
Department research facility in
Beltsville, Md, including 11 cats in-
fected with a parasitic disease that
is particularly dangerous if con-
tracted by pregnant women, depart-

:ment officials said Monday.

The disease, transmissible
through feline fecal matter, can
cause fetuses to contract an infec-
tion and later suffer blindness, men-
tal retardation and hydrocephalus
(brain inflammation), said Hubert

, Kelley, sPokesman for the depart-

——a .‘-. ..u_

' ment’s Agricultural Research Center .

in Beltsville.

A group calling itself the “Band
of Mercy” took responsibility for
the theft, asserting that the cats,
along with seven African miniature
pigs, were “liberated” from govern-
ment researchers who practiced

“animal abuse with no clinical
Significance.”

The intruders at the center off
Route 1 in northern Prince George’s
County spray-painted slogans on ex-
terior laboratory walls, including ‘
“Stop the Slaughter” and “Animal
Liberation,” and left behind poetry
and vegetarian recipes.

The People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, acting as
representatives for the Band of
Mercy, issued a statement saying
that the cats “were not scheduled to
be treated. Experimenters simply

homes.”

John McClung said. McClung said

fice of the inSpector general and the

however, no arrests had been made.

The theft occurred between 3:30

The cats infected with the para-
site were removed from the labora-

. 'Animal behaviorism’ specialty attracting

 

By Steve Sternberg

Science/Medicine Writer

 

A dog’s best friend may be his theraw‘

; pist.
, In fact, as many as 200 veterinarians
and psychologists now make their living by
peering'inside the minds of troubled pets.
The calling is becoming known as ani-
, mal behaviorism -— and there is eVen a

7 proposal to charter a new college for pet 7.
psychologists in the American Veterinary -‘

. Medical Association.

, The practitioners of pet psychology are °
the vanguard of a burgeoning new veteri-' .

nary specialty whose sanest patients swing

7 from trees, buck at the sight of a saddle-or .

l bark at the postman.-

Then there are the crazy ones. .Like ,

‘ Chuck and Judy -- two chimpanzees who
(once lived in the Virginia Zoological Park
. in Norfolk, Va. ' - -

For more than, one year -‘- 'andfat a _}

cost of $25,000 —- Judy has been committed
to an asylum called “Primarily Primates”
in San Antonio. Wallace Swett, the facility’s

director, says Judy, 13, isrecovering from p

. spouse abuse.

Chuck, who died of a heart attack soon 3

after arriving in San Antonio, was once a
pampered chimp who smoked Winstons at
dinner with “his owners. But he became al-
most human -— he beat Judy, screamed at
visitors and threw. anything in sight.‘A
weekend visit to the zoo suddenly seemed
like an episode of “The Honeymooners”
gone wild. ‘ '

Judy, terrified, spent much of her time
cowering in. corners, vacillating from manic
hysteria to depression. Now, Swett says,
Judy is “doing very well” and has become a
“surrogate mother” for other deranged
chimps. __ . ‘ .

And therapy often involves more than

simply by teaching the dog to assocrate the , .

sound with supper. The significance of the '
finding was enormous. Researchers found
they could change the dog’s unconscrous re-:

 

spouses using rewards and repeti- .
tive behavior. , .

Pet psychotherapists now use
both Pavlovian methods and varia-
tions on them. Instead of automati-
cally rewarding a dog for a desired
behavior, the researcher rewards
the animal occasionally. The dog
then consciously tries to earn a re-
ward by behaving differently.

Sometimes, behavioral therapy
alone is enough to turn a rough-and-
ready hound into a lap dog, thera-
pists say.

Mary Lee, of Atlanta, says a
few simple techniques helped turn
Precious, her soft-coated Wheaten
telrrier, from a savage little nipper

' to a benign puppy.

t Dr. Crowell-Davis diagnosed
Precious as having “play aggres-

' any kind or harsh physical punish-

Precious would start biting, we
would tell her ‘no bite’ and then put
her in the bathroom for five min- .
utes,” said Mrs. Lee. ; ‘

_ “She was isolated. It didn’t take
long before she got the idea. It
stopped three days after‘ we fol-

lowed the instructions. that Dr.  =

Crowell-Davis gave us.”

Sometimes, if behavioral thera-
ay isn’t enough, therapists may turn

tranquilizers or other drugs.

Today’s behaviorists may pre
scribe female hormones for obses-
sive sprayers or aggressive males.
They say it beats castration, partic-
ularly for purebred pets who also
are valuable for breeding.

Dr. Crowell-Davis says a drug
called Nalaxone helped her cure a
madcap bull terrier of the “runner's

chasing his tail.

The drug blocked the actions of .
natural Opiates, which are a kind of
morphine produced by the body to
counter the pain of exertion.

As soon as the sensation faded,
Dr. Crowell-Davis says, the dog
stopped in his tracks.

“We just recently published that

' case as an example of a new treat-

ment for this behavior,” she said.
“Of course, I’m not sure it will
work in all cases -—-but it' worked
this once.”

The researcher believes the

AtTanta, GA. 30345

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for your Tetter and concern for our Taying hens. We join you in your
concern for raising them in a humane manner. We certainTy understand your position
and appreciate your time in writing.

Our egg industry is dedicated to providing consumers with a top quaTity product,

and this can be achieved onTy with heaTthy chickens. In 1982, egg producers

took the responsibie position of deveToping recommended guideTines of husbandry

practices for Taying chickens. The guideTines were based on animaT weifare considerations
from the Council for AgricuTturaT Science and Technoiogy and were provided to

the Humane Society of the United States. Our Georgia egg producer farmers have

adopted these guideTines of good husbandry practices. These inciude: housing

and equipment necessary to protect the heaTth and weTfare of their fTocks; the

necessary programs of sanitation, vaccination, and medication; and a nutritionaTTy- baianced
diet, pTenty of cTean water; and c1ean air for every chicken.

The environment of the egg producing chicken is simiiar to the conditions experienced
during the Spring season of the year. Temperature is reguTated with a mean average
of 70 degrees F. ; reTative humidity is reguTated with a median of 75%; ventiTation

is ideaTTy set at one cubic foot per bird per hour; and the dayiength is monitored
for approximateiy 14 hours of Tight and 10 hours of darkness each day.

Eggs packed in Georgia are produced by hens that are housed in a comfortabie
environment with their weTfare guaranteed through good animaT husbandry practices.
Hopefuiiy now, you can once again enjoy Georgia eggs -- one of nature's most
. nearTy perfect foods -- and severaT of our most recent recipes are enclosed.

Once again, thank you for your concern.

ST. LOUIS POST4DISPATCH - August 22, 1987

Bachelor Gorillas Will Hang OutAt Z

By Virginia Hick
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff
The St. Louis 200 is starting a
swinging bachelor pad for young
male gorillas. Leonel, the first resi-
dent, arrived this week from the
Los Angeles 200. .
Leonel and eventually three or
four of his pals will occupy the in-
door exhibition area of the Jungle
of the Apes. At 9, Leonel will be the
oldest of the group. The youngest is
expected to be 4 or 5. They are all
lowland gorillas -- an endangered
'species —— and all will come from
zoos. - . ,
The Zoo is making the bachelor
digs available as part of a research
project by the Gorilla SpeciesSur-
‘ vival Plan Committee. The commit-
tee is a national group that man-
ages “who breeds with whom and
when” among captive gorillas, said
Ingrid Porton, deputy curator of
primates.
. The all-male club will provide'a
holding place — a fraternity house,

'if you will -— for young gorillas
waiting for a family group of their
own. They are there to relax, to
have some healthy all-male fun and
to learn to be sociable.

Gorillas are born into and grow
up in a family group of one adult
male, several unrelated adult fe-
males and their offspring. In the

animals.” '
Porton said 597 lowland gorillas

. j lived in captivity in the world. Sci-

entists lack census information
about the number of them in the
wild. The total wild population of
mountain gorillas —— an even more
endangered species — is estimated
at around 400, Porton said.

The Zoo made room for the
bachelor buddies by moving an es-
tablished gorilla family out of the
indoor exhibition area to an out-
door enclosure. No remodeling will
be necessary. The Jungle of the
Apes, which opened in June 1986, is
the newest of the Zoo’s exhibits.

Porton said the family had yet to
adjust to the move. Several family
members kept trying to get out of
the summer heat by staying in the
nighttime quarters. '

At night, both gorilla groups will
eat and sleep in a series of “spa-
cious cages” that allow contact
within, but not between, the grotrps,

Porton said. The young males will

be able to see, hear and smell the
females in their nighttime quarters.
But these gorillas will not have
physical contact with the females.

200 personnel plan to watch the
bachelors carefully, to see if the
presence of females causes the
young males to pick fights. A sec-
ond zoo in the project will have a
male group without females pre-
sent, so data can be compared.

“There’s a large likelihood that
they won’t fight,” Porton said.
“About the only time gorillas fight
is when a maturing male wants to
take over a troop. And he’s not of-
ten successful; most of the time he
forms a troop with females his
age.”

Gorillas have a low reproductive
rate in captivity, Porton said. Re-
search has determined that they do
not do well in pairs, she said. The
committee hepes that by allowing
gorillas to live all their lives in so«
cial groups the animals will be bet-

ter able to repopulate the species.

 

wild, when gorillas -— both males
and female — reach maturity, they »
leave the group in which they were
born and eventually join or form
another group to raise a family. In
the interim between families, goril-
las may hang out with their peers
-— a group of the same sex and age.
“If you figure that you will have
about an even number of males and
females born, and you only need
one male per family group, then
you’re going to have a surplus of
males,” Porton said. “It’s better to
house extra males socially, so they
can have companions and remain
in the captive population for when ,
they’re needed as breeding .;

As general curator at Miami’s Metro-
zoo, he knows the resident critters bet- '

high school graduating class. ,

He knows their favorite snacks and
when they are under the weather. He
knows which ones will thrive in the sub-
tropical Miami climate and which ones
won’t make it. . -'

Being general curator means Zeigler
is in charge of the 200’s 1,300 birds,
mammals and reptiles. He determines
what they eat and if they will eat some-
thing different, where they live and
even if they will follow their innermost,
primitive drive - to reproduce.

“I. guess in a sense I was lucky,”

. Phillip Allen, then Crandon’s

decade.

son he became a general curator ,

rather than specializing in mam-
mals or birds, he once said, was

“because that way I could play .

L'Sigh. Zeigler thumbs through a
capital improvements budget on
the desk in his modest office, a
room with a view of the parking lot
and two wall shelves groaning with
books.

;...5‘The irony is that the further you
go in the zoo world, the further you
get away from the animals,”
Zeigler says, sc00ping up his re-
ports into an impressive stack. “It’s
kind of sad. At least 20 percent of
my, time now is spent on the tele-
phone!’

from Ramar the Gorilla’s inability ;
to mate (the press labeled him a
“sexual failure” before he was sent

back to North Carolina indisgrace)
to the arrival of baby Maja, the re- 1
, sult of some monkeying around .

among the lowland gorillas.

But behind the jokes is one of the ,
most serious aspects of Zeigler’s
job. For a species to survive, 1t
must reproduce. But if it repro—
duces within the confines of one 5;
zoo, genetic abnormalities W111}

crop up due to inbreeding.

So curators try to fool Mother
Nature by encouraging liberal VlSl-
tation policies. Animals are shut- 1.
' tled around the country, given tem-
porary homes in hopes that a
vacation might result in offsprmgs. ‘
After three years of disappomtmg a
performances by Mohan, the male ;
Indian rhinoceros, Zeigler packed ‘_
Shanti, his mate, off to the Philade- 3
phia Zoo for a summer. A pleasant .

stay could mean a valuable rhino
calf for Metrozoo 14 months later.
' This matchmaking has a name:
species survival planning. And '1‘:
has become an international affair.

As an active member of the
American Association of Zoologi-
cal Parks and Aquariums, Zeigler
has made several visits overseas,
encouraging foreign zoos and Wild-

life parks to repopulate endan— .

gered species. He just returned

from Indonesia and Malaysia, '.
where he and other Amencan zool- .

ogists are deveIOping breeding pro-
grams for the Sumatran rhinos and

Komodo monitors, the “dragon” 5
lizards that can hunt down water ,

buffaloes.

He is excited about both projects, 9

excited enough to tack a large map

of Semenanjung-Malaysia on his
wall. “Komodos are conmdered na-g

considers the effort worthwhile.
More than a scientist ‘or a manager,
helikestothinkofhimselfasacon-
servationist. ‘ ' , ’ _

“Zoos should be the arks, so to .
speak, for our animals,” he says.
“While we’re ﬂoating out here in
despair, we can keep them safe un-
til we can come up with a way to

. release at least some of them back
into the environment.” ,

It bothers him that stewardship
isn’t too widely accepted among his
own species. In Malaysia, shop
owners would stare blankly when
Zeigler pointed out that the stuffed
crocodiles in their windows were
endangered False Gavials. At a
back-lot pen in Metrozoo, a nest of
these crocs is being tenderly incu-
bated. ' >

“Bill has a most sincere interest.
in wildlife,” says Tom Foose, the

' American Association of Zoologi-
cal Park’s conservation coordina-
tor, who has known Zeigler for 10
years. “He’s exceptional in that he
has a very broad base of knowl-
edge. It’s rare to locate someone
who knows as much about herps
[reptiles] as he does about mam-
mals.” _, . '

I , .

Living with a zoologist can be a

little like rooming with Dr. Doolit-
e. _ .

“We leave a zoo and go home to a
zoo,” says Cynthia Zeigler, a bird of
prey specialist and the Dade Coun-
ty Zoological Society’s assistant di-
rector, as well as Bill’s wife. The
personal collection in their Home
stead residence includes two dogs'
and numerous birds. > ~

But it is the injured raptors Cyn-
thia occasionally tends at home

that underscore the differences in

the Zeigler philosophy. “Bill is
more logical,” she says. “I’m more
emotional. If a bird comes in that’s

at the Texas 200

also to the affairs of
the city, the state,

tors of noble organi-

.1 judge donkey beauty contests

Not just any contest, mind you.
I m talking about the Fourth Annu-
al South Texas Most Beautiful Bur-
ro competition held during the an-
nual Zoofest at the Texas Zoo in
Victoria.

Burros - actually most of them
were donkeys — from all over
South Texas came in for the con-
test. They were cordoned off in a
corner of the zoo grounds as their
Owners groomed them in prepara-
tion for the big momment

At the appointed time, the con-
. testants were walked around the
show ring in front of the judges’
table. There were four judges; [sat
next to a local beauty pageant win-
ner: “Queen Victoria.”

Each contestant was duly trotted
before the judges; the tally sheets
were studied and marked after
much consultation; the winners
were announced before the cheer-
ing crowd. The proud owners
brought them back to the judging
area for a triumphal parade.

1 So what does one look for in
judging a donkey -—- or its smaller
edition from the Southwestern
United States, the burro? This was
no mere parade of equine flesh.
Contestants were judged on “Pers
sonality,’ ’ and “Alignment,"a
well as general appearance. .

ln addition to Most Beautiful, we
gave trophies for “Best Dressed”
-— the winner here was outfitted in
a Madonna—like get-up with deli-
cate lacy socks on it forefeet —
and for, rather tellingly, “Most Ob-
stinate.”

Donkeys (Equus asinus) are re—
nowned for their stubborness,
which has probably been misun-

derstood for lack of intelligence. I ‘_‘
suspect the unfortunate phrase
“dumb animal” has been applied

to the donkey and its kin more so
than to any other animal.

,L- in.

Onkeys have played;

V a valuable role 1n earlier cultures Of

Africa and Asia as pack animals

.and work animals. Some of the

most memorable scenes from the
Bible, such as the search for the inn
at the nativity or the entrance to
Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, por-
trayed the riding of an ass. The
donkey was first domesticated
about 5,000 years ago from its an-
cestor, the African wild ass.

This wild ass, also called the true
wild ass, once roamed freely over
the desert plains 0f northern Africa.
The several species of Asiatic wild
ass occurred in desert regions from
the Near East over to Tibet and

..Mongolia. Today these wild

equines are greatly reduced in
numbers from hunting, persecu-
91.1,,1terMeem; with domestic

 

1. "istock and loss of habitat; all are

E. seriously endangered. (While the
African ass is considered the true

: ass, it is interesting to note that the
Asiatic ass is also called the half-
ass).

Of all equines, the donkey in its
many varieties is the most rugged,

l and therein has lain its usefulness
1to man It can go for longer periods

without water than any other horse
species, can better endure harsh
weather and can subsist on sparse
and poor quality forage. Although
donkeys and mules are the slowest
of foot of all the equines, they can
live and thrive where horses can-
not.

, Today donkeys are often kept as

pets, as were the contestant don-
keys at the Texas Zoo. The winners

,_ were: Rita, a spotted ass, for Most
Obstinate; she didn’t even want to
get in the show ring. Suzy, another
spotted ass, for Best Dressed (Ma-
donna clone); Cookie, a friendly
little Sicilian donkey who likes va-
nilla wafers, for Most Congenial;
and the big winner, Henry, a clas-
sic donkey with rich dark brown

i coat with a white belly, for Most
Beautiful.

NATIONAL ENQUIRER - August 25, 1987

Pets are more important to the physical
and emotional well-being of men than wom-

en, experts reveal.
“Pets allow the kind of
physical contact that men
are deprived of in this
culture,” explained Uni-
versity of‘ Pennsylvania
pet expert Alan Beck.
“Men have always been
taught not to hug each other
or let their emotions out.
“However, it is considered
normal for women to hug
each other -- and they are
actually less vulnerable to
some of the health problems
associated with isolation.”
Beck, director of the uni-
versity’s Center for the In-
teraction of Animals and
Society added:
“Our own observations of
hundreds of people with
their pets during the past

 

touched or held or stroked
their pets — mostly dogs 1-—
more than women did.”

Added Dr. Danilo Ponce,
who is a professor of psy-
chiatry .at the University of
Hawaii: “Pets can be more
helpful for men than for

club, bowling league or re-
ligious or civic association. .-

“However, an older man
who develops a close rela-

Owners shower pricey items
on their Pampered pets. ..

It’s a dog’s life. A Cat’s, too, for that matter.

Pets have always shared the joys and sorrows at
their owners; today they share their life-styles
as well.

“Anything you can think of for a‘person;

you’ll find for your dog or cat,” says Donna

Eastman of Pet Dealer magazine in Elizabeth,

NJ. “We have ads for high-tech dog houses,

solar dog houses, fanCy Cat Clothing, doggie
booties, doggie socks with suspenders, grooming products that
blow your mind, pet caskets lined in real silk and real fur on pet
beds ” "

From gourmet foods at one end to basic plastic pooper-
sCoopers at the other, the AmeriCan pet industry generated $10
billion in 1985, according to the Pet Information Bureau in
Washington, DC. As for grooming, says director Jeffrey
Reynolds of the National Dog Groomers Association of America
in Clark, 9a., “1 Could probably say Close to $1 billion a year and
not be far off.” »

Matthew Napier, owner of Napier’s
Kennel Shop in Birmingham, says he
knows of “at least three weddings
where dogs were in the bridal party.
One was not only the groom’s best
friend, but best dog at his wedding.”

Napier Carries rhinestone Collars for
females as well as blaCk tie for the
males. “You must remember,” he says,
“that for some people, the dog is their
child.” And as their incomes swell — as
they scale the demographic heights as
yuppies and DINKs (Double-InCome-
No-Kids) — so do their pets’ standar
of living. '

Prada, an Italian leather Company, ;

recently introduced a colleCtion of alli-
gator and lizard Collars and leashes for
dogs. “We expect to receive them in
September,” says Charles Chilton,
manager of the Prada Milan shop in
Manhattan. “The priCe range will
probably be between $100 to $200.”
.No Custom designer line sounds
more exclusive however, than Haut
Dog’s, a new Florida mail order firm.
They’ve designed Neat Heat pants,
starting at $25 with prices Continuing
upto $300 for other outfits. There’s a
formal line of Dognasty wear, a linge-
rie ColleCtion, Yap of Luxury
cruisewear, BitCh and Famous Coats,
and maternity outfits labeled Heavy
Breeders. The Til Death Do Us Bark
wedding ensemble boasts a four-foot
train of Italian satin appliqued with
antique laCe and pearls, a netted head-

piece, sexy blue garter, a fetChing .

bouquet and a priCe tag of $300.
i The grooms’ tuxedo has a bib, studs,
bow tie and “Cummerbone.”

TWHILE SOME OWNERS may bark
at pet-wear priCes, the president of a
Detroit pet products Company Con-
tends they are reasonable “in relation
to other items.” ~

i“We pay $60 for our kids’ shoes,”
says Lawrence Herman of Herman
Brothers Sales Corp., “and on that
premise ' pet items are great deals.
People are as into spending on their
pets as they are on their children.”

. Pampered Children, for instanCe,
might eat choColate Chip Cookies at $4

per pound. Fortunate Fideaux get su- 3

garless, saltless home-baked dog

treats, Coskies, at $8.98 per pound.

Squirt, an 11-year-old Siamese-
/ Burmese Cat from Warren, Can take
his piCk of four sCratChing posts, even
though he has no Claws.

“He thinks he’s an ostriCh,” says
owner NanCy Meltzer, 48. “When he
deCides he wants to run and hide, he
jumps into this hole in the middle of his
horse and lies down.”

The horse stands “three or four feet
high,” she says, a foot or so taller than
Squirt’s ring-shaped post and a bit
shorter than his two-story Cat Condo.
Squirt owns “every toy on the raCk,”
many of them presented in‘ his Christ-
mas stoCkinE. .

Meltzer says, “but that’s OK.”

Terrib e terriers?

Not all pit bulls bullies, but all taking the heat

By Joni H. Blackman _
Denver Post Staff Writer
BROOM FI ELD —- Wherever he
goes, Punk wears sunglasses. l-lis
owner doesn’t want anyone to
know the dog is a pit bull terrier.
Colorado pit bull owners are in-
creasingly sensitive about telling
people that they own a dog now
widely believed to be vicious, but

that has been nothing but loving '

and loyal to them.

The dogs are suffering, too.
I Nationwide, dogs that even re-
' motely resemble pit bulls are be-
ing burned, hanged and shot.

Denver-area pit bull owners’

have been asked to get rid of
their dogs or vacate their apart-
ments. Pit bulls are unable to at-
tend local dog shows because
their owners can’t obtain insur-
ance. Children aren’t allowed to
play at friends’ homes if the fami-
ly owns a pit bull.

Pit bulls have killed all six peo-
. ple who died in US. dog attacks
this year. But defenders say that
doesn’t mean all strains of pit
bulls are dangerous

“’I‘ he gentle pit bulls come
from the American Staffordshire
terrier, which is picked for obedi-
ence and conformation. They can
be excellent dogs,” said Donald
Clifford, a veterinarian and pro~
lessor at the Medical College of
Ohio.

“Those aren’t the dogs causing
_ the trouble, but they’re getting
the heat. It’s the teenage kids’

Punk hides his identity.

junk dogs gotten from people who
breed them to fight that kill peo-
ple,” added Clifford, who is writ-
ing a book about pit bulls and dog-
ﬁghhng.

Punk is an obedience- trained
pit bull who is a frequent star at
Children’s Hospital and the flos-
pice of St. John’s. Wearing his
trademark sunglasses and a
clown outfit, he pushes a grocery
cart filled with puppies to visit
patients, said owner Pat Andrea-
son, president of the' Colorado
Dog Academy.

“One day at the hospice, we
visited a 24-year-old man who

 

was dying of AIDS. Punk jumped
in his bed, licked him and the
man gave him a big hug,” An-
dreason said. “He said it was the
first hug he’d had in months. A
week later, he was dead.”

Punk started wearing sun- L

glasses when pit bull publicity
proliferated.
“So we don’t scare people. . . .

That way, they come away from ‘

him with a smile and don’t recog-

nize his breed,” Andreason said.
But Andreason and others own-

ers of friendly pit bulls say they

suddenly are being discriminated

against

Andreason and Punk were in-
vited to a Children’s Museum pet
parade. Andreason declined be-
cause of a schedule conﬂict, but
was asked again and finally
agreed.

“When they found out I had a ‘

pit bull, they asked us not'to
come,’ Andreason said. “They
didn’t even meet the dog ”

Jack Holloway of Arvada, pres-
ident of the Colorado American
Pit Bull Terrier Breeder’ s Associ-
ation, can’t buy insurance for his
club, which sets up a classic
Catch-22: The public has been
told to fear pit bulls, but can 't
judge for themselves at pet
shows because pit bulls can’t get
insurance because peOple are
afraid of them.

Kathi Fortmann, owner of Ban-
bury Saddlery in Littleton, was
looking for a guard dog to protect

her during long solitary hours in
the shop. One trainer told her all
about a dog that sounded perfect,
until she asked what kind it was.

“He said a pit bull, and I said,
thanks a lot and almost hung up
the phone,” Fortmann said.

But she met Mox, with his
“funny face. ” He now spends his
days at the shop, greeting cus-
tomers and watching over Fort.
mann.

“People pet him, he licks them,
then they finally say, ‘what kind
is he?’ When I tell them, they say,
‘I thought they were supposed to
be mean.’

Recently Joy Cook’s daughter

.had a new friend over to her Au-
rora home several times. The lit- ‘

tle girl liked Cook’s pit bulls, B. J.
and Snow. Then one day she men-
tioned the dogs to her mother.

“The mother said she could
never again set foot inside here,
that my daughter could go there.
I offered to introduce the dogs to
her, but she refused,” said Cook.

The Denver-area incidents are
rathertame compared to recent
national events, said Randy Lock-
wood of the llumane Society of
the U. S.

He’s bad calls trom Family
Service departments, asking if a
day care provider wifeh pit bull
should have her license revoked.
Not if there are no complaints
about the dog, Lockwood told the
caller.

“The backlash is being felt by

ers," Lockwood said. “People are
afraid to walk the streets with
their dogs, worried of what their

neighbors will think. We’ve had
incidents of good dogs being shot, *

WESTBROOK, Conn.
ysterical righteous-
ness, fueling moves
to have pit bulls
banned, has created
an appalling situa~
tion, eerily remi-

‘ jniscent of the time in 1738,. in Edin- '

burgh, Scotland, when a dog - a sin-
gle dog — started a lot of dog fights at
. the Edinburgh Flesh Market. The
magistrate ordered that “all dogs of
' the mastiff kind be forthwith put to
death under penalty of £5 Sterling and
imprisonment of the owner for twelve
calendar months."
Following the judge’s order, there
was a bloodbath, with dogs of all
breeds, including lap dogs/slaugh-
tered, hanged, clubbed and driven
_ into the sea by the City Guard and
citizens. The next day, the Magistrate
of Leith ordered all dogs of the town
to be put to death. -
Thousands of pit bull owners are
frightened, not of their dogs, but of

unconstitutional legislation. Some of ‘

them are frightened enough to put
their pets into pounds, either because
they read the newspapers more de-
votedly than they read their dogs or
because they are afraid of threats to
make them carry punitive liability in-
surance.

There are no doubt “undesirable”
pit bull owners, but I hear from law-
Vicki Hearne, a writer and animal
trainer, owns two pit bulls.

 

\

yers, secretaries, factory workers
and others who are worried about
punitive legislation. I. also hear from
animal control officers who are upset
because they may be forced to kill
gentle, sound animals but don’t dare
speak against it because their bosses
are making political hay from the
situation. '

Some pit bull owners have shaved“
and tattooed heads and don’t write to
me, but neither the hairdo nor race of
an owner affects a dog’s tempera-
ment. Even being in a crack den
won’t corrupt a dog or cause it to mu-
tate into a weapon.

Prof. I. Lehr Brisbin, zoologist at
the University of Georgia, investi-
gates the nature of pit bulls, and his
testimony as an expert witness has
been accepted in cases successfully
appealing ordinances that name spe-
cific breeds. The cases succeed for a
number of reasons.

One is that there is no scientific evi-
dence that pit bulls bite more often or
more severely than other breeds.
There is also no evidence that fight-
ing prowess has anything at all to do
with aggression toward humans. Pit
bulls, like the other game breeds,
which include Airedales, Yorkshire
terriers and Cairn terriers, have
deep inhibitions against biting
humans. ,

Thus, despite the interest in pit
bulls as protection dogs, the careless
breeding of them and their popularity
as a candidate for attack training,
they do not lead in bite statistics.

In a study by Lake County, Ill., Ger-
man shepherds, Labrador retrievers,

“

_ Stop Intimidating ~
Pit Bulls and Owners

golden retrievers and mutts all bit
more frequently than pit bulls. In a
study of the severity of dog bites by
Palm Beach County, Fla., chow
chows, rottweilers, cocker spaniels,
German shepherds and Labrador re-
trievers all ranked higher.

But the issue of constitutional
rights is the central one. Some judges
are ruling thatordinances specifying
breeds allow law enforcement per—
sonnel too great a discretion -— since
it takes expertise to know any breed,
not just pit bulls - and unlawfully

subject owners to irreparable injury
in the form of imprisonment and de-
struction of their dogs. They are also
deciding that ordinances naming
breeds don’t protect the public in any
case.

One Ordinance, in Lynn, Mass,

which is under challenge in .the
courts, banned as “pit bulls" the
“American Staffordshire, Stafford-
shire pit bull terrier or bull terrier or
any mixture thereof." None of these
phrases name breeds. There is such a
thing as the American Staffordshire
terrier, and such a thing as the Staf-
fordshire bull terrier. The term “pit
bull” is a nickname of the American

.(pit) bull terrier.

Confusion about breeds is frequent.
In a Texas case there was a half-page
photograph of an animal control offi-
cer holding a dog described as a
“Captured Pit Bull,” above a news

  

  

story that had no facts in it but a lot of
adjectives such as “bloodthirsty.”
The dog in the photograph was a pug.

' Horror stories about breeding
abound, and tend to concern inbreed-
ing, which has been blamed for dumb
collies, snappish cooker spaniels, the
failure of the poor to speak standard
English and the eccentricities of the
English aristocracy. In fact, it isn’t

' inbreeding that ruins dogs but rather

greedy and careless breeding. Puppy
mills, for example, create unsound
animals, as do pet owners with little
or no knowledge of genetics but who
would like Sugar Blossom or Lulu to
have just one litter. “Backyard,” or
hobby, breeders are generally re
sponsible.

Breeding for a given trait takes
skill and commitment, especially
breeding for a trait such as man-hat-
ing, that is generally alien to the na-
ture of dogs. Breeding for fighting,
deplorable as fighting may be, is not
breeding for man-hating.

The traits of a pit bull that make it

4 a formidable fighter are not monster

traits. Their wiriness and spring, and
the ability of some to climb and to
play tug-of—war with trees, simply
represents physical soundness, and is
no more monstrous than the stamina
of the jockey Willie Shoemaker or the
speed and power of the horses he
rides.

As for “fighting to the death,” Pro-

. fessor Brisbin reports that pit bulls

have capillaries that are less likely to
close in response to trauma, so the
dogs do not go into shock. Their blood
sugar remains stable under stress.
Mine doesn’t, and that sometimes af-
fects my judgment, which is one rea-

son I like to have a second opinion_

from my dog. In any event, sound
capillaries are responsible for this so-
called killer trait. .

Of course, actual information about
dogs is not a matter of interest to
those who would have pit bulls

banned, and who in some cases are
beginning to expand the category “vi-
cious dog” to "include just about any'
dog alive. Randall Lockwood, for ex»
ample, a publicity official of the Hu-
mane Society of the United States,

'told Sports Illustrated that “a dog.

that lunges at its fence when someone
walks past” is,“a dangerous dog”,
This simply isn’t so. All dogs are pro-
tective of their property, and virtui
ally all dogs will bark from behind a
fence.

Mr. Lockwood argues that even
stiff vicious-dog laws are insufficient,‘
because under such laws 3 dog has to.-
actually bite someone before being
declared guilty. Mr. Lockwood said,
“The new thrust is to make owners
responsible for their dogs before
there's a problem.” '

The only legislative way to do this
is to empower government and law
enforcement agencies to decide»
whether a dog is vicious. This, like or-

” dinances specifying breeds, would

clearly violate owners’ rights - all
owners -—- by giving too much discres
tion to enforcement officers. ,
' It will continue to be not the govern-;
ment but private breeding and train-
ing clubs, and the free and open
competitions they sponsor, that will'
have any impact on canine citizen-.
ship. And the only kind of legislation
that can possibly improve breeding.
or training is protective, such as the,
laws' granting guide dogs access to
public areas, thus creating a powerful ‘
motivation to breed and train some
wonderful dogs. .
The kind of righteousness that
needs a monster to make noise about .
can be persistent and dangerous,
more dangerous than any dog can be.
The same impulse that wants to ban,
pit bulls seems to be firing moves to
imprison AIDS victims. The right-
eous horror story, on which human vi-
ciousness depends, is the danger. l l

 




r," Bald eagles have bred naturally
,in captivity, but rarely through ar-

tificial insemination, Ingram says.

3 Golden eagles have been bred arti-

; ficially, but he says the problem is

, different with bald eagles.

j “The bald eagle is a more soli-

tary bird," he says. “It doesn’t like

5' to be handled. It's much-more diffi-

cult to work with.”

Bald eagles, with wingspans up
to eight feet, are the nation’s sec-
ond-largest birds of prey, after the
California condor. '

Unlike many other wildlife spe-
cialists, Ingram shrugs off sugges-
tions that the bald eagle now ap-
pears to be making it on its own in
the wild.

“If a species reproduces at a
rate of 25 percent, its population
can increase. If it’s 20 percent, the
population will decrease,” he says.
“A few percentage points are the
difference between a population
holding its own, increasing or fall-
mg.”

Nevertheless, the bald eagle is
making a strong comeback since
the 19605 when such pesticides as
DDT impaired the ability of birds

to reproduce. Starting in 1972, most
i uses of DDT in the United States
were banned. _ _
,3 ’ In Alexandria, Va., Daniel
James, wildlife biologist in the Of-
‘; fice of Endangered Species of the
1 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
j says the 1987 count of nesting ea-
5 gles has not been completed but
that last year there were an esti-
mated 2,000 nesting pairs of bald
eagles in the contiguous 48 states.
From that it was concluded there
were 6,000 to 8,000 resident bald ea.
gles.

In addition, he says, there were
8,000 breeding pairs in Alaska, with
a total of 30,000 bald eagles in that
state. '

A National Audubon Society sur-
vey in the early 19603 concluded
that there were only. about 400
nesting pairs in the lower 48 states.

, Every state but Hawaii now has

-. ready-made foam molds used on
‘ most animals (the skins are re-
moved from the animal and ap-
plied to the mold) -— mounting a
household pet can be costly and
time-consuming. . ,

“It takes at least twice as long to
preserve a pet,” says Jim Vaughn,
who is currently working on three
dogs and three cats. “With wild ani-
mals, the form is already made.
There’s no personality. With pets,
you have to make a plaster mold
right over the body. You have to put
the ribs in, the veins in. Every part
of the body\except for the eyes is
the pet’s -— nails, nose, everything.
And everything has to be exactly
the same or the owner will immedi-
ately notice it.”

A That’s why it can take up to six
months to mount a pet, compared
to the more typieel two months for
“traditional” animals. Butthe
work must be started within hours
”after the animal dies.

“If you start at the right time,
there’s no bad smell —- it’s no
worse thanthe smell of a butcher
shop,” he says. “If you wait too
long, you just can’t do it.”

Prices start at $500 for a small“
cat and $1,800 for a large dog -
money well spent to grieving pet
owners.

. “A few people are a little besti-
' tant to accept what I did, especially
with Alpha standing right there by
my easy chair,” says Skurka, 40.
“Occasionally, they’ll say things
like ‘How can you do that?’ But
most of my friends think of it as a
great tribute to a great friend.

“Alpha was my best friend, and
when he died, I cried for days.
When I saw the beautiful work Jim
.Vaughn did on Alpha, I cried for an-
other two days. That’s because I

TAMPA TRIBUNE - August 10, 1987

'EDeath of rare white tiger cub I
also breeds hope at attraction

l

By KATHY FEENEY
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA — His birth was attend-

« ed by an amazed audience of tour-

ists who witnessed his arrival early
Friday evening.

But the first white Bengal tiger
born at Busch Gardens didn’t live
long enough for the theme park’s
zoo employees to name it.

'The l—pound, l3-ounce baby ti-
ger died Sunday at 12:02 am, said
Glenda Gilmore, Busch. Gardens
etlrtx manager. it :3. just short
of 31 hours after its birth.

Autopsy results indicate the ti-
ger suffered from a “twisted bow-
el,” a congenital deformity fairly

common to animals and people,

said Ron Reynolds, curator of small
mammals at Busch Gardens.

“When the baby was born, the
mother cleaned it up, then she

walked away from it. Mothers have -

a way of knowing when something
is wrong with their babies, and in

. the wild, she would have walked off
‘ and the baby would have been prey
9 to other animals,” Gilmore said.

“We stepped in to fix things -.— but
the mother knew all along that
something was wrong.”

The birth was witnessed by sev-
eral tourists who had stopped to ad-
mire the parents -— mother, Maya,
and father, Samsara — and their

neighbor, a yellow Bengal. From ,

the bridges overlooking Claw Island,
guests can watch the animals as
they swim in the moat, play With
each other and eat. Maya gave birth
to her baby in front of the surprised
guests, “who went running and
screaming after the attendants,”
said Gilmore.

Within a half-hour the baby Ben-
gal was placed in an incubator in
the small mammal nursery, said
Reynolds. Since other tigers have
been born at the park, zoo person-
nel were familiar with the type of
formula needed to feed the infant,
he said. '

Busch Gardens officials had an-
ticipated the birth 'of a white Ben-
gal, but because adult tigers weigh
nearly 400 pounds — and their full-
term babies are about the size of a

puppy —- pregnancy is difficult to

 

detect and zoo personnel did not
know for sure that Maya was preg-
nant, said Gilmore. _.
White Bengals are indigenous to
India and number only 100 world-
wide, according to Gilmore. She
said Maya and Samsara, both 6
years old, are among 60 white Ben-
gals living in the United States. The
animals were born at the Cincinnati
Zoo and have been at Busch Gar-
dens since 1982. '
Although zoo officials are disap-
pointed at the death of their first
(white Bengal, the birth did confirm
“that we have viable breeding
stock,” said Gilmore. Because the
yellow Bengal on Claw Island also
possesses white genes, she will be
bred with Samsara as well, Gilmore
said. -
Normal gestation for tigers is
about 90 to 105 days, “and since we
know the animals are capable of
breeding, we do anticipate other
(white Bengal) cubs,” said Reyn-
olds.
Gilmore said the baby tiger will'
be buried on the theme-park
grounds. '

LAUDERDALE SUN-SENTINEL - August 10, 1987

Tail up, nose held high, John
Henry was a dog on a mission.

-He trotted through the crush of
travelers, luggage carts and suit-
cases at Miami International Air-
port, zeroing in on a canvas carry-

for the US. Department of Agricul-
ture’s Beagle Brigade.

“I told you to leave that ham on
the plane,” a passenger scolded her
companion as USDA inspector Cal
Brannaka pulled the remains of a
sandwich from the bag. '

John Henry is one of six beagles
nationwide sniffing for meat,

lants, fruit and vegetables carried
into the country by overseas travel-
ers.

He recognizes 25 odors, including
banana, mango, grapefruit, thyme,
cactus, rice, wheat, sausage, turtle
eggs, corn, passion fruit and lemon.

In an hour one day last week, he
intercepted seven apples, a pear,
four oranges and the ham sand-
wich. The contraband came in with

ssengers on a British Airways

'ght and a Continental flight, both
from London.
._ One catch could save Florida
millions of dollars in damage from
stowaway insects and parasites
harmful to the state’s major craps.

“If African swine fever was in-_
troduced in Florida, the estimate is'
the first year [it] would cost us $10
billion to eradicate it,” Brannaka
said. “That’s just in Florida.” , ,

' Sometimes, the items are smug-'
gled intentionally, hidden in shoes,
wrapped in underwear, stuffed in
false bottoms in boxes.

Most often, however, the contra-
band is an apple carried to curb

hunger pangs during long flights, a

 

 

bonsai plant or foreign spice
brought as gifts.

John Henry proves daily that or-
dinary folks are smugglers. Almost
uniformly, when asked if they are
carrying fruit or meat, they say no.
Some are liars. Others are simply
naive.

Norman Locklear of Coconut
Creek looked nervous. He did not
declare on his US. Customs card
the orange and apple John Henry
found in his bag. ~

Failing to declare food items at
Customs can bring a $50 fine, Bran—
naka was saying.

 

“I didn’t know,” Locklear said.
“The president of the cruise lines
sent us this basket of fruit to our ho-
tel in London. I thought I’d eat it on
the plane.” ' . ,

To a chorus of “Oh, how cute!”
the dog—inspector team worked the

out to the dog.

HE FIRST OWLS showed up
four years ago. They were big,
beautiful birds with 4-foot wing-
spans. They sat in the oak trees
about 20 feet from Jeanne Borgetti’s
home.
Two years ago, the owls came in
closer. Now they were 10 feet away.
This summer, they really moved
in. Sometimes the owls are less than
5 feet from the family. They sit on
the picnic table. The mailbox. The
sun umbrella.

One swooped down 3 feet from

Jeanne’s teen-age son. That night,
be armed himself with a baseball
hat.

“The place is infested with owls,”
declared a friend.

“I’m scared to sit out alone in
my yard at night," Jeanne said. “I
won’t let my little dog out. She only
weighs 12 pounds. I’m afraid an owl
will carry her off.”

The small, gray dog has a hair-
raising problem. “I took Bubbles in

' for her summer trim and said,

“Don’t cut her too short. She looks
too much like a rat.’ ”
Jeanne lives in a subdivision just

"outside Fenton. She has the last

house, surrounded by woods.

“It’s quiet here,” she said. “For a
while, it was fun to sit out and watch
the owls. Until they started moving
in. They have claws THAT long.
Their wings make that soft, spooky

sound. Suddenly, I realize I’m all

alone.

“The owls start about dusk. The

later it is, the closer they get. I rare-
ly see more than three at a time, but
that’s enough.”

Jeanne says they are probably
barred owls. She found their‘picture
in a bird book —— a Who’s Who. The
birds haven’t read the book. It be-
gins, “This owl is seen only by those

who seek it out in its dark retreat.”

on the garage roof in the glare of
the outdoor lights.

“times, bikes, kids don’t really
botiwi them. My big dog ignores
theft: completely.”

Biti Jordan even shines flashlights
at‘the owls and talks to them, “real
soft. Just like you would to a dog.”

“You seldom hear them hoot,”
Bill said. “They whistle to each
other."

Biii can call the owls with a high-
pitched whistle. He gave me a dem-
onstration. No owls showed up that
night. He says they retreated to the
deep woods during the heat wave.
He also thinks they’ll return.

Jeanne is glad owls quiet on
the Western front.

“It was nice to sit outside Friday
night without them staring at you,”
she said. “Of course, I am the only
one in the neighborhood who’s nev-
er had a mouse in my house.

“I’d never hurt the owls. They’re

5neat. If I knew they weren’t going to

hurt me, I’d feel fine. But I just don’t
know.”

with the Missouri Conservation De-
partment, advised Jeanne to keep

machine,” Dave said. “There are
known instances where Great
Horned Owls carried off small dogs
or cats. If it’s the size of a rabbit,
then the dog may be in danger.”

Will‘they Carry off Jeanne?

No problem there, says Dave.
“I’ve never heard of any occurrence
with a barred owls.”

But the owls’ behavior is un-

usual. “Any wild animal can get'

used to people. These owls may
have gotten used to the family call-
ingthem.” '
Here’s the mystery: The owls talk
in whistles, instead of their usual
barred owl call: “Who cooks for‘
you? Who cooks for you all?” '
“Some birds, when young, pick up
a call that’s not part of their spe
cies,” Dave said. “I didn’t know
these owls from puberty, so I can’t
say. There are a lot of unanswered .
questions here. \
“If the famtiy will quit calling
them in, the hints may'go away. ‘

“They may be able to discourage

the owls with loud noises. They

" could bang, pots and pans. In ex-

treme cases, a small package of
firecrackers may keep them away.”

“I told her to quit feeding them

didn’t want to stop. She said, ‘I can

“ Representativestfrom several

A four-member steering commit-

coalition in January of this year
when the DeKalb County Commis-

other viable alternative is to go to
a responsible organization like the
Humane Society. Usually they
have observed the dogs they put
out for adoption and they know
their temperment,” said Ms.

“DENVER POST - August 9, 1987

Denver Post Staff Writer '
Irresponsible dog owners uni-

formly are choosing to own pit bull

year’s fatal dog attacks involved

pit bulls, a humane society official.

said Friday. .

Pit bull terriers aren’t the prob-
lem, said Randy Lockwood, an an i—
mal behaviorist with the Washing-
ton D.C.—based Humane Society «of
the US. Instead, he blamed weak
local animal control departments
and media concentration on sensa-
tional attacks, which encourages

_.“37,erks" to obtain pit bulls.

Statistics show that the number

of fatai dog attacks has stayed at

about it) each year, Lockwood :saidx

. But statistics on which breeds kill
most often periodically changes.
“What we’re seeing is a greater
uniformity in the choice of dogs by
irresponsible owners. And most fa-
tal attacks involve clear-cut owner
irresponsibility -- people seeking
to own dangerous dogs," Lock.
‘wood said. “Among them, the
choice is now the pit bull.” .
That can be blamed on the me-
.dia, Lockwood said.
“I think the media certainly has

Contributed. One of the disturbing .

things I‘ve seen for many years,
when there has been a highly publi-
crzed severe or fatal attack, de-

mand for such’animalrs goes up ‘

among people likely to be an irre-
sponsible owner.” . '

‘ The pit bull then becomes a pop
ular subject, and cases involving
pit bulls are publicized, while other
tragic cases are ignored.

Jack Holloway, Colorado Ameri-
can Pit Bull Terrier Breeder’s As-
sociation president, blames Den-
ver’s problems on a 1981-82 local
television documentary highlight-
ing the “ferocious” pit bull.

“Before that, animal control of-
ficers say they rarely saw a pit
bull. It got the wrong people into
the dogs,” Holloway said.

“The media attention about kill- 7

er pit bulls has caused people to ac-
tually call me. and say I’ve seen

 

é@Smean, killer pit bulls on television
'. and I’ve got a puppy here that all
:he wants to do is love people and

‘be loved. What’s wrong with '

him?”
Richard Stratton, a San Diego
author of several dog books in-

' eluding “This Is the American Pit
Bull Terrier,” said misconcep-
tions about the dogs began sever-
al years, ago when proponents of
dog-bite laws told horror stories
with pit bulls used as examples.

. “All that publicity helped make
them popular with the wrong peo-
ple. It has continued and snowbal-
led -— this has been a media

. event,” Stratton said.

‘Holy terrors, baby killers’

“People all over would play
. with our dogs and no one was
afraid. Until some articles were.

written. The dogs were made out ~

to be holy terrors, baby killers.

. Then scumbags started buying

the dogs because of what they
heard,” said former pit bull
. breeder Joy Cook of Aurora.

One percent of every breed
contains dogs with aggressive
personalities, said Broomfield
dog trainer Pat Andreason. Al-
though statistics aren’t kept by
breed on dog bites, Andreason
said news reports consistently as-

sociate violence with only one'

breed -— the pit bull.

“They’ve made the pit bull the
Rambo of dogs and now people
are seeking them out. . . . They

find an aggressive dog and do
things to encourage it to be vi-

- cious,” Andreason said.

One study of news stories from
1966 to 1980 by doctors at the Uni.

. cal School showed that 16 of 74

But in 1987, all six dog attack
fatalities involved pit bulls. ‘

“We haven’t had fatalities
from German shepherds, St. Ber-
nards or Dobermans for three
years,” Lockwood said, blaming
“the human element.”

“All of the people'who 10 years
ago had a St. Bernard or Dober-
man now have pit bulls. The num-
bers haven’t changed; there still

_ Owners don’t have to “feed

-. them. Vicious, Lockwood said.
Some dogs that have attacked hu-
imans were taught to fight and
savagely mistreated, but others
were last chained in their back
yards. ’

.t-

“Simply chaining them in their ’

i back yard and letting them go

nuts is sufficient mistreatment,”
Lockwood said. “Quite a few of
the animals involved in the fatali-
ties had been chained.”

The pit bull crisis has spot-

lighted a much larger problem,
Lockwood said: animal control
=' departments. ' '

“We have long-standing animal
control problems — it’s always
lowest priority in city services,

,. but it affects everyday life more

than anything else,” Lockwood
said. “Many cities don’t have ani-
mal control divisions with enough
manpower, expertise and bud-
get.”
The Humane Society also rec-
, ommends tough vicious—dog laws
" putting more responsibility on the
owners and giving greater pow-

“There are responsible breeders

said Susan Brooks, a spokesperson for

When these dogs are inbred (mating

overbred (mass produced for the re-

According to the latest American
Kennel Club survey — based on the
number of animals registered with
their group —— for the second consecu-
tive year, cocker spaniels are the na-
tion’s most popular purebred. A poor-
ly bred cocker spaniel is prone to eye
defects that lead to blindness and its
long ears are troubled with ear infec-
tions. '

In the past, Americans have been
sWayed in their pet choices by canine
celebrities.

Rin-Tin-Tin and Lassie made the
demand for German shepherds and
collies skyrocket. ,

Said Susan Brooks from Bide-A-
Wee: “For a while if you bought a
German shepherd it would either

have good hips and be totally bananas .

or a good brain and crippled.”
Added Dr. Lockwood: “You repeat-
edly hear about the horror stories:
People who ﬁnally get around to
buying a puppy because the kids have
always wanted Lassie and once (their)

Lassie’s home for a while, they dis- _

'Ibday, certain breeds are so popu- j

, The latest hot dogs are the Akitas,

' the Japanese dogs whose long lineage
is nothing short of aristocratic. They
cost a king’s ransom — as much as
$2,000 each. .

But one New York breeder accused
of indiscriminate breeding was said
to have done “more to damage the
breed in ﬁve or six years than the
Japanese were able to do to improve
it in 2,000.” .

Some Akita customers of this par-
ticular dealer discovered that their
high-priced purebreds suffered from

ithe crippling hip dysplasia.

Even more dangerous to unsuspect-
, ing owners are the behavioral abnor-
malities that can result from poor
breeding.

“Keep in mind that Akitas, and I

“I’ve heard of people returning

} Dr. Lockwood exclaims.

“These are living, breathing, think-
ing animals.”

He advises prospective purebreed
owners to stay away from assembly-
line pet stores:

“Only buy a puppy from a reputa-
ble breeder — that’s one that breeds

‘ selectively and allows you to visit the
kennel to meet the parents.”

But only the government can crack

says Dr. Lockwood, who warns that

even an American Kennel Club regis- .

tration cannot insure a healthy dog.
“All the AKC papers mean is that
the parents of the animal were of the

‘ breed that it’s supposed to be,” he

explains. “There are no guarantees
about the quality of the animal. Pure-
bred just doesn’t mean anything any-
more.”

It could mean endless suffering for

I both pet and owner, Dr. Lockwood

warns, adding: “Personally, I’d like to
see a return to the mutt.”

LETTERS :

Treat pit buns
like other exotics

 

To the reader who suggested in
your Aug. 10 Letters section that
the campaigns to ban pit bulls and
handguns might be veiled class
' discrimination, I would like to say,
Bull! Some eccentric rich folk
might enjoy keeping a cougar in
their yards, but city ordinances
won’t permit it. Let’s treat pit
; bulls like any other wild animal. '

As for the comparison to the
“Saturday night specials” favored
by the poor because they’re cheap
— as soon as rich people start
breaking into our homes and

 

. threatening us with their expen-
isive, fancy pistols, by God, we’ll

r ban those, too!

TAMPA TRIBUNE - Aug. 10, 1987

Alligators:
. A Valuable
4 Resource -

' A couple" of years ago, an alligator took

 

. i . the life ofa boy in St. Lucie County. Recent-
l ly:a similar tragedy took place at Wakulla
Spring. Shortly after each incident, Tribune

outdoors columnist Frank Sargeant seized
the opportunity to write pro-alligator hunt
articles replete with photos depicting ex-

ceptionally large specimens in menacing

i poses. .‘

J It seems Sargeant has an inborn fear of
alligators because over the years he has de-
scribed them as gruesome monsters and

leftovers from the prehistoric age.

 

Alligators are an invaluable part of
Florida and their demise due to ignorant
urban sprawl and human overpopulation

should not be encouraged by the opinion of
* one individual.

Before Sargeant' cleans the alligator’s

house, he needs to clean his own. I have

found the poached remains of many alliga-
tors, one as close as Lettuce Lake Park. A
few years ago, the Miami Herald estimated
that there are poachers still making a full-

time living within the boundaries of Ever-

glades National Park.

“0' Ul- 17»- w‘rm'w u.‘ '~:.‘ ::;"t.‘. 2..

' Since the average banter cannot distin-
guish the difference between cottonmouth

' 5 moccasins and the numerous non-poisonous
s ' wate‘r snakes, how can you expect him to
, determine the sex of a gator and avoxd kill-

ing pregnant females or a highly endan-

3 gered American crocodile, should its range
1 ever spread?

With the limited harvest already in op-

l eration, the nuisance gator program, and -
i the tremendous mortality of unhatched and

young alligators due to natural predation by ‘
raccoons, birds, etc., there is no need for an
open season. .
Sargeant also needs to learn that people
who do not hunt are not all misguided
“Bambi believers.” Some of us just apprecr-
ate the natural beauty of wildlife and can
enjoy it in its living condition.

Embryo transfer research is one

. taking at a time when, according to
the World Wildlife Fund, species

Sixty percent of the 220 Siberian

Tigers in US. zoos, for instance, '

came from the same seven foun-
ders. The inbreeding has caused a
number of physical defects.

“Many of the animals aren’t

going to make it unless they make it
in captivity” with special breeding
programs, says Dallas Zoo director
Warren Iliff, who also is president
of the West Virginia-based Ameri-
can Association of Zoological Parks
and Aquariums (AAZPA).

But not all conservationists
think that captive breeding pro-

grams are worth the time and ;

money.
, f‘There are a lot more important

things in this world to worry about _

. . such as controlling the world
population,” says Clark Adams, di-
rector of conservation education
programs at the Texas A&M depart-
ment of wildlife and fisheries sci-
elnces. “I hate to see critters go ex-
tinct, but they’re going to anyway.

That’s the brutal truth of things . . . .
(The researchers) are just putting .

off the inevitable.”

But zoo researchers are not will-
img to give in to the odds.
‘ “It can be really depressing to
tlhink we may not be able to do

something in the future,” says Dal—‘

agement — who should mate with
whom, how many times, at what
age, and how many offspring

‘ should be produced.

Tom Foose, AAZPA conservation
coordinator, plans to add eight pro-
grams within the next year and 12
per year after that. The goal is to
have SSP programs for 1,000 species

' by the year 2050.

The Dallas Zoo is part. of 14 SSP
programs, and the Fort Worth Zoo is
part of 13. For example, the SSP

: committee for golden liontamerins.
:' (a small monkey) has determined
" that‘Kevin, a tamerin at the Fort

7 Worth Zoo, should mate with one at
’ a zoo in Germany. 80 Kevin will

soon go on breeding loan to Ger-
many. ,

The Dallas Zoo currently has 224
animals out on loan and is hosting

; 160 animals from other zoos.

Natural breeding, though, has its

limits. Most animals, especially the '
larger ones, aren’t easy to'transfer,

and many, including the gorilla,
don’t ;breed well in captivity. For
these species, some conservation-

ists say, the hope for survival lies in
advanced breeding methods such as

embryo transfer and artifical in-

Vperimentation that must be done

using endangered animals.

Despite the success of programs

‘ like SSP and the progress being

made in high-tech methods, prob-
lems in captive breeding programs '
are abundant. The proposed 1,000
SSP programs will require 1,000
coordinators and 9,000 committee
members. And because the program
can grow only a few steps at a time,
some species are going to have to
wait. Deciding which ones is diffi-

‘ cult. -

“Who are we to play’ God?” Ra-
phael says."‘It becomes tough, be-
cause your favorite species may not
be my favoritespecies.”

Even sucessful propagation leads
to a paradox: a surplus of endan-
gered animals. Some species that
are almost extinct in the.wild, such
as the Siberian Tiger, will breed
readily in captivity, but there isn’t
room for them in zoos. The three at
the Dallas Z60 and five at the Fort.
Worth Zoo are on temporary birth
control devices.

Another problem is cost. Consid-
ering food, shelter, veterinary care
and research, Foose says, the cost
for saving endangered species in
the next century easily will be in
the hundreds of billions of dollars.

Zoos are forced to confront any

las Zoo veterinarian Bonnie Raf": semination.
i phael, who is working with Gilbert
rand others on embryo transfer re-
. search. “But we can’t just throw up g

I our hands. . . I prefer to manage my

surplus -— the animals that are
overrepresented in captivity or are
: too old to breed. In some cases, con-
servationists say, euthenasia is nec-

The Dallas Zoo is involved in two
efforts: the giraffe project and an-
other that involves transfer of a

' life from a more optimistic point of ..
view. Maybe 100 years from now the
population does level off. If we ha-

'ven’t preserved the genetic mate-

rial, then we’ve lost it.”

Zoos are trying to beat the odds ‘
‘in two ways: by researching high- '

, cial insemination, which are com-I

suni antelope embryo into a domes-
tic goat. Embryo transfer and artifi-

 

mon practices in cattle breeding,
have been used successfully for ex- ‘
otic species only a few times. Little ,
is known about the reproductive.

. cycles of most endangered species,

and years of research are necessary

‘ for each species.

, essary.

Given the probability that spe-

‘: cies will become extinct in the wild

despite efforts to preserve natural
habitat, is it all worth it?

Texas A&M conservationist
Clark Adams doubts it. Captive ani-
mals, he says, are mére clones of
their relatives in the wild. “They’re
not really the animal,” he says. And
preserving these clones for future

 




generations, he says, isn’t neces-
sary. “You don’t miss what you
never knew.” ‘

Raphael takes a more optimistic
view of future generations. “In case
somebody cares — in case the
awareness level is heightened ——
then (all the genetic material and
animals they’ve saved) will be im-
portant. I don’t think that no one

will care.”

DENVER POST - July 27, 1987

The 01111110118 mania for pit bulls

the sight of another dog, strains at his leash

a PIT BU LL dog named Gadhafi goes berserk at -

bites his own tongue, sprays saliva and blood '

Another psyched-out pit bull is so keen to attack it
tries to chew through a chain-link fence.

And a street dude named Eric tells about the litter
. of eight young pit bulls he’s raising. Only eight weeks
old, they’re already at each other’s throats.

When my photographer colleague Shepard Sherbell

came back from Baltimore’s Liberty Hill neighbor-
hood with those reports recently, I decided this was
one urban story I was happy to learn of secondhand.
. But what of the pit bulls? Can this summer’s wave
of horror stories he passed off as media hype? Hard-
' 1y. Pit bulls have inflicted 21 of the nation’s 29 fatal
canine attacks since 1983. Fourteen of the victims
have been children under 6 years of age. Each story
of a mutilated youngster’s body, torn by the vice-like
jaws that close with 1,800 pounds of pressure, ripping
off flesh with sure intent to kill, is more appalling
than the last. And for each fatality, there are dozens
of other pit bull attacks that leave victims with life-
time physical and psychological scars.

This wave of terror stalking American streets can '

Only worsen. There’s an explosion of pit bull breeding
in ghettoes and barrios Where idle, embittered youth
have chosen the animals as “macho” status symbols,
to fight and wager on. In Philadelphia, the pit- -bull

1 count has soared from 25 to 4, 000 in five years. Time ~

. magazine reports the animals are often fed gunpow-

der or hot sauces to make them mean, live kittens to,

sharpen their taste for blood.

Dogfighting is a felony in 36 states. But the husky
pit bulls, trained to fight to the death, are being
matched across the nation. “It’s getting way out of
hand, man,” a pit-bull breeder told the Los Angeles

Times. “Compton, Inglewood, Bakersfield, Hesperia ,

.there are at least three to four matches every
week, six to 10- card fights. ”

Pit bulls have become for many drug dealers the
weapon of choice - legal but more terrorizing than
, guns, ideal for holding police at bay while an illegal
stash disappears down a toilet.

Baltimore police officer Bert RicaSa relates how a .,

pit bull attacked and bit him four times as he tried to
arrest a suspected narcotics dealer. Ricasa drew his
service revolver and pumped several shots into the
dog as it dug its teeth into his thigh. But a colleague.
had to club the dying dog on the head and then use a
nightstick to pry its jaws loose. Rushed to the emer-
gency room, Ricasa required 400 stitches.

Who are these Rambos of the dog world? The an-

'swer: A breed descended from the fighting bulldolgls1 _

of 19th century England, known as American pit- b
terriers or American Staffordshire terriers. Some say
the dogs were originally bred for bear-baiting. There
are 700,000 to 1 million in the U.S.

Dog-owner groups and kennel clubs argue pit bulls , -

. aren’t the problem. They say it’s humans who breed
and raise the animals improperly. They echo the Na-
tional Rifle Association claimthat its people, not
7 guns, that kill. ‘

The argument is facile, but fallacious. The sole

function of handguns is killing. And bull terriers, how- .

”ii PBIRCE

 

ever amiable they appear, have a mark of Cain in
their genetic history: They were first bred not to re-
trieve game or herd sheep, but to kill in fierce com—
bat. Increasingly inbred and misused, more will like-

' ly turn out to be hair-trigger killers. Why shouldn’t

concerned neighbors and city councils seek curbs?
Because, claim defenders, bloodlines are so mixed

there’s no scientifically valid way to prove just which

dog is a pit bull. The very thought of bans smacks,

._they say, of “canine racism.” Torrance, Calif“ coun-
-;__cil,members considering a ban were accused of “at
tempting to do to pit bulls the same thing Hitler did to

the Jews in Germany.”

But it’s the rare pit-bull owner who doesn’t know ,
the breeds killer history. Dogs aren’t entitled to con-
stitutional protections. Anyone’ 3 legal right to own a
dangerous dog has to stop short of his neighbor’ s
throat. The real question is what kinds of curbs will
(1) restrain truly wild dogs and (2) stand up in court?

' , Here the dog clubs, backed by the Humane Society,
" " have a good argument: Instead of singling out pit

bulls, states and localities should strengthen their
“dangerousdog” ordinances. Typically, the laws re-
quire special registration, bonds and liability insur-
ance when a dog of any breed has a history of biting.
On a second offense, the animal can be confiscated
and the owner fined or imprisoned.

A model “dangerous dog” hill, just passed m Wash-

- ington state, goes further. Even before bites of hu-

mans are recorded, it makes a dog’s aggressive or
intimidating behavior, including attacks on other ani-

-. mals, a trip wire for special controls.

There is real question whether “dangerous-dog”
ordinances will deter many of the back-alley types

‘ now breeding pit bulls for 111 purpose. Or that the laws

will stop rural thugs like the bunch in Grants Pass,

~ Ore., recently found to have 25 pit bulls chained

around their 2. 345 plant marijuana farm.

But South Pasadena dog owners made a solid point
in a recent letter to the editor. “We Americans must
be the only people in the industrialized world who
stoically watch free-roaming dogs ravage trash cans,
terrorize children, scare off natural wildlife, repro-

‘ Laws to muzzle dogs have run into rrohlems 1

By DAVID McHUGH

Free Press Staff Writer
A number of communities across
the country — including Hartford, a
village in Van Buren County west of
Kalamazoo -—- have passed laws aimed
specifically at pit bulls that range from
' outright bans to muzzle to registration
3 requirements. Several of those laws,
however, have been struck down by
judges as discriminatory or too vague.
. Part of the problem is the lack of a
‘ clear definition of pit bull, a generic
term that does not refer to a specific
breed. The term is loosely applied to the
L registered breed called AmeriCan Staf-

fordshire terrier by the AmeriCan Ken-
nel Club and the AmeriCan pit bull
terrier by the United Kennel Club. The
term also refers to mixes with dogs like
rottweilers or mastiffs.

CINCINNATI’S ordinanCe bans all
pit bulls, but city offiCials stopped
enforcing the measure after the first
prosecution when no veterinarian
could be found to testify on whether
the dog in question was a pit bull.

Hartford passed a pit bull ban that is

The measure would also apply to

MEMPHIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL - August 16, 1987

Ne

' Contmversy
is created . ‘
by ruling

By Celia Hooper
United Press International

 

 

WASHINGTON —— For the US. com-
mission er of pa ten ts, new animals are
no different from tennis shoes, toast-
- ers or better mousetraps. Pa ten ting
them is simply a matter of law.

 

 

ut Donald Quigg sparked a

» storm of controversy April
7 when he ruled that new
'_ types of animals created
* {through genetic engineer-
ing or other techniques are patenta-
ble, just like any product “in which
man is involved in the making.”

In a series of hearings this summer
on Capitol Hill, animal rights activ-
ists, farm groups and religious
leaders have joined with biotechno;
logy foes to oppose Quigg’s ruling,
telling a subcommittee of the House
Judiciary Committee that allowing
patenting of animals would have in-
humane, unethical consequences
and could lead to economic ruin for
already-beleagered farmers.

“Patenting of an animal is not-a
great deal different than patenting of
anything else,” Quigg said in an inter-
view. “It’s a matter of being able to
identify the product” as having dif-
ferent properties than other extant
creatures described in the patent of-
fice’s files.

“All we can do is administer the law
that is passed by Congress and inter-
preted by the courts,” he said.

 

 

 

To fit this bill, the new animal must-

be created by an action of man and
not nature, must be novel and must
be nonobvious —— more than just a
simple variation on something that
exists already.

For instance, an animal bred to
have a unique eye color would not be
patentable —— while an animal whose
genes were altered so that it could
produce human growth hormone in

its milk might be.

E application,.the one that sparked
: Quigg’s April 7 dictate, was reject-

plants and bacteria -— were not patenv

. , ruled the office and said that when

Congress wrote the patent statutes

' they included “anything under the
1, sun that is made by man.”

The decision on patenting geneti-

., cally engineered bacteria came from
the Supreme Court in 1980 in the Dia-
mond vs. Chakrabarty case concern-
‘ ing a patent for bacteria that can
break down crude oil.

In the Chakrabarty decision the

2 court wrote that because of the word-
ing it used, Congress had thought
that patent laws “should be given

wide scope.”

ut critics of the Patent Office’s *
decision do not think Congress
had genetically engineered an-

law was written. They urged a tempo-

‘ rary moratorium on patents while
. hearings could be held.

Quigg reassured Congress that
none of the 15 animal patent applica-
tions under investigation will be at
approval stage during fiscal 1987,
which ends in September. .

Hearings before the House Judicia—
ry subcommittee on courts, civil li-
berties and the administration of J us-
tice opened in June. In late July, Rep.
Charles Rose (D-N.C.) proposed legis-
lation to stop the patent office from
approving any claims for genetically-
engineered animals, until Congress
expressly authorized it.

“The long-term economic, ethical,
environmental and governmental
consequences of this regulatory edict
are extraordinary, complex and

alarming,” Rose said. “Congress éa‘ni‘"?

not allow an issue of such magnitude
as animal patenting to be‘decided by
the appeals board at the US. Patent
and Trademark Office.”

A

nimal rights groups were the
first to testify against Quigg’s
decision and the idea of ani-

~mals as patentable widgets.

“The issue is much more‘than a
question of presumed legal authority
to issue patents on non-naturally oc-
curring organisms. It is, rather, a
question of a proper regard for the
veryessence of life itself,” said John
Hoyt, president of the Humane So-
c1ety of the United States for the past
17 years.

Hoyt said animal patenting “un-
leashes the potential for uncontrolla-
ble and unjustified animal suffer-
ing,” because “the outcome of many
genetic experiments cannot be pre-
dicted in relation to the animals’
health and welfare.”

In July the subcommittee heard
from farm and environmental
groups. The 250,000-member National
Farmers Union supported the patent
moratorium and said, “What at first
glance might appear to be a very sim-
ple, straightforward solution to deal-
ing with inventors’ rights has the po-
tential .. . of being equated to open-

ing Pandora’s box.”

Along with several other farmers’
organizations and the Environmen-
tal Policy Institute, the group said it
feared large corporations would gain
the patent rights to superior animals,
and family farmers would be forced

-to pay royalties, use inferior strains

or be driven out of business.

The environmental group said pat-
enting of plants had resulted in con-
solidation of the seed industry, witha

Georgian heads
effort to restore
dwindling herds

By Charles Seabrook

Environment Writer

 

 

An urgent new effort is under way to
rescue the northern right whale from the
brink of extinction. With only about 300 of
the giant, slow-swimming sea mammals left
alive, some experts say- efforts to save the
species have become a race against time.

During the past 18 months alone, the
battered carcasses of five young right
whales have washed ashore between Geor-
gia and Nova Scotia, apparently the victims
of ship propellers or entanglement in com-
mercial fishermen’s nets.

Congress has ap rcpriated $650,000 for
the effort to save t e whale, and a newly
appointed federal “recovery team,” headed
by Georgia conservationist Hans Neuhauser,
soon will be recommending strategies to
protect the whales, which give birth to their
young in shallow waters a few miles off the
Georgia coast. _

Right whales can reach 55 feet in
length and weigh as much as 50 tons. They
were wides read 200 years ago, ranging
along the ge of the North Atlantic from
Spain and Greenland to Georgia. A subspe-
c1es -— the southern right whale - still
thrives in the waters of the Southern
Hemisphere.

But today the northern right whale, so
named because it was the “right” whale to
hunt for both blubber and whalebone, is the
rarest whale in the world.

The whale’s lZ-inch-thick blubber and
its whalebone, the bony but flexible sub—
stance that sweeps the tiny crustaceans it
eats from the ocean waters, were highly
valued by whale hunters.

And because the whales were slow-
swimming, whaling crews could row right
up to the animals and throw harpoons into
their barnacle-covered backs. Unlike most
whales, once they were harpooned, they
floated on the surface. _

Hunters pursued the whales so relent-
lessly that by the beginning of the 20th cen-
tury, only a few hundred were left.

The hunting of right whales in US. wa-
ters was outlawed 50 years ago, but Neu-
hauser said such protection obviously has
not been enough.

“Some phenomenon has hampered the
right whale’s re-emergence, and we’ll be
trying to find out what the problem is,”
said Neuhauser. The conservationist, who
heads the Savannah office of the Georgia
Conservancy, was appointed last month as
chairman of the 11-member National Ma-
rine Fisheries Recovery Team for the Right
Whale.

Scott Kraus, a whale expert at the New
England Aquarium in Boston, said, “The
risk is fairly high that the northern right
whale won’t survive without better protec-
tion. We need a better understanding of the
animal’s habits to learn how to protect it.”

The recovery team hopes to fashion a
plan that will enable the right whale to

make the same kind of comeback that other
onceendangered species have made. Fifty
years ago, for instance, the number of Cali-
fornia gray whales had dwindled to about
200. Now there are more than 20,000, large-
ly due to commercial whaling bans.

One strategy being considered is the use
of offshore buoys along the whale’s 1,200-
mile migratory route from coastal Georgia
to the Bay of Fundy that would emit irri-
tating, high-pitched sounds to steer migrat-

It was only four years ago that
researchers located the calving
ground -- in the shallow waters a
few miles off the coast of Georgia
and northern Florida. The Georgia
Legislature later designated the ani-
mal as the state marine mammal.

Neuhauser said no one knows
why the animals prefer Georgia and
northern Florida waters for their
nursery. But he said the continuing
buildup of Kings Bay Naval Subma-
rine Base on the Georgia coast and
the dredging of nearby waters
threatens the calving grounds with
siltation and increased ship traffic.

“The biggest concentration of
right whales is found in that area,”
he said. “It presents a serious prob-

lem to continuation of the species, '

and one of the primary things we’ll
be looking at is how to accommo-
date both the naval base and the
whales’ calving preferences.” ,
Two years ago, Neuhauser asked
the Interior Department to reconsid-
er its plans to lease rights to ex-
plore offshore for oil and gas. The
auction ultimately was canceled, not
because of the whales but because
the auction of North Atlantic tracts

drew little interest from oil compa-'

,_ nies. at that time.

 

Neuhauser said he also is con-
cerned about whale-watching boats,
especially in New England waters,
where commercial sightseeing tours
are common.

"Whale-watching is an industry
unto itself in New England,” he
said. “If pe0ple get too close, they

disturb: the animal’s behavior, and
sometimes they can actually endan-
ger the animal itself.”

But Kraus said ships’ propellers
and fishermen’s nets pose an even
bigger problem. Because they are

air-breathing animals, whales that.

GLACIER NATIONAL PARK, Mont.

~. N the stormy morning of Aug. 13, 1967, two back.-

packers in the rugged mountain backcountry

. here were killed by grizzly bears. The killings,

*I the first in the park’s history, forced the Na-

tional Park Service to rethink the relationship between
wildlife and people. .

Twenty years and numerous policy changes later, of-
ficials in Glacier and Yellowstone Parks are still re-
evaluating their management of the bears. With more
than three million people a year passing through the

parks, there is no way to keep the two species apart. A -
visit to'these vestiges of wilderness, biologists say, will,

always carry with it the risk of an attack. Since 1967, 10
people have been killed by bears in Yellowstone and Gla-
cier, and dozens more have been mauled. The most re-
cent death occurred last April, when a grizzly sow in Gla-
cier killed a photographer who got too close to her cubszv.
“The visitor has to be prepared to visit the park on
the park’s terms,” said Cliff Martinka, who has been a
biologist at Glacier since the'frightening summer of 1967
and who has overseen many of the changes in policy.

“Our job is not to manage the park into submission. Our

job is to manage it so it stays that way.”

The young women slain in 19675were dragged from'

the campgrounds where they were sleeping, about 10
miles apart, in a violent electrical storm. Both areas had
been frequented by “mugger” bears that had lost their
innate fear of humans and had come to associate them
with garbage and food. The goal of the Park Service’s
new policy was to make the bear population wild again.
To that end, park officials embarked on a campaign

to change the bears’ imageias cute and cuddly. The gar--

bage dumps, where people once came to view the ani-

mals, were immediately shut down. Signs were erected ,
at park entrances and trail heads, warning, “Bears are :
extremely dangerdus.Use extreme caution.” A bear that ‘
shows no fear of humans is tranquilized and moved to an-

other, more remote area. .
One such attempt went awry last week when par

rangers attempted to move a grizzly sow and two cubs ‘

that had been approaching hikers along the popular '

gHighline Trail. One cub was accidentally killed when the

tranquilizer dart pierced its heart. The mother and sur—

. viving cub were removed to a wilderness area.

Sometimes people are required to change their 1

ways, too. If bears are active at a campground or along

the trail, those areas will be closed —- as six trails, includ- ,

ing the Highline, have been in the last few weeks.
. The Increase in bear maulings that began in 1967,
biologists say, is primarily the result of the national

parks’ increasing popularity. Mr. Martinka said park "

managers had taken all the measures they could without
threatening the primitive nature of the parks. The Park
SerVIce 18 under a 60-year-old mandate from Congress to

”-5 also protected under the Endangered Species Act. 7‘
h" For most of its history of exposure to humans, when
lthe grizzly approached people, the people struck back.
3 The bears learned to keep a distance from man. Now,
Mr. Martinka said, “we’ve created something that might
not be natural -— a totally protected grizzly bear.”
“Should we allow hunting to preserve. the natural
behavior of bears? Is there something we can substitute?‘
Can we shoot a bear with rubber bullets or find some so-
phisticated chemical? Those are questions that not only
can’t we answer, but that we haven’t even raised.”

' Mm
MM“-'~—~-m

The fact that humans are not at the top of the food” .

chain here has not kept hikers from Glacier’s wild trails.
,“I have a healthy respect for grizzlies,” said Helen Red-
man, a dental hygienist from Beloit, Wis., as she headed
into the backcountry recently with a friend. “But I don’t
worry that much about it. It’s not debilitating.”

Still, there is a small industry in bear repellents.

Hikers, for example, can buy “bear bells,” and com-
pressed air horns are sometimes used to frighten the ani-
mals. One popular repellent is “Counter Assault,” a can
of aerosol-propelled red pepper that works like Mace.

Kate Kendall, a park bear biologist, has doubts about
its efficacy but carries the acrid spray. “If a bear’s going
to charge, I don’t think spraying a little pepper is enough
to stop all that inertia,” she said. “But I think that bears
that drag people out of a tent in the middle of the night
are a different kind of bear. And spraying at that kind of
bear might give you time to climb a tree.”

NEW YORK TIMES

 

By JOAN COOK

There is a new breed of veterinar~
ians, a highly trained, sophisticated
group whose practices increasingly
parallel human medicine in everything
from equipment and treatment to com-
pute1ized record- keeping and billing

When Pamela Abney graduated
' from Auburn Veterinary School in Ala-
bama in 1979, female veterinarians
were relatively rare. Now a majority of
graduates are women because Of an in
crease in both the number of schOols
and female applicants, and because of
changes in admission policies in state-
aided schools, and a decline in male ap-
, plicants.

Dr. Abney, president of the Veteri~
nary Medical Association of New York
City, an organization of more than 200
veterinarians from the five boroughs,
said another change is the introduction
of business administration courses into
the curriculum.

“in the past,‘veterinarians knew a lot
of medicine, but they didn’t know how
to run a business,” she said. “Medicat
doctors don’t have to know how to run a

hospital. They bring their expertise to
' an already functioning institution.”

Expensive Treatments

But the greatest change for many pet
owners is not who the veterinarian is,
or how the bills are sent out, but the

medicine into the realm of high tech-
nology and specialties.

“Today it is possible to do a hip re-
placement, say, on an animal and have
it returned to normal life in a short
time, when 10 or 20 years ago that. ani—
mal would have had to be put to sleep,”
he said. “This can be done, but the
procedure is expensive in animals as it
is in humans."

As a result, today’s veterinarians are
faced with what Dr. Kram refers to as
“the cute animal problem. Because of

, more sophisticated technology, a doc-

{tor often has the capability of returning
ian animal to good health, but at consid—
Eeiable cost which puts the owner in a
*tough position.

“Ownei 5 want the best for their pets,
but they can’t understand why a bill
can run as high as $500 or more for a
pet they only paid $2 for,’ he said.
“They don’t take into account labora-
tory costs, equipment and hospital ex-

Dear Mrs. Yarborough:
Thank you for letting me know of your support for H.R. 2883,

a bill to provide for the conveyance of the Silver Spring monkeys
to Primarily Primates in Texas.

The work of Dr. Taub at the Institute for Behavior Research
in Silver Spring, Maryland, is one of the best publicized cases
of inhumane animal experiments, and I am aware of the terrible
treatment these monkeys received during his experiments.

Congressman Smith introduced this legislation in order to
mandate what many Members of Congress had previously requested:
that the monkeys from Dr. Taub's experiments be released into the
custody of Primarily Primates for the remainder of their lives.
H.R. 2883 has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce, and I am eagerly awaiting its passage out of committee
and subsequent passage by the full House of Representatives. You
can be certain that the rights of animals to humane treatment
will be foremost in my mind once this legislation is before the
Senate.

Thank you again for taking the time to bring this important
issue to my attention. I hope you will continue to keep me up to
date on your opinions regarding issues important to us all.

even better.

Marshall Meyers, spokesperson for
the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Coun-
cil, a trade association based in Wash-

the billions of dollars, but “there is

One indicator of this upscale interest
was the success of Dogue, a high-fash.

all-dog motif. When Ilene Hochberg
wrote Dogue she expected it to sell
about 20,000 copies A year later it had
sold more than 200,000 copies (at $8.95)

The Debate:
KILLER DOGS

Today’s debate includes our opinion that states can con-
trol vicious dogs through tough laws and it isn’t neces-
sary to ban a particular breed, an opposing view from
Ohio, other views from California, Virginia, and the Dis-
trict of Columbia, and voices from across the USA.

Control pit bulls
with strong laws

Remember Nipper, the RCA Victor dog who listened
with head cocked to “his master’s voice”? And Tige, the
smiling mutt who lived in a shoe with Buster Brown?

It wasn’t too long ago that US. merchandisers routinely
chose good old U.S.-bred dogs like these —- pit bull terriers
-— as trademarks for their products.

But pit bulls have changed. Now their owners name them
“Ripper,” “Chopper,” and “Killer.” And their modern repu-
tation suggests they would make better symbols for killing
machines than for Victrola talking machines.

In recent years, pit bulls have been bred to ﬁght because
there’s a bull market for ﬁghter dogs. Drug dealers buy vi-
cious dogs to ﬁght off narcs. Teen gang members keep
them to terrorize rivals. And self-styled “sportsmen” raise
them to ﬁght other pit bulls —- to the death.

This year, six people have died from dog-related injuries
— all victims of pit bulls. In the last 18 months, 67% of US.
dog-related deaths are blamed on pit bulls — which ac-
count for little more than 1% of the dog population.

I In San Jose, Calif., James Soto, 21/2, toddled within
reach of a pit bull that was guarding a marijuana crop in
June. The dog killed him; his body was “unrecognizable.”

“I In Dayton, Ohio, retired surgeon William Eckman, 67,
was attacked by two pit bulls and died after a 25-minute
,mauling April 6. The dogs “literally tore him apart.”

I In Jones, Okla, also on April 6, Mellissa Larabee, 11/2,
was killed by one of the three pit bulls owned by her par-
ents. “The wounds were inﬂicted to the throat,” police said.

There are 500,000 pit bulls — dom that are all or part
American pit bull terrier or American Staffordshire terrier
, -- in the USA. Many of them are just as lovable as Pete, the

ring-eyed mascot of the Our Gang comedies. But then
there’s Rocky, who was sentenced in June to death by lethal
injection for attacking a man in Douglas County, Ore.

How did a breed of lovable mutts produce so many four-
legged wins? Man intervened —- cruelly -—— by breeding
them to ﬁght and training them to kill. Man bred the love
out of some dogs and bred hatred in.

This inhumane practice of training killer dogs must stop.

Owners must be prosecuted to the fullest extent the law
allows if their dogs injure anyone. Owners also should be

liable for damages. Leash laws designed to keep Spot out of 3

the neighbor’s garbage are simply not tough enough to con-
trol ﬁght-trained canine killers. And ofﬁcials must crack
down harder on dog ﬁghting, which is illegal in all 50 states.

Because barbaric humans train other breeds to kill, too,
pit bulls should not be targeted alone. Rhode Island has the
right idea. Its new law makes owners of vicious dog carry

$100,000 in liability insurance and permits ofﬁcials to seize ~

dogs of any breed involved in “unprovoked” attacks.

We need more state action to control killer dogs and the
people who would turn their dogs into killers.

It is unforgivable when “his master’s voice” encourages a
dog to hate and kill. It is sick to train man’s best friend to
become his mortal enemy.

Killer instinct is in their blood

ALEXANDRIA, Va. — I’ve
never seen a dog as aggressive
and ferocious as the pit bull.
Even as young as three days,
pit bulls sometimes growl and
show signs of aggression. In my
many years of breeding, show-
ing, and being around dogs,
I’ve never known another
breed to do that It seems the
killer instinct is in their blood.

There are some good and x

friendly pit bulls. This confuses
people because often the one
pit bull they’ve met is as sweet
as a beagle. It is the pit bulls
that are inbred that, in many
cases, are the dangerous ones.
You see, “pit bull” is a very
broad term that encompasses a
number of individual breeds as
well as mixes in interbred
lines, not all of which are vi-
cious by nature. It all depends
on the dog’s lineage.

To some people, apparently,
the dogs considered best for
breeding are the mean ones.

And if you have a male and a
female that are related, both
mean, breeding these two dog
will produce a meaner, better
ﬁghting machine. These inbred
bulls are excellent fighting
dogs because they are doubly
nasty and out of their heads.
The breeders who raise pit

bulls for their ﬁghting capabili- '

ties know this. I have met peo-
ple who prefer a mean pit bull
for the sole purpose of entering
it in an illegal, organized-gam-
bling dog ﬁght. In these ﬁghts,
the dogs are put into a pit —
that’s how they get part Of their
name — to ﬁghteach other un-
til death or apparent death.
I’ve been told of a bull that
ended up having her back leg
ripped off except for a small
amount of ﬂesh. The owner
was going to kill the dog, but
someone asked to have it for a

pet For $800-plus in veterinary ‘

bills, the dog was put back to-

Guest columnist

At bottom, it’s a“ h

WASHINGTON — Severe or
fatal attacks by a variety of
types of dogs have been a seri-
ous problem nationwide for
more than a decade. Recently,
the focus of attention has be-
come the pit bull. '

It is true that “pit bull” dogs
— which can include a variety
of breeds and mixed breeds —
can pose special difﬁculties be-
cause they share a common
heritage. Dogs used for ﬁghting
were bred to inﬂict maximum
damage on their opponents
and to continue to ﬁght despite
pain and serious injury.

But this doesn’t mean all pit
bulls are inherently dangerous.
. Many dogs have a long history
of breeding aimed at overcom-
, ing the problems of this ances-
’ try and emphasizing good tem-
f; perament. But criminal and ir-
| responsible owners continue to
breed, raise, and train dog
that are aggressive to animals

and humans alike. These dog
and owners are causing many
of today’s problems.

Pit bulls and pit bull mixes
have been involved in a dispro-
portionate number of recent
dog-related human fatalities (7
of 13 in 1986; 6 of 6 in 1987).
There have been about a dozen
such incidents in each of the

last 10 years, but the breeds

and mixed breeds involved
have changed; only recently
have pit bulls headed the list.
The one constant factor has
been that most serious dog at-
tacks are the direct result of se-
rious, even criminal negli-
gence on the part of the dog’s
owner — a human problem.
Legislation based on the as-
sumption that all pit bulls are
problems and all problems are
due to pit bulls ignores the
much larger issue of irrespon-
sible ownership and cannot
work over the long term.

Timothy W. Lane is a for-
mer dog breeder.

 

sive to people and other dog
and must be restrained for fear
that it could kill. These dogs
cannot be rehabilitated.

Stricter laws should be en-
acted for pit bulls, as for, any
aggressive dog. At least as im-
portant, if not more so, breed-
ing should be monitoredlvery
closely. Any kennel club that
recognizes the pit bull as a
breed should be required to
make sure a pit bull is not the
offspring of two related pit
bulls. And if these dogs attack
and kill, they should not be al-
lowed to live, because if a dog
attacks once, he will again.

Owners don’t realize the ag-
gressiveness of these dogs can
be fatal, even to themselves.
And when they bite, they don’t
let go, they rip. They let go only
when the ﬂesh is ripped off.
And then they bite again.

Randall Lockwood is higher
education director, Humane
Society of the United States.

 

Breed-speciﬁc laws can penal-
ize responsible owners and
good dogs while failing to ad-
dress problems posed by other
breeds and negligent owners.
Simply deﬁning the dogs to be
covered under such legislation
can open the door to costly,
time-consuming challenges
and disputes at a time when
immediate action is needed.

A better solution is stringent,
generic, dangerous-dog laws
that include provisions for
identifying dangerous dogs and
irresponsible owners before
someone is attacked and that
provide stiff penalties for those
unwilling or unable to control
their animals. Also important
are felony penalties for dog
fighting, the root cause of
many of our pit bull problems.

 




’NEAE ZIMMERS ‘
. An opposing view

 

Don’t stop with laws;
ban these killer dogs

DAYTON, Ohio — While pit
bulls constitute less than 3% of
the US. dog population, in 1986
they were responsible for sev-
en of the 13 fatal dog bites. In
1987 alone, their attacks have
killed an average of one person
per month. Unfortunately,
more often their victims are
the elderly or children.

Pit bulls are a breed apart
from other canines. The pit
bull’s physical propensities are
terrifying! Its muscularity pro-
vides it the ability to jump six
to eight feet in the air, its jaws
are said to be ﬁve times more
powerful than a Doberman’s,
and it has the ability to breathe
while clamped onto an object,
thus allowing it to hold its bite
for long periods of time. The at-
tack of the pit bull is generally
sudden and without warning,

. which makes it especially dan-
gerous. In addition, it has a
unique gamenees and willing-
ness to ﬁght to the death.

It has experienced a fast
growth in popularity in many
lower socioeconomic areas.
The dog has become a new
weapon because of the fear it
strikes in others and is often
brandished on a chain in public
areas. Police have said the ani-
mal is popular among persons
involved in illegal activities be-
cause of what veterinarians
generally term its “genetic pre-
disposition” for aggression.

The Ohio Legislature adopt-
ed a measure which requires
owners of vicious dogs to keep

'them chained or within a
chain-link enclosure with a top,
and off the premises either on
a metal chain not more than
six feet in length or muzzled.
Additionally, owners must ob-
tain $50,000 liability insurance.

A vicious dog is one that has ‘

injured a human being or
killed another animal. Con-
cerned that a pit bull will often
cause severe injuries, even
death, the Legislature speciﬁ-
cally classiﬁed pit bulls as vi-
cious dog's. Our intent is to pre-
vent pit-bull attacks and con-
.trol the animal without waiting
until it iniuressomeone.

I feel that, at a minimum, pit,

bulls should be banned in resi-
dential areas, but the insur-
ance provision and other con-
trol features of our new law
should be extremely effective

weapons against irresponsible

owners. Those who brandish it
as a “macho dog" will no long-

er be able to do so. Additional- '

1y, most other irresponsible
owners will be unable to obtain
liability insurance and there-
fore unable to own a pit bull.

‘ Some may challenge the
constitutionality of singling out

i a speciﬁc breed and Ohio’s

right to enact this law. But we
feel conﬁdent the measure is
constitutional and it is clearly
within our prerogative to pass
such laws. The right of citizens
to feel free to use the public ar-
eas of their communities, even

; ‘their own back yards, without

fear of attack by a vicious dog
is paramount to individuals’
right to town that particular
item of personal property.
People who claim that irre-
sponsible pit-bull owners are
ruining their ownership for all
are correct But that assertion
does little to ease the ever-in-
creasing incidence of people

. and animals falling prey to un-‘
i provoked attacks by pit bulls. ‘

JAMES HARTLEY, 66

Pit bulls ought to be banned -

from cities, where they can
roam and attack people. When
they are born, they should be
neutered, which would wipe
out the species. That might be a
better idea. But the big catch is,
how do we enforce those laws
once they are enacted? I’d like
them, but I worry they couldn’t
be enforced.

TALIJA WOOLLE Y, 26

I am not afraid of pit bulls.
All of them aren’t vicious. I live
next door to a pit bull. I took
care of her once, and she is the
nicest dog you’d ever want to
meet. They shouldn’t be sin-
gled out for special treatment. I
am against dog discrimination.
All attack dog, of whatever
breed, should be penned up,
though.

Pit bulls are no'worse than
any other dogs. If they are

trained to be vicious, that’s all

they can be. It’s the owner’s
fault, not the dog’s. The dogs
shouldn’t be banned, but their
owners should be ﬁned for
training them to be vicious.
The pit bulls I see aren’t vi-
cious because they live in
homes with kids around.

WADE HOOPES, 31

Something should be done
about all dogs with vicious rep-
utations. Owners of vicious
dogs should be made to post a
bond, so if their dog maul or
kill someone, there will be
money to pay hospital or funer-
al bills. It’s the pit bull today,
but the Doberman and Ger-
man shepherd used to cause
the same concern.

LYNN FOLEY, 22

People have pets that they
love like kids. Those pets are
OK. The dangerous ones are
those being bred to ﬁght. How
do you discipline the bad pit
bulls Without creating a prob-
lem for the good ones? Still, if
you don’t think this is an impor-
tant issue, with people being
malmed and killed, then you
don’t value human life.

Pit bulls have gotten a bad
name, which is overblown. If a
particular dog mauls someone,
then that dog should be done
away with. I would, however,
support strict laws for curbing
the vicious ones. Fines don’t
hurt much, so owners of vi-
cmus dogs should receive jail
sentences. That would get the
message across

Burlington, Va.

I don’t think pit bulls should
be destroyed, but they deﬁnite-
ly should be banned from
densely populated areas. I read
about a woman who was at-
tacked in the middle of the

thlngs that are happening. Pit

TAMPA TRIBUNE - August 7, 1987

traveling too tough

By PAUL F. POWER Jr.
‘ Tribune Staff Writer

_. TAMPA — Barbara, 3 6,000-
pound elephant at Busch Gardens,
has a date with Mickey Mouse at
Epcot Center. _

' But the Walt Disney people, who
pride themselves on creating magic,
can’t find a suitable truck to take

“the 18-year-old Asian elephant from

, Tampa to Lake Buena Vista.

‘ Disney wants Barbara for a pho-

'tograph to promote a new, outdoor

'daredevil act scheduled to begin
this fall. The idea was to have Bar-

ibara pose for a picture with Mickey

"in front of the large, golf ball-

'shaped object known as Spaceship

“Earth. _

' ' For two weeks, Disney has tried
and failed to find a truck large
enough to move Barbara, Disney
spokesman Tom Brinkmoeller said

Thursday afternoon. The publicity .

plans could be dashed if a truck
" isn’t found within a week.

Circuses that ordinarily winter .

in Florida are on the road up north,
’and their animal-hauling trucks
"aren’t available, said Roman
‘Schmitt, 35, who owns Barbara and
’10 other elephants he keeps at
’Busch Gardens for the park’s ele-
phant breeding program. .
“We have a van that we could
" have used,” Brinkmoeller said, “one
'that we use for (transporting) draft
_ "horses. It’s probably big enough, but
' it has custom cabinets inside.”

;‘ That idea was discarded over
'the fear that Barbara would dam-
age the cabinets by poking her 6-
foot trunk around — and into —- the
cabinets.

Walt Disney employees were ne-
gotiating Thursday afternoon with a
circus that was in eastern New
York with hopes that a truck could
be sent to Florida to move Barbara,
Brinkmoeller“ said. Other out-of-
state circuses also were being con-
tacted.

Barbara, who is from Thailand,
is a 15-year circus veteran. “She
was picked because she is an entire-
ly docile animal,” Schmitt said.

Barbara won’t perform in the
new daredevil act; she is being rent:
ed for the photographand would re-
turn to Busch Gardens when her
work is done.

“It’s Such short notice,” Schmitt ‘

said, explaining why theme park
representatives may be experienc-
ing a problem moving the elephant.
“You don’t just go out and get a reg-
ular box van.”

Experts said the truck should be
9 feet tall, because Barbara stands
about 81/2 feet tall at the shoulders.
The truck also should have air con-
ditioning, a low center of gravity to
keep it from tipping over, a low
gate for loading and a place for
Barbara to be tethered inside.

A furniture moving van or simi-
lar vehicle could be commissioned
for the move, Schmitt said, as long
as the floor is a foot or so from the
ground. He said the doors would
have to remain open for ventilation.

A conventional tractor-trailer,
which has a floor 5 or 6 feet from
the roadway, wouldn’t be consid-
ered because walking an elephant
up a ramp that high is risky, he add-
ed.

Busch Gardens’ Barbara is too big for most trucks, so she may
miss her date with a mouse at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena
Vista. With her is assistant trainer Bill Shields.

beef.

;“It fools them into believing they
are eating ants,” said Robert Snyder,
director of the Penrose Laboratory at
the Philadelphia 200.

j For more than half a Century, the
nation’s oldest zoo laboratory has been
seeking to develop nutritious meals
that captive animals like. A menu for
1,400 animals — 550 species — is not
an easy task.

After all, what would you feed a
red-crested poshard. or a moluCCan
radjah shelduck? Or how would you
keep a brush-tailed phalanger from
squawking about Commissary food?

Before the 1930s, most zoo animals
had short life spans beCause of diseases
and poor nutrition. But in 1935, Her-
bert Ratcliffe, the lab’s seCond direc-
tor, changed all that with the introduc-
tion of zoocake, a nutritionally

balanced food that Can feed almost any .

kind of animal. _

“The prinCiples of feeding exotic
animals that he developed. are now
used all over the world,” said Snyder.
“The diets are continually being re-
fined. But the basic formulas are pretty
close to the ones that he developed half
a century ago.”

" Today, four Chefs, using giant mix-
ers, make three varieties of zoocake at
the Philadelphia Zoo’s Herbert Rat-

en parts, then paCk it into rectangular
tins and refrigerate it.

In addition, the 200’s animals eaCh
week consume about 25,000 Crickets,
1,000 white miCe, 40 Cases of esCarole,
600 pounds of Carrots and 280 pounds
of apples. Vampire bats lap up Cow’s
blood. And suCh Carnivores as lions and

- polar bears eat fresh rabbits, ChiCkens,

miCe and horses.

» “We go through about two horses a
week,” said Barbara Toddes, the 200’s

animal nutritionist. The 200’s food bud- j

get comes to about $260,000 a year.

Many animals have favorite snaCks.
The gorillas like popcorn. The river
otters enjoy crayfish. -

And the Cougars lOve to Chew on
oxtails. “It’s mainly for recreation, but
it does help keep the plaque off their
teeth,” Toddes said.

The zoo does not try to duplicate the‘
animals’ native diets. “It would be '
economiCally unfeasible,” she said.
“And often what the animals eat in the
wild is not the best thing for them.”

business manager, said average
summer attendance is usually
3,600 paid and 2,200 free. About
1,220 people came during the
hour after the zoo opened at 9

Zoo officials are hoping to set
an attendance record this
month, which may mean a rec-
ord year for the zoo.

The previous record was set in
May 1985, when 155,442 people
visited the zoo to see Ayers the

573,009, also a record. This year,
326,439 people had visited the

director for Memphis State Uni-
versity, Ms. Hoyo said there
seemed to be a difference
between Mexican and Memphis
panda-gazers.

“In Mexico, the children are
more awed by the panda, but
here the adults seem more taken
by the panda,” she said. “Here
the adults seem to realize the
value of the animal, that it may
be a once-in-a-lifetime exper-
ience to see a panda.”

Scientists believe there may
be only about 700 members of
the endangered species left. in
the wild. The bearlike mammals
live exclusively in the mountain
bamboo forests of China.

One of yesterday’s happy visi-
tors was Lucrecia Cooper, 15, of
Murfreesboro, Tenn, who came
to the zoo with her parents and
two sisters to see Xiu-Hua.

“I’ve been waiting to see a panda
for 15 years,” she said.

Wanda Calvert of Lutts, Tenn,
wore a panda-print blouse. “I
saw it in the store, and I thought,
‘Well, I might as well buy it if I’m
going to the zoo,’ ” she said.

Asked about the panda, 9-year-
old Teresa Robinson, one of
about 25 members of the Faith
Temple Church of God in Christ
at the zoo, said: “He was pretty.”

Teresa’s confusion over the
panda’s gender is shared by the
panda’s keepers. Although Xiu-
Hua is believed to be a female
and is referred to by zoo officials
as a “she,” Dr. Juan Tellez, chief
veterinarian for the pandas of
Chapultepec Park, said Xiu-
Hua’s sex is not certain.

Dr. Tellez said he will go to the

Xiu-Hua brings
out the. oooh’s

Staff Reporter

 

“:1; he slumbered; spectators oqio-o-ed.
She lumbered; they a-h-hled.
.3 Xiu-Hua, the giant panda, rolled about
skittishly and her caretakers rushed to
soothe her. . -
They moved the noisy siamang apes
3:2 that disrupted her sleep; they turned off
., _. I: the lights that irritated her eyes; they
clipped the lawn with handshears so the electric
mower wouldn’t startle her; they ordered sunshine
when thunder frightened her. .

“She’s afraid of any~ noise she’s not familiar with,”

  
   

 

....

 

said Dr. Juan Tellez, Chief medical officer for the pan- .

das at Chapultepec Park Zoo in Mexico City. He took
for granted spending his days watching his charge’s
every move at Memphis Zoo and Aquarium. Besides,
he had a book ——- on gorillas - for entertainment. “I’m
not bored at all.”

Joe Howze was not quite as magnanimous -—-- and no
wonder. He was forced to clip the 1,200 square feet of
grass in Xiu-Hua’s outdoor playground with hand-
held shears Tuesday in the 99-degree temperature ——
with a heat index of 114 if you consider humidity.

The job took Howze at least 20 minutes more than
using the electric mower."‘It was hot,” he said after-
ward, as he wiped his face with a sweat-drenched tow-
el. “You know how it is. It’s my job and I did it. I guess
it’s kind of exciting to do things for a rare animal. You

. don’t see them every day.” -

And when you do, you are mesmerized by her every
move —— judging from the people who cooed and
waved at the 200’s new arrival earlier this week. Her
stay here has been extended through Sept. 4.

What’s a panda to do with all this attention?

Sleep. Like an infant. ,

If Xiu-Hua raised a paw; rolled over or wiggled her
oversized cottontail as she slumbered, spectators
shrieked and scampered along her glassed-in pen for

at day to catch a
glimpse of Xiu-Hua in herindoor display.

a better view. Cameras flashed like sparks on an elec-

tric saw. .. .

“Oh, look he’s scratching himself,” gasped Cathy
Fletcher of Memphis.

“Oh-h-h, lo-o-o-k, he’s yawning,” echoed a chorus of
spectators, cameras poised for action.

“I think he’s going to get up!” they exclaimed.

And so the spectators stood in the sweltering heat to
see the first giant panda to visit the South and the first

panda to visit the United States independent of Chin- '

ese government control. No one made an effort to re-
strain the children who dangled like orangutans
from the pen’s gate. 4 ’

Dori Griffin looked with amusement at the audi-.

ence, not the bear. “Theyooh and ah, they sure do,”
said the docent, who teaches sixth grade at Delano
Elementary School in Frayser. “She’ll stretch a paw
and everyone starts rushing around and getting real
excited.” * .

Once the. 21/2-year-old finally did wake, she still
couldn’t compete with the activity of her admirers.
She sulked in a corner and people clasped their hands
in glee. She stood like a tottering teepee of fur and
they gushed. She waddled like a babe in diapers and

they beamed‘like proud parents.

 

   

 

When she stood and stretched her limbs, you would
have thought Don Johnson had walked into the pri-

' mate house.

The highlight of the day for panda and audience is

dinner. Like a child, Xiu-Hua plays with her 18.5

pounds of milk, boiled rice, eggs, bran, pureedcar5
rots, chicken and beef. She sniffs it, Spills it, dips her,

nose in it and finally guzzles it down. .

Not even that could hold Jay McDonald’s interest. _
. “Mom, can we go now?” begged the 6-year-old, as he
leaned against his mother, whose eyes remained fix-r
ated on the animal.
“But I came to see the panda, baby,” said Meredith
McDonald. .
The devotion of adults to the panda amazed Marie-
lena Hoyo Bastien, administrator of the Chapultepec
Park Zoo in Mexico City, where children clamor to see- ‘

. the animal. “Adults here realize how rare the panda is

. . children only know it’s beautiful and nice”;L

Even greater a surprise, she said, was how familiar
people were with Xiu‘Hua’s name, which is Chihese
for Dandelion. “In Mexico, they don’t know it yet.”

When they weren’t oohing, the visitors were asking
questions about the panda’s diet, age, weight -—- 'gand
most importantly, when would she awaken. , i .

“I had one woman ask why they don’t clean and' .
groom it,” said docent Val Olcott. “I said, ‘Wait a min- -
ute! This is a wild animal!’ I’m sure this woman has a
poodle back home. You just don’t comb and curl a pan-
da. She’s 300 pounds of wild animal.” !

Some visitors said they were disappointed to learn
that Xiu-Hua is most playful in the morning from 7:30
to 9, before the zoo opens to anyone but zoo officials
and members of the Zoological Society. That’s when -
Xiu-Hua lumbers into her yard, lugs her 285 pounds-
up her pagoda slide, and wooshes into her pool. She
sleeps the rest of the day and night, except for meal -
time at 11 am. and 4 pm.

The zoo is open daily from 9 am. to 6 pm, with the
last admittance at 5 pm. Tickets are $2.25 for adults
and $1 for senior citizens and children 2 toll. Admis-
sion is free from 3:30 to 5 pm. Saturdays. ~. w

“I wish she would just sit up,” said Kimberly Vail, _
who drove Tuesday about 45 minutes from her home .'
in Senatobia, Miss. to see Xiu—Hua. -.

' COnnie Rotella of Memphis was less impatient. “I
just could stay there all day long and watch it sleep. It .
was adorable.” . '

NOTES

GOING To THE
CATS

A;

VERY DECADE OR so the United

States of America crosses some por-
tentous new threshold that symbolizes
the nation’s evolution from one kind of
society into another. It crossed one after
the Second World War, when for the ﬁrst
time in history American men bought
more belts than they did suspenders. It
crossed another in the mid-19505, when
the number of tractors on American
farms for the first time exceeded the
number of horses. Now, in the 19803,
the country faces a new demographic re-
ality: the number of cats in American
households is rapidly overtaking, if it
has not already overtaken, the number
of dogs. According to the Pet Food Insti-
tute, a Washington-based trade associ-
ation, there were about 18 million more
dogs than cats in the United States as re-
cently as a decade ago, but today there
are 56 million cats and only 52 million
dogs. Actually, because millions of un-
registered dogs andcats—the illegal
aliens of the animal kingdom—go un-
counted, it may be that dogs still main-
tain a slight edge. But sales of dog food
are holding steady, whereas sales of cat
food have been increasing in recent
years at an annual rate of ﬁve to eight
percent. The trend is clear.

This is not the place to dredge up all
the old arguments on the relative merits
of cats and dogs, friend of the mouse
though I am. But it does seem to me that
the displacement of (Janis familiaris by
Felis catas might tell us something larger
about the condition of the republic,
much as from a single drop of rain (to

14

cite Sherlock Holmes’s famous example)
one might infer the existence of oceans.
Consider an America congenial to the
dog: it was a place of nuclear or ex—
tended families, of someone always
home, of children (or pet) looked after
during the day by a parent (or owner), of
open spaces and family farms, of sticks
and leftovers, of expansiveness and
looking outward and being outside; it
was the America of Willa Gather and
Lassie and Leon Leonwood Bean. Con-
sider an America conducive to the eat: it
is a place of working men and women
with nor much time, of crowded cities,
of apartment buildings with restrictive
clauses, of day-care and take-out food,
of self-absorption and modest horizons;
it is the America of Tama Janowitz and
Blade Runner and The Sharper Image
catalogue.

These generalizations may, I sup-
pose, be extreme, but they are prompt-
ed in part by the new, 1987 edition of
the Statistical Abstract of tlze United States,
which I recently received in the mail.
This may be the best book the govern-
ment publishes, and I wish I could ear-
mark my taxes every year to pay the sal-
ary of its editor. According to the
Abstract, here is some of what has hap-
pened to the country from the time
when dogs were an overwhelming ma-
jority of household pets (I’Ve chosen the
early to middle 19705) to the present
day: the amount of land claimed by
cities increased by 191,795 square miles,
or 49 percent; the number of people liv-

, ing in cities increased by 33 million; the

number of households consisting of only
one person doubled, to 21 million, and
33a proportion of all households in-
creased by 41 percent; the number of
families headed by only one parent more
than doubled, to 7 million, and as a pro—
portion of all families increased by 100
percent; the proportion of childless cou-
ples with both partners in the labor force
increased by 9.5 percent; the proportion
of working couples with children under
three increased by 56 percent; the pro-
portion of new houses having no more
than two bedrooms doubled, and the
average size of new housing units shrank-
by nineteen square feet; the number of
people living in a typical rental unit de-
clined by 13 percent, to 2.0, and the
number living in the average occupant-
owned unit declined by 16 percent, to
2.5; the number of miles Americans
traveled (including going to work) in-
creased by 631 billion; the amount of
money spent on fast food increased by
153 percent; membership in the Boy
Scouts and the Girl Scouts declined by
25 percent. The Abstract carries a _lot of Z
other suggestive data. It provides a rec-
ipe, so to speak, for cats. ‘

da scrub jay population stands a good chance of
bouncing back since it was declared a threatened
species, which makes it illegal to disturb the bll‘d
, or its eggs, a University of Florida zoology pro-
- ' fessor’ says.

“It’s a major step forward. I don’t see the loss
of thescrub jay in the near future,” said J.W.

Hardy, curator of birds at the Florida State Mu— ‘

seum at the University of Florida.

' The scrub jay, which resembles the blue jay,
but without a crest or hold markings, was listed
as a threatened species July 1 under the federal
Endangered Species Act.

There were an estimated 15,500 to 22,500
scrub jays in 1984, the latest year figures are
available. That is about half of the population 100
years ago, said Jeffrey Cox, who recently pub-
lished a book on the scrub jay.

- Hardy said anywhere from 11,900 to 18,900
birds could survive indefinitely with well-man—
aged, publicly owned sites designed to preserve
the bird’s natural habitat.

The scrub jay’s habitat is the Florida scrub,
which consists of sand-pine trees, various types

of shrubs and several kinds of small oaks, all of
which grow in white sand.

The scrub must be burned every five to seven
years to keep it from becoming too dense or tall
and scaring off the scrub jays.

“The bird is absolutely limited-to that kind of
habitat,” Hardy said.

The areas where the scrub and the jay pri-
marily exist are on Merritt Island and in the
Ocala National Forest.

But while the scrub jay can’t survive without
its natural environment, people generally do not
find the scrub appealing, Hardy said.

“The scrubby habitat is very easy to cut down
and is not awe-inspiring in appearance,” Hardy
said. “That makes it harder to convince people
that it’s worth saving.” _ " ‘

Much of what used to be scrub in Florida has
been replaced by housing or citrus groves, he
said.

“The state needs to try to educate the public, i
especially landowners, as to how the habitat
could be preserved,” Hardy said, adding that the
key to the scrub jay’s survival is state-owned sites
preserved by controlled burnings.

ALAMAZOO —- There are no signs that identi-
‘ fy the premises of Laboratory Research Enter-
: prises Inc., or Langshaw’s Farm near here. The
' visual anonymity is a security precaution; the
‘ products of LRE and Langshaw’s can be high in
j emotional Content.
LRE is the world’s largest breeder or dogs,
1., primarily beagles, for scientific research, and
Langshaw’s is one of the nation’s largest
producers of rabbits for the same purpose.

' The Kalamazoo area‘is an important center
for the produCtion of lab animals. Although LRE and
Langshaw’s were begun here because their founders hap-
pened to live in the area, a large rat-and-mice breeding facility
owned by Massachusetts-based Charles River Laboratories
owes its establishment to the proximity of the Upjohn Co.

Charles River, the General Motors of the lab animal
business, allows no outsiders in its facilities. For one reason,
said spokeswoman Barbara Kelley, visitors would increase
the chanCes for the virus antibody-free, genetiCally identical
rodents bred there to become contaminated. For another,
allowing visitors would “just give us extra visibility to people
who don’t think others should be in the business of doing that,
and who could create a security problem for us.”

Although anti-viviseCtionists adamantly oppose the use of
animals in researCh, scientists defend it as necessary, and a
large majority of the public apparently agrees with the latter.
An Associated Press poll last year indicated that 78 perCent of
Americans support the use of animals in biomedical research
and drug-safety testing. A survey conducted by the University
of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research in 1985 indicated
88 perCent of MiChigan residents are similarly convinced.

ACCORDING TO the US. Department of AgriCulture,
about 1.8 million animals -- not Counting mice, rats and birds
-— were used in scientific experiments last year. The figure
includes 176,000 dogs and 522,000 rabbits.

The US. Office of Technology Assessment, an arm of
Congress, estimates the number of all Creatures used at
between 17 million and 22 million —- the great bulk of them
(12 to 15 million) rats and mice. It estimates that the total has
_\ remained stable during the last. decade.

At LRE and Langshaw’s, the goal is to produCe dogs and
rabbits that are clean, healthy and as free as possible from
abnormalities. “You have to weed out the animal whose
mother nipped part of his ear off or who’s missing a toenail,”

said Langshaw’s owner Norman Langshaw. “You have to.

send out perfect animals.”

LRE IS A sprawling, fenced compound of 14 low, yellow
buildings with tidy lawns and bright gravel walkways
separating them. Giant exhausts, which change the air volume
in the buildings at least 10 times an hour, pump the odor of dog
outside.

Inside the climate-controlled structures are about 8,000
near-perfect specimens of dogs, kept dry, clean, inoculated,
distempered, wormed and well-fed. They are strangers to

mosquitoes and flies, thanks to regular spraying of the

buildings and grounds with insecticide, as well as to dogs from

the remainder is divided among mixed mongrels and five
breeds of hounds. . l

The dogs are kept in long rows of wire-mesh cages
(double-tiered for beagles, single-tiered for hounds) that
allow their wastes to drop onto stainless steel trays. From the
trays, the wastes regularly are hosed into floor sewer drains.

At the approach of a human, the dogs squirm excitedly and
send up a hoarse din of thin yips, the result of their vocal
chords having been snipped (under anesthetiC) to quiet their “
barks.

American Association for Laboratory
Animal Science, wear green lab cover-
alls. '
Preferred employes, said LRE presi-
dent Robert Denison, are people who
come “off the farm. ' . . . they have to be

animal lovers. They all have their o‘wn

dogs or dogs and cats and one or two
are show-dog raisers. You have to like
animals to work here.”

The beagle long has been prized by
researchers, Denison said. Madame Cu-
rie made extensive use of them. The
beagle, he said, “is a good dispositioned
dog; a compact, hardy dog which has
short hair and doesn’t shed.”

7 Whereas LRE’s hounds are used
primarily for cardiovascular surgical
research (because of their deep chests)
and orthopedics research (because of
their long bones), its beagles are used
almost exclusively for toxicity and
pharmacological testing. For such re-
search, Denison said, size is particular-
ly important. Large animals require
more space and food —- and larger

' ~ amounts of the often highly expensive

new substanCes being tested.

. ,. Size is a factor for which LRE’s
“brood stock” of about 2,500 dogs is

' constantly monitored. Broodstock

'bitches, which outnumber males 18-1,_

are weeded out for tendencies to

“throw" pups of non-standard size. .

They are retired, at the rate of 200 to
300 a year, for excessive age, inability
. . to nurse or tendencies to throw “choco-
lates” or “lemons” (beagle pups that
. . are brown-and-white or gold-and-
'1' white instead of the standard black-
hrown-and-white).

, , LRE’S GOAL is to turn out a uni-
, form product for its customers, one
that gives researchers “the advantage
,of administering an unknown com-
pound (the substance being tested) to a
known model,” Denison said.
‘ The company contends its dogs are,
for research purposes, superior to dogs
‘ acquired from pounds. Pound dogs
account for about 85 percent of the

dogs used for research in the United .

, States each year. Although pound dogs
are cheaper than LRE dogs, Denison
‘v-said, researchers must first go to the
time and expense of ridding them of

parasites and diseases before they are

usable. LRE dogs, he said, arrive essen;
tially ready for duty. -
Every LRE dog has a Computerized
record of its lineage and the medical
treatment it has undergone. To ensure

genetic distance, dogs bred together

must have no common ancestOrs for at‘
least five generations.

A newborn pup typically spends six
weeks in a cage with its mother and
littermates, then is weaned and tat-
tooed with an identification number in
its left ear. After weaning, it is moved
to a cage with two littermates, where it
lives until it is about 18 weeks old. By
that time, it will have been vaccinated
or dewormed eight times. . '

During this stage the dog is “social-
ized;” at least twiCe a week it is taken
out of its cage and hugged by an
employe called a “socializer.” The pro-
cess accustoms the dog to being han-
dled by humans, as it will be when it
reaChes the laboratory that buys it. It
also enables employes to closely moni-
tor the dog’s health, to listen to its
breathing and check its skin for rashes.

When this phase is nearly over, the
dog is “debarked” and placed in a cage
with one other dog. (If the dog is a
female destined for the brood colony,
she will have the same female cage-
mate for the rest of her life.)

LRE SHIPS about 8,000 dogs a year,

throughout the United States and to

0 Europe and Japan; most go when they

are five or six months old. The prices
the beagles Command range from $270
for a six-month-old, to $405 for a one-
year-old to $1,000 for a pregnant bitCh.
Prices for hounds and mongrels are,
respectively, $360 and $310 for a six-

.month-old, and $450 and $370 for a

one-year-old.

The dogs typically live another six
months to one year after leaving LRE.
After experimental regimens of drugs
or toxic agents or surgery, virtually all
are (in researCh parlance) “sacrificed,”
that is, put to sleep, so that their: tissues
can be studied. '

Between 150 and 250 of the dogs are '
used each year for research LRE does
under contract to various Customers.
Retired breeders, for example, are used
to test heart pacemakers, and for geri-
atric research. Some active breeders
test new veterinary medicines.

LRE is well regarded for its re-
search on periodontal disease, usually
done on retired breeders or other older
dogs. “The dog,” explained Martin
Gilman, a PhD toxicologist who is
LRE’s vice president for research, “is
the only model that mimics man in
plaque formation.

 




 

AT LANGSHAW’S, the atmosphere
. _ is much more that of a family farm than
laboratory.

Proprietors Norman and Diana
Langshaw and two employes keep
more than 6,000 Dutch, New Zealand
white and Florida white rabbits. The
Dutch rabbits are used primarily in
reproductive studies, the ultra-sensi-
‘ tive whites mostly in toxicology re-
search. “The New Zealands, in particu-
lar, are also harder to raise,” said
Langshaw. “They’re more tempera-
mental and susceptible to things going
wrong; they’re the first to get some-
thing if there’s something to get.”

’ The rabbits are housed in 11 large
barns, in wire mesh cages suspended’in
long rows several feet off the ground.
The barns’ translucent sides permit
natural light, which encourages breed-
ing, to enter during winter; in the
‘ spring, the sides are removed so that air
circulates easily among the cages.
Wastes fall through the mesh of the
cages and into wood chip-lined trench-
es below. Before a doe gives birth, her
cage is sterilized.

The health of the animals is man-

aged through rigorous sanitary con- -

trols rather than medicines. Unlike
with dogs, Langshaw said, there are no
vaccination regimens for rabbits; cus-
tomers prefer animals with no traces of
medicinal substances in their tissues.

LANGSHAW’S WAS started 16

years ago as a conventional rabbitry .

designed to produce meat. “Within a
year, we realized we were going
broke,” Langshaw said. “So, we had to
reach out and try to do research rab-
bits. It really worked, because there
was, at that time, a good flow of

researCh funds and labs were being .

built all over.”

Going into the research-animal
business meant giving each adolescent
and adult animal a Cage of its- own,
instead of keeping it with its litter-
mates (the change was made to keep
the animals from in-breeding and from
._ damaging and soiling one another.)
Increased competition from envi-
,ronmentally controlled rabbitries,
Ewhose animals are raised in sterile

environments, has changed Lang-- 3

Shaw’s status. It was once the largest
source of research rabbits in the United
States, with as many as 20,000 animals
on hand at a given time. Last year,
Langshaw’s shipped about 19,000 rab-
bits, compared to 35,000 in 1984.

An average Langshaw’s white rab- .

hit sells for about $25, an average
iiutch far about 330 Current sales,
ahout $200,000 a year, are half those of

 

 

a decade ago, but still qualify Lang-
shaw’s as one of the largest in its field.

FOR THE first six weeks of life, a
Langshaw’s rabbit is kept with its
mother (if a litter numbers more than
eight, the surplus is “fostered off” to
other does). After weaning, littermates
are kept together in a cage for another
two or three weeks, when they are
mature enough to be placed in single-
occupancy cages. A rabbit is full-
grown at five months.

A rabbit’s fate thereafter is deter-
mined largely by its type and sex.
Because Dutch rabbits are used primar-
ily in reproductive studies (which re-
quire females, impregnated in the lab),
all but a few Dutch bucks are slaugh-
tered for meat. Between 10 and 15
percent of white bucks, those judged
too far from the standard to ship to
customers for toxic'ological testing, are
also slaughtered.

Does kept as breeding stock, which
accounts for about 20 percent of the
total at Langshaw’s, produce an aver-
age of five litters a year, each litter
averaging eight kits. Most does go into

 

decline as producers after two years, ;
and are slaughtered for meat or sold for
research, although some have pro-
duced for five years and “kindled” 200
or more kits.

Research rabbitry is more profit- .
able than meat rabbitry. A five-pound
rabbit, after it is slaughtered and
dressed, brings only about $3.25. “Our
production costs,” said Langshaw, .
“are over twice what we get for a meat
rabbit.” The economics dictate that —
unreliable breeding does be culled rig— v;
orously. , - »

Thus a doe in heat who fails to get
pregnant after three visits to a buck is .
sold or slaughtered for meat. So are ,.
does who neglect their responsibilities
as mothers. ~

Rabbit No. 5774, a New Zealand
doe, was a case in point. Five days after
their birth, her entire litter was found
dead in the nest box. “She just aban- _
cloned them, didn’t want them around,”
Langshaw said. “A month from now, if .
she does that again —— all of them dead
-- she’s not even going to get a third .
try, as she normally would; she’s
meat.” ' ‘

Westbrook residents describe attacks

By LOU JAKOVAC
and KRISTIN JACOBSEN
Post Reporters

 

For Isaac Miller, the final blow
came when his 9-month-old Ger-
man shepherd was mauled to death
last week inside a fenced-in back
yard in southwest Houston.

The culprits in the July 27 inci-
dent were pit bull terriers, the
Westbrook subdivision resident
said. .

Gary Smith, another Westbrook
resident, said he saw a neighbor’s
Golden Labrador barely escape the
jaws of two pit bulls in the early
morning hours two weeks ago.

Both men pleaded Wednesday
with Houston’s City Council for
more stringent laws over animals
or, more precisely, over their own-
ers. The running count in West—
brook, Miller says, is at least three
dogs dead and seven injured.

“Do the individual people have
to take the law in their own
hands?” said an embittered Miller
of the 4700 block of Smooth Oak.

Partly spurred by the plea,
Councilman John Goodner reacti—
vated the council’s animal control
committee with the consent of
Mayor Kathy Whitmire. Goodner,
the committee chairman, said revi-
sions are desperately needed in
Houston’s animal control law.

“I don’t care if it’s a '4-pound
Chihuahua or a 300-pound St. Ber—
nard, if they show tendencies to-

-. pad-J *—.

ward this (violence), there should
be more control,” Goodner said af-
ter the council meeting.

City animal control officers took
two pit bull terriers this week from
a neighbor of J m,
Miller and t"
Smith. Misde-
meanor war-
rants for fail-
ing to obtain
rabies vacci-
nations or a ,
city license for
a pit bull were
issued in April
against the
dogs’ owner, PARKER:

22:?! ET: Segre- Defends dogs

city’s Bureau of Animal Regulation
and Care.

The dogs’ owner, Dorothy
Parker of the 4700 block of Pine-
brook, told authorities her two pit
bulls did not attack other animals.
According to Sargent, Parker
signed a release that allows city of-
ficials to kill the dogs.

ButParker said Wednesday the
dogs, which she said belonged to
her 26-year-old son, should not be
destroyed. One of the 2-year-old
pit bulls has gotten out once and
fought with another dog, she said,
but the other dog was not seriously
injured.

She maintains the dogs are not
vicious. If they were, Parker said,
she would have gotten rid of them.

 

 

  

“l have grandchildren Why
would I want a dog that would at
tack little children and things?"
Parker said.

Houston’s animal control law es:
sentially gives dogs and other ani-V g;
mals two chances: “It gives them,

one free bite. It’s the second inci-

dent before we can get to court,”

Goodner said. The law, he said, ba-

sically is only a leash law, preVent, ;
ing animals from roaming the city;

Goodner plans to draft a report
for the council committee, he said,

and eventually conduct hearings
on changes. In essence, he said he

forsees a law where animal attacks

against humans or other animals P H
result in stringent fines and confis— 5d

cations.

Sargent is compiling statistics on 4
animal attacks in Houston, but she '

said nationwide there are about 1

million cases of dogs biting people ,I: _ ' "
annually. Officials estimate, how- - _,
ever, that only one in 20 cases are , '

reported, she said.

The Houston animal control bu~

reau, Sargent said, receives about

600 complaints daily. Despite the f
absence of attacks against humans . '
in the Westbrook subdivision,
Smith said he is fearful. an attack. _ a? .
“The other day I saw a pack of git , ,
eight to 10 dogs roaming around. I i
couldn’t believe it,” Smith said. “It

was in an area where kids wait for
the school bus. Now the dogs

didn’t bother them none, but you

can’t bank on that.”

Doggone condo rules
0 . O O O
quite biting at times
I, gain today, we take you to the
wonderful world of South Florida
condominiums. .
This is a tale that has all the condo

. elements: a couple of elderly people; a
dog in violation of condo bylaws; an attorney. It’s
all there.

The main characters are Zygmant and Sally
Soroka, natives of Poland, who for the last eight
years have been living at Ramblewood East, a
1,020—unit condo complex in Coral Springs.

The condo has a policy against dogs, unless you
had the pet when you bought from the original
developer when you moved in. After that dog dies,
you can’t get another.

The Sorokas did not have a dog when they moved
in, but their 31-year-old son, Arthur, gave his
father a miniature schnauzer named Seymour
several months ago.

Predictably, Zygmant Soroka has gotten quite
attached to the dog.

Also predictably, somebody in the condo found
out about the dogand complained to the condo
board, which is telling Soroha to get rid of the pet
or be prepared to spend a lot of bucks in court. '

This is your basic condo conflict, with one
additional element — 76-year-old Zygmant Soroka
is legally blind. '. ‘ ‘ ..

' Dog is a help, but . . . ' . g,

It was two years ago that Arthur, who was living
in Orlando at the time, bought the dog. He trained
it for well more than a year before giving it to his
parents. - . , a .

“I would come Over for visits,” explained Arthur,
who lives in Coral Springs, “and my mother '
wouldn’t be home, and my father [who is also hard
of hearing] couldn’t hear anybody come to the door.
I saw what was going on. I wanted a dog as an
aide. My father can’t hear anybody unless the dog
scratches and lets him know somebody’s there.

“I didn’t think there would be a problem.”

Zygmant is able to make out images, and seems
to get around OK in his condo. But he says the dog
has been a big help at the times when he is alone. ‘

“If I have the dog, I don’t feel so lonesome,” he
said. “I feel pleasure.” 5 - , .4» » ..
Ah, but condominium living means condominium
1 330331611“. Which, in this case, means Seymour is

“I cannot permit selective enforcement,” said

‘ Sol Gerstler, president of the condo association

board. Gerstler provided documents showing that

Soroka also had gotten involved in a condo spat at

i

Ramblewood involving a dog five years ago, before
? the pet was removed. ; ’
“We’re sworn to uphold the’ rules and regulations
of the condominium,” condo board member Nat ,
Holender said. “[Zygmant] doesn’t want an aide . . .
he wants a pet.” . 1 ~ -

Seymour’s the wrong dog

, The ironic part of the situation is that if Soroka
had a Seeing Eye dog -— a dog obviously much

' larger and much noisier than Seymour —- he would
legally be allowed to keep it in the condo, and
there would be no problem at all.

_, “That would take everybody in the condo off the
hook,” Sands said. '

But, according to Dolores Henley of the Division

’ of Blind Services, Seeing Eye dogs aren’t used in
. cases like this. -

“To get a guide dog, yen have to be active. . . .

They’re not meant as pets,” said Hanley, who has
' worked with the Sorolras.

“[Zygmant] stays inside all the tune. A guide dog

I is for people going to school, to work, who have to

cross streets. A guide dog isn’t appropriate. He

. wouldn’t get one.”

Seymour seems to be taking all of this in stride.
But I have a hunch that very soon, to avoidithe
hellacious legal fees that commonly occur in such
cases, the dog will wind up living with Zygmant’s

. son, Arthur. . '

; Seymour will thus iearn :3 iconic-fart of South

. Florida life -— it is easzei‘ to tight Cit}. Hail than to

HOW IR “RIC, {Hall “135 the laSt “animal” '3
60d created 33d it seems he’s determined to

be the last to leave the Earth.

How very clever, importing several young
falcons under the guise of proteCting or
multiplying the species. Anyone with half a
brain would know that they’re planted there
to get rid of the small birds and pigeons. For
birding people, the pleasure of feeding the
birds didn’t work, so now they have come up
with another idea. Well, I guess it’s better
than the annual pigeon shoot they hold in
other parts of the country, or is it? Looks to
me the animals and wildlife are taking a

beating.

~ As Mahatma Gandhi once said, you can
judge the progress of a nation by the way its
animals are treated. That would apply to all

living things, also.
