WILL OUR COUNTRY ACCEPT ITS
DOLPHIN PROTECTION
RESPONSIBILITIES?

“The hunting of Dolphins is immoral and that man can no
more draw nigh the gods as a welcome sacrificer nor touch their
altars with clean hands but pollutes those who share the same
roof with him, whoso willingly devises destruction for Dolphins.
For equally with human slaughter, the gods abhor the deathly
doom of the monarchs of the deep . . . ” Oppian

If we accept the wisdom of the Ancients as expressed by Op-
pian, immorality is rife in the United States and Japan.

The government of Nagasaki even provided a “Dolphin
Processor” to Iki Island to chop up the dolphins deliberately
captured and slaughtered on their migratory path in late Febru-
ary and early March.

The US. government has scheduled hearings before an ad-
ministrative law judge to examine the findings of the scientific
workshop which determined that offshore spotted dolphins, the
species most often set upon by tuna purse seine fishermen, are
depleted. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, depleted
species may not be taken. The tuna industry is preparing to
argue the case strongly. ‘

The only way a final solution can be reached is to use a dif-
ferent method for locating and setting the seines on schools of
tuna. The best hope lies with fish aggregating devices. These
have been successfully used in Hawaiian waters and are now
the subject of a proposal for a statewide fish aggregation
system, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service.
They have already brought about a substantial reduction in
scouting time and pursuit of tuna schools because the fish tend
to stay round the anchored rafts from which forty foot pieces of
net hang free in the water. It is a remarkable fact that fish and
other marine organisms are attracted to such foreign objects. It
has been reported that even an old rain coat ﬂoating on the sur-
face has attracted fish; oil drums have been set out successfully
to aggregate them and floating trunks of dead palm trees are
well known to fishermen who have used them for “log fishing”
for many years.

A proposal to research both aggregating devices and
methods of locating schools of tuna fish not associated with
dolphins, has been prepared by Frank Awbrey and William
Evans, scientists from the University of San Diego and Hubbs-
Sea World respectively. This carefully prepared work should be
implemented immediately by industry and government to elim-
inate the pursuit of dolphin herds and setting of the giant purse
seines around them.

The purse seine fishery is now known to all the dolphin herds
in the Eastern tropical Pacific, and as soon as they perceive a
seiner, the whole dolphin school starts to “run”, swimming and
leaping at top speed. The speedboats deployed by the big $5-
million purse seiners must now be equipped with extra fuel
tanks for their ruthless pursuit of the dolphins. The chases
which used to last one to two hours now are extended to three
or four hours before the exhausted dolphins are able to “run”
no more, and they are encircled in the seines. Such prolonged
chases cannot be sustained by the old, the weak, or diseased,
the very young or the pregnant dolphins. Death from exhaus-
tion is likely to follow such persistent pursuit, thus, causing more
damage to populations that are either depleted or likely to
become so.

The cruelty of the chase has enormously intensified as the
dolphins have learned that they must do their very best to avoid
tuna seiners. At the same time, the cost of the chase in fuel and
time spent continues to rise. Thus, selfish and altruistic motives
combine to demand the discovery of a tuna fishing method
which does not depend on dolphins.

Compliance with federal law, the Marine Mammal Protection
Act, likewise calls for a goal approaching zero mortality and
serious injury rate.

The Act’s definition of “taking” includes harassment of mar-
ing mammals. The harassment meted out by the multimillion

THE KELLERT REPORT

The extent to which the general public is willing to put wild
animals ahead of purely economic considerations has susprised
many cynics when they read phase I of a Yale School of For-
estry and Environmental Studies survey: “Public Attitudes
Toward Critical Wildlife and Natural Habitat Issues.” The study,
funded by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, was con-
ducted in a highly professional and extremely thorough manner
showing close correlation with the US. census with regard to
age, sex, race, and occupation.

The 138-page study covers a broad area. Some of the ques-
tions of particular interest to readers of the Information Report
include views on endangered species, predator control, use of
the steel jaw leghold trap, and poisons.

When asked which of a list of endangered species they would
be willing to protect even if it resulted in higher costs for an
energy development project, 89% favored protection for the
bald eagle, 73% for the mountain lion, 71% for the Agassiz
trout, 70% for the American crocodile and 64% for the Silver-
spot butterfly.

When asked whether they would approve poisoning of coy-
otes because it is the least expensive solution even though
other animals besides coyotes may be killed, 92% of the
general public disapproved. However, when sheep producers
were asked the same question 75% approved.

The general public and the sheepmen were also diametrically
opposed though not to quite such an extreme degree, on the
question as to whether cattle and sheep grazing should be lim-
ited on publicly owned lands if it destroys plants needed by
wildlife even though this may result in higher meat costs. Sixty
percent of the general public agreed, and 59% of the sheep-
men disagreed.

The public expressed its willingness to pay higher prices for
tuna fish if this resulted in fishermen killing fewer porpoises in
their nets. Sixty-nine percent were prepared to make a financial
sacrifice to protect dolphins.

With regard to the steel jaw leghold trap the study shows
78% of the general public oppose use of the steel jaw leghold
trap to capture wild animals.

 




 

DOLPHINS Continued

dollar U.S. tuna fleet is far more severe than any other marine
mammal receives at the hands of American citizens, and it in-
volves tens of thousands of dolphins chased, set upon, and
released when the tuna seiner backs down to let the dolphins
out of the nets before the tuna are hauled on board.

The tuna industry, after four separate lawsuits were won by
environmental and humane groups, reduced the numbers of
dolphins killed and injured before release from the seines, but
they have not reduced the number chased and held in the nets
prior to release.

The issue now is the chase, the suffering and death it inflicts,
and the need to end dependency on the dolphin herds to locate
yellow fin tuna.

If the Awbrey-Evans proposal is promptly funded and im-
plemented, and if it leads to development of efficient fishing
methods without harassment of dolphins, it will solve the US.
tuna fleet’s problems and carry over to seiners of other nations.
This is important, for though the seiners are still preponderantly
American, they have become popular with other countries too.

Venezuela, the Congo, New Zealand, Senegal, and Spain
have informed their vessel operators that they must fish in ac-
cordance with US. law and follow dolphin release procedures
required of US. operators (San Diego Law Review, April,

1979). Senegal volunteered to be bound by US. quotas and to
cease setting on any species for which the quotas have been
reached. . .

Under the heading of “The Responsibility of the United
States in International Programs,” (Ibid.), Laurel Lee Hyde
writes, “In addition to the moratorium on imported yellowfin
under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the United
States could ban the importation of all tunafish products from
any State whose nationals fish in a manner that diminishes the
effectiveness of an international fishery conservation program
under the Pelly amendment. The amendment’s broad defini-
tion of international fishery agreements includes international
programs for cetacean conservation. Thus, the United States
may ban not only all yellowfin imports but all other fish -product
imports as well from any State that frustrates the purpose of an
international program to protect the dolphin and to reduce their
incidental kill in tuna industry. The invocation of these trade
sanctions does not demand that a species or stock be in danger
of extinction or that a treaty be violated. The offending party
need not even be a party to the conservation program it is
hindering. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion (NOAA) has used the Pelly amendment to encourage
non-International Whaling Commission (IWC) States to join the
IWC or at least to comply with IWC regulations. It could active-
ly be used in connection with the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission’s (IATTC) attempts to internationalize dolphin
protection if the United States decides to accept fully the
responsibilities imposed by the MMPA.”

SAVING SEA TURTLES

A world Conference on Sea Turtle Conservation was held in
the US. Department of State November 26—30 and attracted
turtle scientists, representatives of turtle products industries,
government officials, and environmentalists. At the conclusion
of the 4-day meeting, a turtle conservation policy was unani-
mously adopted; and the International Union for the Conserva-
tion of Nature was put in charge of implementing it.

The conservation strategy was prepared by Dr. David Ehren-
feld, a turtle scientist of broad interests who holds an MD.
Degree from Harvard University and wrote The Arrogance of
Humanism (Oxford University Press, 1978). Emphasizing that
the goal is the ending of international trade in all sea turtle
products, the strategy singles out four of the most immediate
priorities: (1) the leather trade, a new industry which constitutes
an intolerable drain on the sea turtle populations, especially L.
oliuacea (Olive Ridley); (2) trade in stuffed baby sea turtles; (3)
eggs collected for sale in distant markets; and (4) trade in tor-
toiseshell.

The incidental catch of sea turtles is described as a major
threat to many sea turtle populations. “All countries,” the strat-
egy states, “should be prepared to establish restricted fishing
zones in areas of high turtle concentration . . .The development
of trawls that exclude sea turtles should be given high priority.”

Other matters covered in the conservation strategy include
Habitat Destruction and Pollution, Conservation Education,
Regulations, Laws and Treaties, and Enforcement.

SCIENCE FAIR MONITORING
KIT OFFERED

lnhumane biology projects involving animals conducted by
young students for science fairs have been a constant problem
for many years. For instance, a recent prize-winning high school
student project at the International Science and Engineering
Fair involved cutting off the legs and tails of a lizard to demon—
strate the well-known fact that tails regrow and legs don’t.

If you would like to actively participate in a campaign to
reduce the incidence of such improper student projects, the
Scientists Center for Animal Welfare has a “Science Fair Moni-
toring Kit” which explains what you can do. For copies of the
kit, write to the Scientists Center for Animal Welfare, PO. Box

CEQ DOCUMENTS ORV’s DEADLY I-IAVOC

Motorcycles, dune buggies, snowmobiles and other off-road
vehicles (ORV’s) are causing irreversible damage to public
lands and disrupting the activities of wildlife, domestic animals
and human hikers, campers, and skiers who use the land. Mil:
lions of people roar through woods, fields, dunes and deserts
on ORV’s with little restriction, despite executive order 1 1989’s
unequivocal statement; “the respective agency head shall,
whenever he determines that the use of off-road vehicles will
cause or is causing considerable adverse effects on the soil,
vegetation, wildlife, wildlife habitat or cultural or historic
resources of particular areas or trails of the public lands, im-
mediately close such areas or trails to the type of off-road vehi-
cle causing such effects, until such time as he determines that
such adverse effects have been eliminated and that measures
have been implemented to prevent future recurrence.”

The Council on Environmental Quality has recently pub-
lished an 84-page report on the ORV problem, Off-Road Vehi-
cles on Public Land. Under Environmental Costs the report
states, “It is because ORV’s attack that relatively thin layer of
disintegrated rock and organic material to which all earthly life
clings—soil—that they can have such a devastating effect on
natural resources . . . and what happens when ORV’s strip away
the entire soil mantle, leaving exposed bedrock, as they have
done in numerous spots in California? Then recovery will take
millennia . . . They collide with animals, especially smaller mam-
mals and reptiles. By destroying vegetation, they are also
destroying animal food and shelter. In addition, ORV’s afford
hunters and fishermen access to remote, heretofore untouched
areas, thereby dramatically increasing the fish and game kills in
those areas.”

Under “The Impact of Snowmobiles” we find, “Jack Hope
reports: ‘At 80-acre Pierz Lake in Minnesota, where summer
canoeists were once rewarded for their six-hour paddle with a
catch of a two-pound trout, a troop of 120 snowmobiles virtual-
ly cleaned out the lake in a single winter’s day, packing out 556
pounds of fish.’ ”

As for birds, the report notes, “In Anderson Valley, an undis-
turbed area had twice the bird biomass and number of species
and 1.5 times the number of birds as a similar area of ‘mod-
erate’ ORV use.”

VIEWS OF A NOBEL LAUREATE
ON FACTORY FARMING

George Wald, Professor of Biology Emeritus, Harvard Uni-
versity, Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine, 1967, has
written AWI giving his permission to publish his opinion on the
extreme confinement and other deprivations suffered by live-
stock and poultry on factory farms.

Professor Wald states: “Never before in human history have
the animals that bring meat to the table been subjected to such
cruelties as in present factory procedures. Always heretofore
animals raised for meat have lived some degree of normal ani-
mal lives up to the dreadful day of slaughter. But a few years
ago the realization began to be exploited that an animal allowed
to move thereby grows and fattens more slowly. Hence, every-
thing now is done to see to it that animals move as little as
possible during their entire lives. Either they are fastened in
stanchions, or boxed in narrow stalls, or packed in pens or feed-
lots so that they can hardly move. Chickens are so crowded
throughout their lives as to be unable to move about. That irri-
tates them so that they try to peck one another; but that would
spoil their skins. So they are de-beaked; and if allowed to live
long enough, may be de-beaked again. In part, to reject such
brutalities my family has gone semi-vegetarian. We permit our-
selves fish and invertebrates—clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops:
animals that live free until taken. But we find it neither hard nor
unhealthful to do without meat altogether.”

PROGRESS TOWARD REPLACING THE
STEEL JAW LEGI-IOLD TRAP

Tests show that the leg snare trap, developed by the Ontario
Ministry of Natural Resources, is capable of bringing about a
major reduction in serious injuries to captured animals.

In a letter to New York Assemblywoman Florence Sullivan,
sponsor of a bill to restrict the steel jaw leghold trap, Mr. L. H-
Eckel, Executive Coordinator of Outdoor Recreation for the
province of Ontario wrote, “We extensively field tested this new
trap in 1978 and compared it to the leghold trap. The Capture
rates for the live-trap and leghold traps were identical at 71 per-
cent each. The live-trap captured fewer skunks as compared to
the leghold trap, 28 vs. 96 percent. Six percent of the captured
animals escaped from the live—trap and 7 percent from the leg.-
holds. None of the animals captured in the live-trap were sen-
ously injured (cuts, chewed feet, broken bones, etc.) whereas 43
percent of the animals caught in the legholds were. Eighty-
seven percent of the animals captured in the liveotrap were
caught above the pads as compared to 34 percent captured in
the leghold. The live-traps were set a total of 1457 trap—nights
and the legholds a total of 746 trap-nights. A total of 190




animals discharged the live-traps and 74 animals discharged the
legholds.

The Ontario government is seeking a patent so the new trap
can be manufactured and marketed.

NATIONAL ADVISORY EYE
COUNCIL POLICY STATEMENT

Procedures to Assure Freedom from Pain in
Experiments upon Cold-Blooded Vertebrates
Adopted October 25, l 979

Issue

The new policy (“Responsibility for Care and Use of Ani-
mals”) on humane care and use of vertebrate animals under
NIH-supported grants, contracts, and other awards, appeared in
the November 10, 1978 issue of the NIH Guide for Grants and
Contracts. At recent meetings of the National Advisory Eye
Council, this policy was discussed in terms of providing ade-
quate guidance on humane care and use of cold-blooded lower
vertebrates, which are used extensively for vision research.

Background

It was agreed in these discussions that the new policy state-
ment on “Responsibility for Care and Use of Animals” provides
essential guidance to research scientists, institutional and peer
review groups, NIH program staff, and the NIH Office for the
Protection from Research Risks, on the humane care and use of
vertebrate animals under NIH awards. This guidance probably
suffices for most purposes, since there is a long history of atten-
tion by biological scientists to the conditions which assure that
experimental work is conducted under pain-free conditions,
especially in mammals. However, the new policy statement
provides no guidance on the special problems involved in the
humane care and use of cold-blooded lower vertebrates, which
appear in particular need of further consideration.

Since it has sometimes been assumed that cold-blooded ver-
tebrates do not experience pain, this question needs to be
addressed. Being an important adaptive survival mechanism,
pain is probably a primitive mechanism that appeared early in
evolution. Also, the continuity of vertebrate evolution makes it
extremely unlikely that pain first appeared in mammals. It is
likewise relevant that functional continuity among vertebrates is
commonly assumed in using cold-blooded vertebrates to obtain
results that may be applied to mammals, and especially to
humans. Since this assumption is demonstrably reasonable for
many of the research problems that prompt the use of cold-
blooded vertebrates, it would seem unreasonable to assume at
the same time that cold-blooded vertebrates do not feel pain.
This is a subject upon which proof is lacking, and definitive evi—
dence cannot be foreseen in the near future. But even a cursory
review reveals strong reasons for believing that cold-blooded
vertebrates do experience pain. Hence prudence requires that
these animals receive at least the same consideration as mam-
mals, if undue suffering is to be prevented.

In fact, if cold-blooded vertebrates experience pain, it is par-
ticularly important to strive for pain-free conditions during ex-
periments upon them. This is partly because cold-blooded ver-
tebrates are often used in research to avoid undesirable effects
of the anesthetics that are required in mammalian work. Also,
the nervous systems of cold-blooded vertebrates continue to
function for long periods after procedures that would quickly
kill mammalian nerve cells. This is another reason why cold-
blooded vertebrates are used so extensively in research. But
prolonged survival also means, for example, that if a frog or tur-
tle is decapitated, the decapitated head may be capable of ex-
periencing pain for several hours. In short, one of the main
reasons for using cold—blooded vertebrates can also place these
animals at particular risk of suffering. Since these animals pro-
vide us with much useful information, and have no choice in
this matter, there is a clear responsibility to prevent such suffer-
mg.

It is believed that these background considerations are
already familiar to, and accepted by, most persons who are con-
cerned with humane experimentation upon cold-blooded ver-
tebrates. But it is also believed important to clarify the policy of
the National Advisory Eye Council on these points.

Recommendation

Since a great deal of vision research is conducted upon cold-
blooded lower vertebrates, the National Advisory Eye Council
believes that, for research supported by the NEI, effective and
uniform procedures should be adopted to minimize pain in
these animals. In many cases this can be done very easily with
no Compromise to the advantages of working with cold-blood-
ed vertebrates. For much research in vision, the first step is
decapitation. Following decapitation, unless the experiment re-
Quires an intact brain, the National Advisory Eye Council rec-
ommends that the brain be destroyed immediately by pithing
thrOUQh the spinal cord. This procedure is already done in
many laboratories, and should be done consistently, regardless

ﬁt Whether any further operative work is performed upon the
ead.

REGULATIONS FOR 1978 HUMANE
SLAUGHTER ACT INCLUDE
PRE-SLAUGHTER HANDLING

The 1978 amendments to the Federal Humane Slaughter
Act of 1958 are at last in force. Final regulations published in
the November 30, 1979 Federal Register were summarized in a
bulletin issued January 29, 1980 for the US. Department of
Agriculture’s regional directors and supervisors and distributed
to all involved.

The major changes in the law are 1) Coverage of all animals
in federally inspected plants 2) coverage from the time they
arrive at the plant with regard to handling and care 3) powerful
incentive to packers to treat animals humanely because of
potential large monetary losses when federal inspection is sus-
pended (no slaughter allowed) because of inhumane practices
and 4) requirement that imported meat be from humanely
slaughtered animals.

A few quotations from the USDA. bulletin follow:

“The Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1978 makes
humane slaughtering and handling mandatory for all cattle,
sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, and other equines slaugh-
tered under inspection at federally inspected plants . . . The
humane stunning and slaughtering provisions contained in Part
390 are now mandatory for all livestock, except those being
slaughtered ritually, under the Humane Methods of Slaughter
Act of 1978 . . . Handling Requirements. The animals shall be
handled humanely in the livestock pens and while being driven
to and from the pens. Driving of livestock shall be accomplished
with a minimum of excitement and discomfort to the animals.
With respect to permitted driving implements, determination of
the humaneness of a driving implement lies as much in the way
it is used as in the implement itself. However, metal pipes and
sharp pointed objects shall not be permitted. Electric prods, can-
vas slappers, or other implements used to drive animals shall be
employed as little as possible to minimize excitement and injury
to the livestock being driven. All livestock shall have access to
water. Feed shall be supplied if livestock are to be held more
than 24 hours before being slaughtered. There shall be suffi-
cient room in the pens for animals held overnight to lie down.
Electronic prods which are connected to AC house current shall
be reduced by a transformer to the lowest effective voltage not
to exceed 50 volts AC. There is some evidence that voltages as
low as 20 volts AC are effective.

“Downer animals shall not be dragged. In some instances,
immediate slaughter may be the most humane thing to do, in
which case the animal shall be given ante-mortem inspection
and then stunned before moving it.

“Pens, driveways, and ramps shall be kept in good repair to
prevent injury to the livestock. Sharp objects, loose, splintered,
or broken boards and other pain producing objects shall be
eliminated or repaired. Pen floors and alleyways shall be slip
resistant. Sand may be used to provide livestock with a more
secure footing, especially during winter months . . .

“Whenever a violation of the Humane Methods of Slaughter
Act occurs and operations are stopped, the inspector in charge
shall notify plant management of the reasons for taking action.
If the situation is corrected and the problem resolved at the es-
tablishment level, operations may resume. Report the incident
to the Area Supervisor. If the matter cannot be resolved at the
establishment level, refer plant management to the next level of
supervision.”

Commenting in The Federal Register on complaints from in-
dustry about the loss of funds which a plant could suffer when
operations are suspended under the law, U.S.D.A.’s Adminis-
trator of Food, Safety, and Quality Service stated: “The prin-
cipal purpose of the Act is to deter and prevent inhumane treat-
ment, not to punish for violations. Furthermore, the temporary
suspension of inspection for inhumane handling or slaughter
would be done in the same manner as the temporary suspen-
sion of inspection because of sanitation deficiencies. The use of
the ‘US Rejected’ tag would similarly have the same function
and meaning as when used on insanitary equipment. It may be
removed by the inspector in charge when the cause is corrected
or satisfactory assurances are given.”

ICLA RECOMMENDS AVOIDANCE OF
DUPLICATION OF TOXICITY TESTS FROM
ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER

At the January 1979 meeting of the Governing Board of the
International Committee on Laboratory Animals a resolution
was passed expressing support for animal experimentation
while drawing attention to means whereby significant reduc-
tions in the numbers of animals used have been or could be
achieved.

According to the Canadian Association for Laboratory Ani-
mal Science Newsletter (vol. 11, No. 5, Oct., 1979), “Lab-
oratory animal technology, which has done much to advance
the health of experimental animals particularly when allied to
statistical analysis, also has led to significant reductions in the
number of animals used.

“A further considerable reduction in the numbers of animals
used would follow if national regulatory authorities could be
persuaded to revise the number of animals used in toxicity test-
ing and avoid duplications from one country to another.”

 




TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH IN
PREVENTING WILDLIFE DEATHS BY
AUTOMOBILES

The Austrian Academy of Science has confirmed the highly
successful results of an investigation by the Institute of Com-
parative Behavior on reduction of road accidents involving
animals. Animal behavior theory was put into practice by a
company that manufactures optical devices. Reflectors were
devised for placement 10 or 20 yards apart, giving the appear-
ance of reflected, red eyes glowing in the dark. Thus, animals’
natural inborn fear of predators is translated, in behavioral
terms, to the fear they need to feel of an oncoming motor vehi-
cle if collisions are to be avoided. Automobiles have been dead-
ly to wildlife because there has been no way to inform animals
of the dangerous speed and power of a phenomenon which
has had no place in the evolution of any species. The eyes of
predators, on the other hand, are instantly recognized as signal-
ling danger. It is a universal language.
Because the car headlights strike a number of the reflectors,
many “eyes” flare up instantly, thus producing an “optical
fence”. The result has been a decrease of 80% of collisions with

animals after dark in Austrian roads equipped with these reflec-

tors.

“Swareflex” wildlife reflectors are available in the United
States from the Strieter Corporation, 2100 Eighteenth Avenue,
Rock Island, Ill. 61201. The Company describes the effect of
the reflectors thus: “The headlights of approaching vehicles
strike the wildlife reflectors which are installed on both sides of
the road. Unnoticeable to the driver, these reflect red lights into
the adjoining terrain and an optical warning fence is produced.
Any approaching wildlife is alerted and stops or returns to the
safety of the countryside. Immediately after the vehicle has
passed, the reflectors become inactive, thereby permitting the
animals to cross safely.”

It is noted that thousands of miles of European roads where
deer frequently cross have been made safe with these reflec-
tors. In Austria alone, 300,000 reflectors have been installed.
Furthermore, unlike fixed fences which interrupt the accus-
tomed paths of wildlife, the optical warning fence is activated
only when a vehicle approaches.

Although the driver does not see the reflection, animals of all
kinds and sizes approaching the road do. Due to the large angle
of dispersion of these wildlife reflectors, spacing up to 66 feet on
straight parts of highways is effective.

Otto Koenig, in an essay on the importance of eyes and eye
symbols, notes that red is the most important “alarm color” for
men and other vertebrates. Humans react most definitely to
round red stop lights. Primitive man frequently used eye repre-
sentatives and symbols on his dwellings. A number of animals
from moths to hawks have representations of eyes to aid them
in survival, the moths on their wings, the hawks on the backs of
their heads.

At a conference of the Austrian Automobile Association in
1965 on prevention of accidents to wildlife, Dr. Koenig sug-
gested mounting red warning reflectors in eye patterns on both
sides of the road. Sources of light arranged by pairs would sug-
gest the eyes of predators, he said. Dr. Koenig was asked by the
Swarovski Company whether wildlife could really see the color
red, since hunters had insisted that animals were color blind. He
provided substantial documentation and common observation
to the contrary.‘

The results of tests attracted the attention of Austrian hunting
federations and traffic engineers, and in recorded checks of 30
kilometers of particularly dangerous areas for animal crossings
233 animals were killed each year before the wildlife reflectors
were installed, and afterwards this number decreased to 55
animals per annum (roughly a decrease of 80%). On some of
the test sections there were no more accidents with animals at
all after the reflectors were installed.

It is estimated that installation of the reflectors pays off within
approximately six months through reduction of wildlife acci-
dents in areas where these are prevalent. They are much
cheaper than fences.

The Animal Welfare Institute is requesting the United States
Department of Transportation to encourage use of reflectors to

WORLD CONSERVATION STRATEGY
LAUNCHED IN 32 NATIONS

The World Conservation Strategy, its fourth and final draft in
nent, was launched simultaneously by the International Union
the hands of governments and private groups on every conti-
for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources on
March fifth with ceremonies in Australia, Barbados, Belgium,
Brazil, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, Dominican
Republic, England, Finland, France, Germany, Grenada, Hong
Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, The
Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Thailand, Venezuela, United States, and Zambia.

In Washington, the Secretary General of the Organization of
American States Alejandro Orfila was host to the hundreds
who came to hear Russell Train, President of the World Wildlife
Fund/United States, Cecil Andrus, Secretary of the Interior,
former President Oduber of Costa Rica and other distinguished
conservationists speak.

Senator John Chafee (R., RI) announced introduction of his
bill to assist wildlife on an international basis. He said, in part:
“No one nation is the sole arbiter of its natural resources. One
country’s loss of habitat might trigger a decline in a migratory
species of unique inportance far beyond the boundaries of that
land. To turn that around, one nation’s gain in conservation is
everyone’s gain.

“In the spirit of today’s celebration, I wish to announce an ef-
fort on which we in the United States Congress are embarking.

“Nowhere among the world’s declining natural resources is
there a more extreme case than in the area of wildlife and the
habitat upon which it must depend. We may attempt to deal
with such problems as a species decline or disappearance
through trade laws and such, but the quagmire is much deeper
and so must be our approach.

“I was dismayed at the tragedy of our wildlife resources high-
lighted during recent hearings of our Senate Environment
Committee. We see species gradually disappearing from the
earth. Loss of habitat vital to wildlife, such as tropical rain
forests, is a dangerous threat to many forms of wildlife around
the globe. Two scourges of the world environment, deforesta-
tion and desertification, are taking a high toll on this precious
resource.

“I will leave here today to go back to the Senate to introduce
bipartisan legislation which would enable the United States to
extend international assistance in wildlife resource conservation
and management. The bill represents the kind of initiatives we
are fueling here with the launch of the World Conservation
Strategy. It is positive in its approach. Among its features is an
international conservation corps whereby experts from our
country can assist other nations in developing their capability to
manage their living natural resources. We would also make
available training opportunities in wildlife conservation for
representatives from other countries, so that they could attend
higher education or research institutions or take part in other
conservation training courses here in the United States.
Resource attaches would be stationed in up to ten key regions
around the world as liaisons for the gathering of needed conser-
vation information.

“I challenge the countries and organizations represented here
today, and indeed all those involved in the World Conservation
Strategy, to match our offer. Make a commitment to turn the
tide on the deterioration of our wildlife and its habitat. It doesn’t
take a lot of money. I have a hard time thinking of an effort
where the benefits would be greater for the modest amounts
spent. Join with us in a truly international conservation corps.
Who says the United States has a corner on the market of wild-
life conservation corps. We are talking about creativity here . . .
and no nation or organization will admit to being short on crea-
tivity! -

“Let us all sow together the seeds for assuring that man does
not become a species who contemplates himself . . . by himself.”

Senator Chafee’s bill includes several of the basic provisions
of the House-passed elephant protection bill, urgently needed
to prevent the current poaching and smuggling of ivory that is
causing much cruel suffering among these highly social animals
and decimating their populations.

WILL OUR COUNTRY ACCEPT ITS
DOLPHIN PROTECTION
RESPONSIBILITIES?

“The hunting of Dolphins is immoral and that man can no
more draw nigh the gods as a welcome sacrificer nor touch their
altars with clean hands but pollutes those who share the same
roof with him, whoso willingly devises destruction for Dolphins.
For equally with human slaughter, the gods abhor the deathly
doom of the monarchs of the deep . . . ” Oppian

If we accept the wisdom of the Ancients as expressed by Op-
pian, immorality is rife in the United States and Japan.

The government of Nagasaki even provided a “Dolphin
Processor” to Iki Island to chop up the dolphins deliberately
captured and slaughtered on their migratory path in late Febru-
ary and early March.

The US. government has scheduled hearings before an ad-
ministrative law judge to examine the findings of the scientific
workshop which determined that offshore spotted dolphins, the
species most often set upon by tuna purse seine fishermen, are
depleted. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, depleted
species may not be taken. The tuna industry is preparing to
argue the case strongly.

The only way a final solution can be reached is to use a dif-
ferent method for locating and setting the seines on schools of
tuna- The best hope lies with fish aggregating devices. These
have been successfully used in Hawaiian waters and are now
the subject of a proposal for a statewide fish aggregation
system, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service.
They have already brought about a substantial reduction in
scouting time and pursuit of tuna schools because the fish tend
to stay round the anchored rafts from which forty foot pieces of
net hang free in the water. It is a remarkable fact that fish and
other marine organisms are attracted to such foreign objects. It
has been reported that even an old rain coat ﬂoating on the sur-
face has attracted fish; oil drums have been set out successfully
to aggregate them and floating trunks of dead palm trees are
well known to fishermen who have used them for “log fishing”
for many years.

A proposal to research both aggregating devices and
methods of locating schools of tuna fish not associated with
dolphins, has been prepared by Frank Awbrey and William
Evans, scientists from the University of San Diego and Hubbs-
Sea World respectively. This carefully prepared work should be
implemented immediately by industry and government to elim-
inate the pursuit of dolphin herds and setting of the giant purse
seines around them.

The purse seine fishery is now known to all the dolphin herds
in the Eastern tropical Pacific, and as soon as they perceive a
seiner, the whole dolphin school starts to “run”, swimming and
leaping at top speed. The speedboats deployed by the big $5-
million purse seiners must now be equipped with extra fuel
tanks for their ruthless pursuit of the dolphins. The chases
which used to last one to two hours now are extended to three
or four hours before the exhausted dolphins are able to “run”
no more, and they are encircled in the seines. Such prolonged
chases cannot be sustained by the old, the weak, or diseased,
the very young or the pregnant dolphins. Death from exhaus-
tion is likely to follow such persistent pursuit, thus, causing more
damage to populations that are either depleted or likely to
become so.

The cruelty of the chase has enormously intensified as the
dolphins have learned that they must do their very best to avoid
tuna seiners. At the same time, the cost of the chase in fuel and
time spent continues to rise. Thus, selfish and altruistic motives
combine to demand the discovery of a tuna fishing method
which does not depend on dolphins.

Compliance with federal law, the Marine Mammal Protection
Act, likewise calls for a goal approaching zero mortality and
serious injury rate.

The Act’s definition of “taking” includes harassment of mar-
ing mammals. The harassment meted out by the multimillion

TI-IE KELLERT REPORT

The extent to which the general public is willing to put wild
animals ahead of purely economic considerations has susprised
many cynics when they read phase I of a Yale School of For-
estry and Environmental Studies survey: “Public Attitudes
Toward Critical Wildlife and Natural Habitat Issues.” The study,
funded by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, was con-
ducted in a highly professional and extremely thorough manner
showing close correlation with the US. census with regard to
age, sex, race, and occupation.

The 138-page study covers a broad area. Some of the ques-
tions of particular interest to readers of the Information Report
include views on endangered species, predator control, use of
the steel jaw leghold trap, and poisons.

When asked which of a list of endangered Species they would
be willing to protect even if it resulted in higher costs for an
energy development project, 89% favored protection for the
bald eagle, 73% for the mountain lion, 71% for the Agassiz
trout, 70% for the American crocodile and 64% for the Silver-
spot butterfly.

When asked whether they would approve poisoning of coy-
otes because it is the least expensive solution even though
other animals besides coyotes may be killed, 92% of the
general public disapproved. However, when sheep producers
were asked the same question 75% approved.

The general public and the sheepmen were also diametrically
opposed though not to quite such an extreme degree, on the
question as to whether cattle and sheep grazing should be lim-
ited on publicly owned lands if it destroys plants needed by
wildlife even though this may result in higher meat costs. Sixty
percent of the general public agreed, and 59% of the sheep-
men disagreed.

The public expressed its willingness to pay higher prices for
tuna fish if this resulted in fishermen killing fewer porpoises in
their nets. Sixty-nine percent were prepared to make a financial
sacrifice to protect dolphins.

With regard to the steel jaw leghold trap the study shows
78% of the general public oppose use of the steel jaw leghold
trap to capture wild animals.

 




DOLPHINS Continued

dollar U.S. tuna fleet is far more severe than any other marine
mammal receives at the hands of American citizens, and it in-
volves tens of thousands of dolphins chased, set upon, and
released when the tuna seiner backs down to let the dolphins
out of the nets before the tuna are hauled on board.

The tuna industry, after four separate lawsuits were won by
environmental and humane groups, reduced the numbers of
dolphins killed and injured before release from the seines, but
they have not reduced the number chased and held in the nets
prior to release.

The issue now is the chase, the suffering and death it inflicts,
and the need to end dependency on the dolphin herds to locate
yellow fin tuna.

If the Awbrey-Evans proposal is promptly funded and im—
plemented, and if it leads to development of efficient fishing
methods without harassment of dolphins, it will solve the US.
tuna fleet’s problems and carry over to seiners of other nations.
This is important, for though the seiners are still preponderantly
American, they have become popular with other countries too.

Venezuela, the Congo, New Zealand, Senegal, and Spain
have informed their vessel operators that they must fish in ac-
cordance with US. law and follow dolphin release procedures
required of US. operators (San Diego Law Review, April,
1979). Senegal volunteered to be bound by US. quotas and to
cease setting on any species for which the quotas have been
reached. _

Under the heading of “The Responsibility of the United
States in International Programs,” (Ibid.), Laurel Lee Hyde
writes, “In addition to the moratorium on imported yellowfin
under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the United
States could ban the importation of all tunafish products from
any State whose nationals fish in a manner that diminishes the
effectiveness of an international fishery conservation program
under the Pelly amendment. The amendment’s broad defini-
tion of international fishery agreements includes international
programs for cetacean conservation. Thus, the United States
may ban not only all yellowfin imports but all other fish product
imports as well from any State that frustrates the purpose of an
international program to protect the dolphin and to reduce their
incidental kill in tuna industry. The invocation of these trade
sanctions does not demand that a species or stock be in danger
of extinction or that a treaty be violated. The offending party
need not even be a party to the conservation program it is
hindering. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion (NOAA) has used the Pelly amendment to encourage
non-International Whaling Commission (IWC) States to join the
IWC or at least to comply with IWC regulations. It could active-
ly be used in connection with the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission’s (IATTC) attempts to internationalize dolphin
protection if the United States decides to accept fully the
responsibilities imposed by the MMPA.”

SAVING SEA TURTLES

A world Conference on Sea Turtle Conservation was held in
the US. Department of State November 26—30 and attracted
turtle scientists, representatives of turtle products industries,
government officials, and environmentalists. At the conclusion
of the 4-day meeting, a turtle conservation policy was unani—
mously adopted; and the International Union for the Conserva-
tion of Nature was put in charge of implementing it.

The conservation strategy was prepared by Dr. David Ehren-
feld, a turtle scientist of broad interests who holds an MD.

Degree from Harvard University and wrote The Arrogance of
Humanism (Oxford University Press, 1978). Emphasizing that
the goal is the ending of international trade in all sea turtle
products, the strategy singles out four of the most immediate
priorities: (1) the leather trade, a new industry which constitutes
an intolerable drain on the sea turtle populations, especially L.
oliuacea (Olive Ridley); (2) trade in stuffed baby sea turtles; (3)
eggs collected for sale in distant markets; and (4) trade in tor-
toiseshell.

The incidental catch of sea turtles is described as a major
threat to many sea turtle populations. “All countries,” the strat-
egy states, “should be prepared to establish restricted fishing
zones in areas of high turtle concentration . . .The development
of trawls that exclude sea turtles should be given high priority.”

Other matters covered in the conservation strategy include
Habitat Destruction and Pollution, Conservation Education,
Regulations, Laws and Treaties, and Enforcement.

SCIENCE FAIR MONITORING
KIT OFFERED

Inhumane biology projects involving animals conducted by
young students for science fairs have been a constant problem
for many years. For instance, a recent prize-winning high school
student project at the International Science and Engineering
Fair involved cutting off the legs and tails of a lizard to demon-
strate the well-known fact that tails regrow and legs don’t.

If you would like to actively participate in a campaign to
reduce the incidence of such improper student projects, the
Scientists Center for Animal Welfare has a “Science Fair Moni-
toring Kit” which explains what you can do. For copies of the

CEQ DOCUMENTS ORV’s DEADLY HAVOC

Motorcycles, dune buggies, snowmobiles and other off-road
vehicles (ORV’s) are causing irreversible damage to DUblic
lands and disrupting the activities of wildlife, domestic animals
and human hikers, campers, and skiers who use the land, M11:
lions of people roar through woods, fields, dunes and deserts
on ORV’s with little restriction, despite executive order 11989’5
unequivocal statement; “the respective agency head Shall
whenever he determines that the use of off-road vehicles will
cause or is causing considerable adverse effects on the soil
vegetation, wildlife, wildlife habitat or cultural or historic:
resources of particular areas or trails of the public lands, im-
mediately close such areas or trails to the type of off-road vehi-
cle causing such effects, until such time as he determines that
such adverse effects have been eliminated and that measures
have been implemented to prevent future recurrence.”

The Council on Environmental Quality has recently pub-
lished an 84—page report on the ORV problem, Off-Road Vehi-
cles on Public Land. Under Environmental Costs the report
states, “It is because ORV’s attack that relatively thin layer of
disintegrated rock and organic material to which all earthly life
clings—soil—that they can have such a devastating effect on
natural resources . . . and what happens when ORV’s strip away
the entire soil mantle, leaving exposed bedrock, as they have
done in numerous spots in California? Then recovery will take
millennia . . . They collide with animals, especially smaller mam-
mals and reptiles. By destroying vegetation, they are also
destroying animal food and shelter. In addition, ORV’s afford
hunters and fishermen access to remote, heretofore untouched
areas, thereby dramatically increasing the fish and game kills in
those areas.”

Under “The Impact of Snowmobiles” we find, “Jack Hope
reports: ‘At 80-acre Pierz Lake in Minnesota, where summer
canoeists were once rewarded for their six-hour paddle with a
catch of a two-pound trout, a troop of 120 snowmobiles virtual-
ly cleaned out the lake in a single winter’s day, packing out 556
pounds of fish.’ ”

As for birds, the report notes, “In Anderson Valley, an undis-
turbed area had twice the bird biomass and number of species
and 1.5 times the number of birds as a similar area of ‘mod-
erate’ ORV use.”

VIEWS OF A NOBEL LAUREATE
ON FACTORY FARMING

George Wald, Professor of Biology Emeritus, Harvard Uni-
versity, Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine, 1967, has
written AWI giving his permission to publish his opinion on the
extreme confinement and other deprivations suffered by live-
stock and poultry on factory farms.

Professor Wald states: “Never before in human history have
the animals that bring meat to the table been subjected to such
cruelties as in present factory procedures. Always heretofore
animals raised for meat have lived some degree of normal ani-
mal lives up to the dreadful day of slaughter. But a few years
ago the realization began to be exploited that an animal allowed
to move thereby grows and fattens more slowly. Hence, every-
thing now is done to see to it that animals move as little as
possible during their entire lives. Either they are fastened in
stanchions, or boxed in narrow stalls, or packed in pens or feed-
lots so that they can hardly move. Chickens are so crowded
throughout their lives as to be unable to move about. That irri-
tates them so that they try to peck one another; but that would
spoil their skins. So they are de-beaked; and if allowed to live
long enough, may be de—beaked again. In part, to reject such
brutalities my family has gone semi-vegetarian. We permit our-
selves fish and invertebrates—clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops:
animals that live free until taken. But we find it neither hard nor
unhealthful to do without meat altogether.”

PROGRESS TOWARD REPLACING THE
STEEL JAW LEGI'IOLD TRAP

Tests show that the leg snare trap, developed by the Ontario
Ministry of Natural Resources, is capable of bringing about a
major reduction in serious injuries to captured animals.

In a letter to New York Assemblywoman Florence Sullivan,
sponsor of a bill to restrict the steel jaw leghold trap, Mr. L. H.
Eckel, Executive Coordinator of Outdoor Recreation for the
province of Ontario wrote, “We extensively field tested this new
trap in 1978 and compared it to the leghold trap. The Capture
rates for the live-trap and leghold traps were identical at 71 per-
cent each. The live-trap captured fewer skunks as compared to
the leghold trap, 28 vs. 96 percent. Six percent of the captured
animals escaped from the live-trap and 7 percent from the leg-
holds. None of the animals captured in the live-trap were serl'
ously injured (cuts, chewed feet, broken bones, etc.) whereas 43
percent of the animals caught in the legholds were. Eighty-
seven percent of the animals captured in the live-trap were
caught above the pads as compared to 34 percent captured in
the leghold. The live-traps were set a total of 1457 trap-mghts
and the legholds a total of 746 trap-nights. A total of 190

 




animals discharged the live-traps and 74 animals discharged the
legholds.

The Ontario government is seeking a patent so the new trap
can be manufactured and marketed.

NATIONAL ADVISORY EYE
COUNCIL POLICY STATEMENT

Procedures to Assure Freedom from Pain in
Experiments upon Cold-Blooded Vertebrates
Adopted October 25, 1979

Issue

The new policy (“Responsibility for Care and Use of Ani-
mals”) on humane care and use of vertebrate animals under
NIH-supported grants, contracts, and other awards, appeared in
the November 10, 1978 issue of the NIH Guide for Grants and
Contracts. At recent meetings of the National Advisory Eye
Council, this policy was discussed in terms of providing ade-
quate guidance on humane care and use of cold-blooded lower
vertebrates, which are used extensively for vision research.

Background

It was agreed in these discussions that the new policy state-
ment on “Responsibility for Care and Use of Animals” provides
essential guidance to research scientists, institutional and peer
review groups, NIH program staff, and the NIH Office for the
Protection from Research Risks, on the humane care and use of
vertebrate animals under NIH awards. This guidance probably
suffices for most purposes, since there is a long history of atten-
tion by biological scientists to the conditions which assure that
experimental work is conducted under pain-free conditions,
especially in mammals. However, the new policy statement
provides no guidance on the special problems involved in the
humane care and use of cold-blooded lower vertebrates, which
appear in particular need of further consideration.

Since it has sometimes been assumed that cold-blooded ver-
tebrates do not experience pain, this question needs to be
addressed. Being an important adaptive survival mechanism,
pain is probably a primitive mechanism that appeared early in
evolution. Also, the continuity of vertebrate evolution makes it
extremely unlikely that pain first appeared in mammals. It is
likewise relevant that functional continuity among vertebrates is
commonly assumed in using cold-blooded vertebrates to obtain
results that may be applied to mammals, and especially to
humans. Since this assumption is demonstrably reasonable for
many of the research problems that prompt the use of cold-
blooded vertebrates, it would seem unreasonable to assume at
the same time that cold-blooded vertebrates do not feel pain.
This is a subject upon which proof is lacking, and definitive evi-
dence cannot be foreseen in the near future. But even a cursory
review reveals strong reasons for believing that cold-blooded
vertebrates do experience pain. Hence prudence requires that
these animals receive at least the same consideration as mam-
mals, if undue suffering is to be prevented.

In fact, if cold-blooded vertebrates experience pain, it is par-
ticularly important to strive for pain-free conditions during ex-
periments upon them. This is partly because cold-blooded ver-
tebrates are often used in research to avoid undesirable effects
of the anesthetics that are required in mammalian work. Also,
the nervous systems of cold-blooded vertebrates continue to
function for long periods after procedures that would quickly
kill mammalian nerve cells. This is another reason why cold-
blooded vertebrates are used so extensively in research. But
prolonged survival also means, for example, that if a frog or tur—
tle is decapitated, the decapitated head may be capable of ex-
periencing pain for several hours. In short, one of the main
reasons for using cold-blooded vertebrates can also place these
animals at particular risk of suffering. Since these animals pro-
vide us with much useful information, and have no choice in

this matter, there is a clear responsibility to prevent such suffer-
ing.

It is believed that these background considerations are
already familiar to, and accepted by, most persons who are con-
cerned with humane experimentation upon cold-blooded ver-
tebrates. But it is also believed important to clarify the policy of
the National Advisory Eye Council on these points.

Recommendation

Since a great deal of vision research is conducted upon cold-
blooded lower vertebrates, the National Advisory Eye Council
believes that, for research supported by the NEI, effective and
uniform procedures should be adopted to minimize pain in
these animals. In many cases this can be done very easily with
n0 Compromise to the advantages of working with cold-blood-
ed vertebrates. For much research in vision, the first step is
decapitation. Following decapitation, unless the experiment re-
Cluires an intact brain, the National Advisory Eye Council rec-
Ommends that the brain be destroyed immediately by pithing
through the spinal cord. This procedure is already done in
many laboratories, and should be done consistently, regardless

El viihether any further operative work is performed upon the
ea .

 

REGULATIONS FOR 1978 HUMANE
SLAUGHTER ACT INCLUDE
PRE-SLAUGHTER HANDLING

The 1978 amendments to the Federal Humane Slaughter
Act of 1958 are at last in force. Final regulations published in
the November 30, 1979 Federal Register were summarized in a
bulletin issued January 29, 1980 for the US. Department of
Agriculture’s regional directors and supervisors and distributed
to all involved.

The major changes in the law are 1) Coverage of all animals
in federally inspected plants 2) coverage from the time they
arrive at the plant with regard to handling and care 3) powerful
incentive to packers to treat animals humanely because of
potential large monetary losses when federal inspection is sus-
pended (no slaughter allowed) because of inhumane practices
and 4) requirement that imported meat be from humanely
slaughtered animals.

A few quotations from the USDA. bulletin follow:

“The Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1978 makes
humane slaughtering and handling mandatory for all cattle,
sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, and other equines slaugh-
tered under inspection at federally inspected plants . . . The
humane stunning and slaughtering provisions contained in Part
390 are now mandatory for all livestock, except those being
slaughtered ritually, under the Humane Methods of Slaughter
Act of 1978 . . . Handling Requirements. The animals shall be
handled humanely in the livestock pens and while being driven
to and from the pens. Driving of livestock shall be accomplished
with a minimum of excitement and discomfort to the animals.
With respect to permitted driving implements, determination of
the humaneness of a driving implement lies as much in the way
it is used as in the implement itself. However, metal pipes and
sharp pointed objects shall not be permitted. Electric prods, can-
vas slappers, or other implements used to drive animals shall be
employed as little as possible to minimize excitement and injury
to the livestock being driven. All livestock shall have access to
water. Feed shall be supplied if livestock are to be held more
than 24 hours before being slaughtered. There shall be suffi-
cient room in the pens for animals held overnight to lie down.
Electronic prods which are connected to AC house current shall
be reduced by a transformer to the lowest effective voltage not
to exceed 50 volts AC. There is some evidence that voltages as
low as 20 volts AC are effective.

“Downer animals shall not be dragged. In some instances,
immediate slaughter may be the most humane thing to do, in
which case the animal shall be given ante-mortem inspection
and then stunned before moving it.

“Pens, driveways, and ramps shall be kept in good repair to
prevent injury to the livestock. Sharp objects, loose, splintered,
or broken boards and other pain producing objects shall be
eliminated or repaired. Pen floors and alleyways shall be slip
resistant. Sand may be used to provide livestock with a more
secure footing, especially during winter months . . .

“Whenever a violation of the Humane Methods of Slaughter
Act occurs and operations are stopped, the inspector in charge
shall notify plant management of the reasons for taking action.
If the situation is corrected and the problem resolved at the es-
tablishment level, operations may resume. Report the incident
to the Area Supervisor. If the matter cannot be resolved at the
establishment level, refer plant management to the next level of
supervision.”

Commenting in The Federal Register on complaints from in-
dustry about the loss of funds which a plant could suffer when
operations are suspended under the law, U.S.D.A.’s Adminis-
trator of Food, Safety, and Quality Service stated: “The prin-
cipal purpose of the Act is to deter and prevent inhumane treat-
ment, not to punish for violations. Furthermore, the temporary
suspension of inspection for inhumane handling or slaughter
would be done in the same manner as the temporary suspen-
sion of inspection because of sanitation deficiencies. The use of
the ‘US Rejected’ tag would similarly have the same function
and meaning as when used on insanitary equipment. It may be
removed by the inspector in charge when the cause is corrected
or satisfactory assurances are given.”

ICLA RECOMMENDS AVOIDANCE OE
DUPLICATION OF TOXICITY TESTS FROM
ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER

At the January 1979 meeting of the Governing Board of the
International Committee on Laboratory Animals a resolution
was passed expressing support for animal experimentation
while drawing attention to means whereby significant reduc-
tions in the numbers of animals used have been or could be
achieved.

According to the Canadian Association for Laboratory Ani-
mal Science Newsletter (vol. 11, No. 5, Oct., 1979), “Lab-
oratory animal technology, which has done much to advance
the health of experimental animals particularly when allied to
statistical analysis, also has led to significant reductions in the
number of animals used.

“A further considerable reduction in the numbers of animals
used would follow if national regulatory authorities could be
persuaded to revise the number of animals used in toxicity test-
ing and avoid duplications from one country to another.”

 

 




TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH IN
PREVENTING WILDLIFE DEATHS BY
AUTOMOBILES

The Austrian Academy of Science has confirmed the highly
successful results of an investigation by the Institute of Com-
parative Behavior on reduction of road accidents involving
animals. Animal behavior theory was put into practice by a
company that manufactures optical devices. Reflectors were
devised for placement 10 or 20 yards apart, giving the appear-
ance of reflected, red eyes glowing in the dark. Thus, animals’
natural inborn fear of predators is translated, in behavioral
terms, to the fear they need to feel of an oncoming motor vehi—
cle if collisions are to be avoided. Automobiles have been dead-
ly to wildlife because there has been no way to inform animals
of the dangerous speed and power of a phenomenon which
has had no place in the evolution of any species. The eyes of
predators, on the other hand, are instantly recognized as signal-
ling danger. It is a universal language.

Because the car headlights strike a number of the reflectors,
many “eyes” flare up instantly, thus producing an “optical
fence”. The result has been a decrease of 80% of collisions with
animals after dark in Austrian roads equipped with these reflec-
tors.

“Swareflex” wildlife reflectors are available in the United
States from the Strieter Corporation, 2100 Eighteenth Avenue,
Rock Island, Ill. 61201. The Company describes the effect of
the reflectors thus: “The headlights of approaching vehicles
strike the wildlife reflectors which are installed on both sides of
the road. Unnoticeable to the driver, these reflect red lights into
the adjoining terrain and an optical warning fence is produced.
Any approaching wildlife is alerted and stops or returns to the
safety of the countryside. Immediately after the vehicle has

passed, the reflectors become inactive, thereby permitting the
animals to cross safely.”

It is noted that thousands of miles of European roads where
deer frequently cross have been made safe with these reflec-
tors. In Austria alone, 300,000 reflectors have been installed.
Furthermore, unlike fixed fences which interrupt the accus-
tomed paths of wildlife, the optical warning fence is activated
only when a vehicle approaches.

Although the driver does not see the reflection, animals of all
kinds and sizes approaching the road do. Due to the large angle
of dispersion of these wildlife reflectors, spacing up to 66 feet on
straight parts of highways is effective.

Otto Koenig, in an essay on the importance of eyes and eye
symbols, notes that red is the most important “alarm color” for
men and other vertebrates. Humans react mOSt definitely to
round red stop lights. Primitive man frequently used eye repre-
sentatives and symbols on his dwellings. A number of animals
from moths to hawks have representations of eyes to aid them
in survival, the moths on their wings, the hawks on the backs of
their heads.

At a conference of the Austrian Automobile Association in
1965 on prevention of accidents to wildlife, Dr. Koenig sug-
gested mounting red warning reflectors in eye patterns on both
sides of the road. Sources of light arranged by pairs would sug-
gest the eyes of predators, he said. Dr. Koenig was asked by the
Swarovski Company whether wildlife could really see the color
red, since hunters had insisted that animals were color blind. He
provided substantial documentation and common observation
to the contrary.*

The results of tests attracted the attention of Austrian hunting
federations and traffic engineers, and in recorded checks of 30
kilometers of particularly dangerous areas for animal crossings
233 animals were killed each year before the wildlife reflectors
were installed, and afterwards this number decreased to 55
animals per annum (roughly a decrease of 80%). On some of
the test sections there were no more accidents with animals at
all after the reflectors were installed.

It is estimated that installation of the reflectors pays off within
approximately six months through reduction of wildlife acci-
dents in areas where these are prevalent. They are much
cheaper than fences.

The Animal Welfare Institute is requesting the United States
Department of Transportation to encourage use of reflectors to

The World Conservation Strategy, its fourth and final draft in
nent, was launched simultaneously by the International Union
the hands of governments and private groups on every conti-
for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources on
March fifth with ceremonies in Australia, Barbados, Belgium,
Brazil, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, Dominican
Republic, England, Finland, France, Germany, Grenada, Hong
Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, The
Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Thailand, Venezuela, United States, and Zambia.

In Washington, the Secretary General of the Organization of
American States Alejandro Orfila was host to the hundreds
who came to hear Russell Train, President of the World Wildlife
Fund/United States, Cecil Andrus, Secretary of the Interior,
former President Oduber of Costa Rica and other distinguished
conservationists speak.

Senator John Chafee (R., RI) announced introduction of his
bill to assist wildlife on an international basis. He said, in part:
“No one nation is the sole arbiter of its natural resources. One
country’s loss of habitat might trigger a decline in a migratory
species of unique inportance far beyond the boundaries of that
land. To turn that around, one nation’s gain in conservation is
everyone’s gain.

“In the spirit of today’s celebration, I wish to announce an ef-
fort on which we in the United States Congress are embarking.

“Nowhere among the world’s declining natural resources is
there a more extreme case than in the area of wildlife and the
habitat upon which it must depend. We may attempt to deal
with such problems as a species decline or disappearance
through trade laws and such, but the quagmire is much deeper
and so must be our approach.

“I was dismayed at the tragedy of our wildlife resources high-
lighted during recent hearings of our Senate Environment
Committee. We see species gradually disappearing from the
earth. Loss of habitat vital to wildlife, such as tropical rain
forests, is a dangerous threat to many forms of wildlife around
the globe. Two scourges of the world environment, deforesta-
tion and desertification, are taking a high toll on this precious
resource.

“I will leave here today to go back to the Senate to introduce
bipartisan legislation which would enable the United States to
extend international assistance in wildlife resource conservation
and management. The bill represents the kind of initiatives we
are fueling here with the launch of the World Conservation
Strategy. It is positive in its approach. Among its features is an
international conservation corps whereby experts from our
country can assist other nations in developing their capability to
manage their living natural resources. We would also make
available training opportunities in wildlife conservation for
representatives from other countries, so that they could attend
higher education or research institutions or take part in other
conservation training courses here in the United States.
Resource attaches would be stationed in up to ten key regions
around the world as liaisons for the gathering of needed conser-
vation information.

“I challenge the countries and organizations represented here
today, and indeed all those involved in the World Conservation
Strategy, to match our offer. Make a commitment to turn the
tide on the deterioration of our wildlife and its habitat. It doesn’t
take a lot of money. I have a hard time thinking of an effort
where the benefits would be greater for the modest amounts
spent. Join with us in a truly international conservation corps.
Who says the United States has a corner on the market of wild-
life conservation corps. We are talking about creativity here . . .
and no nation or organization will admit to being short on crea-
tivity! '

“Let us all sow together the seeds for assuring that man does
not become a species who contemplates himself . . .by himself."

Senator Chafee’s bill includes several of the basic provisions
of the House-passed elephant protection bill, urgently needed
to prevent the current poaching and smuggling of ivory that is
causing much cruel suffering among these highly social animals
and decimating their populations.

THE LATEST ON FUR

The new edition of Facts About Furs is now available from
the Animal Welfare Institute. Based on four years of research
by AWI staff, the book is a comprehensive account of the fur
trade and the animals involved in it. Illustrated with 79 photo-
graphs, many beautiful studies of animals in the wild, others giv-
ing sorry documentation of frenzied battles with the steel trap,
the 258-page book contains 47 chartsytables and maps, 18
appendices, and an index.

Principal author of the new edition is Greta Nilsson, who
wrote The Bird Business and did the research and writing for
authoritative reports on otters and macaws.

Hope Ryden, whose books God’s Dog, The Last of Amer-
ica’s Wild Horses, and The Little Deer of the Florida Keys, have
won her a secure place in the annals of American nature writing
and photography, contributed many photos, as did Dick
Randall, whose powerful documentation of the suffering
caused by steel traps is equalled by no other photographer in
the world. Other illustrations range from Audubon prints to cur-
rent news photos. AWI is grateful to the World Wildlife Fund
and Defenders of Wildlife for supplying numerous photos.

The first two editions of Facts About Furs were written by F.
Jean Vinter, MD. of the Universities Federation for Animal
Welfare, who set the high standard of obtaining precise data on
the numbers of animals taken country-by-country, detailed
description of the different traps used, available scientific studies
and legislation regulating trapping. Developments since Dr.
Vinter’s pioneering study are summarized in the foreword to
the third edition as follows:

“In 1958, one year after the first edition of Facts About Furs
was published by the Universities Federation for Animal
Welfare, England and Wales outlawed what the British call the
‘gin trap,’ known to Americans as the steel jaw leghold trap.”

“By the time the second edition was published by the Animal
Welfare Institute in 1973, Denmark, Austria, Chile, Republic of
Ireland, the Federal Republic of Germany, Norway, Switzer-
land, India, Gambia, and the remainder of Great Britain—
Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the Channel Islands, Jersey
and Guernesy, had outlawed the trap.”

“Since then, Bangladesh, Belize, Brazil, Burundi, British West
Indies, Colombia, Costa Rica, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon,
Ghana, Hong Kong, Hungary, Israel, Ivory Coast, Jamaica,
Jordan, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Malawi, Malaysia, Mauritania,
Morocco, Mozambique, Niger, Portugal, Rhodesia, Senegal,
Seychelles, Singapore, Sweden, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo,
Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Uganda, and Upper Volta have
banned it, bringing the total to 48 countries.”

IWC ADDRESSES PROFOUND SCIENTIFIC
AND ETHICAL QUESTIONS

An unprecedented meeting sponsored by the International
Whaling Commission took place April 28-May 1 at the Smith-
sonian Institution. The report submitted by the Chairman of the
Conference, Professor Derek Ovington, Australia’s Commis-
sioner to the IWC and Director of the Australian National Parks
and Wildlife Service, follows, together with a few quotations
from the papers submitted by scientists, philosophers, and other
participants:

Report on Meeting on Cetacean Behavior
and Intelligence, and Ethics of Killing
Cetaceans

By J. D. Ovington

Background

At the 30th Annual Meeting of the International Whaling
Commission (IWC) in July 1979, the Commission agreed to a
specialist meeting to consider (1) Cetacean Behavior and Intelli-
gence as relevant to Cetacean Assessment and Management
and (2) the Ethics of Killing Cetaceans. A steering committee was
appointed to organize the meeting.

Financial support was provided by the International Whaling
Commission, the Institute for Delphinid Research, the Animal
Welfare Institute and the Governments of Australia and the
U.S.A.

The aims of the meeting, as given by the Secretary of the IWC,
were to provide

(a) a source of specific advice and information for the IWC for
use in its analysis, estimating procedures and establishment of
catch limits whilst whaling continues: and

(b) a unique forum for discussions of more general questions
of the ethics of whaling and their implications for the IWC. The
meeting was held in the Smithsonian Institution, Washington
D.C. USA from 28 April to 1 May 1980.

Organization

Professor J. D. Ovington, the Australian Commissioner to the
IWC, was appointed Chairman of the meeting as a whole and
chaired the opening and concluding sessions. The early sessions
concerned with intelligence and behavior were chaired by Dr.
Sydney J. Holt and the later sessions on ethics were chaired by
Dr. Lyall Watson. Both chairmen were assisted by three rapport-
eurs in preparing the minutes of the sessions for which they were
responsible.

Typed copies of submitted papers were available for partici-
pants, authors were given an opportunity to speak to their
papers prior to a general discussion and the lectures and discus-
sions were taped. In addition, several films were screened at
appropriate times.

The meeting was well attended with consistently over 100
people present. Unfortunately, since few members of the IWC
Scientific Committee attended, the opportunity was lost for con-
structive interactions with the scientists involved in stock assess-
ments and the formulation of IWC catch limits.

The Meeting

Richard Frank, the USA Commissioner to the IWC, in wel-
coming the participants emphasized the importance he attached
to the subjects to be discussed.

In his opening remarks, Professor J. D. Ovington pointed out
the meeting was an important development in the approach of
the IWC to cetacean management. Such management requires a
sensitive understanding of marine organisms and their environ-
ments. He explained that the IWC was seeking guidance and
information and gave a number of practical examples where
advice was needed.

Comments on the papers and dicussions are available through
the reports of the meeting prepared by the chairman and rap-
porteurs and the summaries of the two chairmen.

The discussions embraced the following topics: the difficulties
of defining intelligence and the relevance of a neurobiological
definition of intelligence; brain anatomy and evolution; tech-
niques of testing intelligence in cetaceans; research needs and
constraints with emphasis on benign research; the assessment of
the risks of whaling to cetaceans, people and the planet; cultural
differences between nations to the utilization of cetaceans and
the validity in these circumstances of a global ethic; communica-

IWC MEETING (Continued)

tion problems between cetaceans and humans and the inappro-
priateness of some tests used to assess cetacean intelligence;
social interactions and adaptive behaviour of cetaceans, for
example, in areas where cetaceans have become a tourist attrac-
tion; the impact of whaling on the social behaviour of cetaceans,
especially those with latitudinal differences in distribution of dif-
ferent components of a population; the nature and cause of
cetacean strandings and administrative arrangements for dealing
with stranded whales; behaviour of whales during whaling opera-
tions; the killing of dolphins on Iki Island and the need to resolve
conflicts with fisheries interests; animal rights; and the question of
the humaneness of whaling methods.

The meeting was characterized by a frank, and at times
heated, exchange of viewpoints. Participants at the meeting
included scientists who are studying cetaceans as scientific sub-
jects, representatives of the whaling industry who see cetaceans
as a natural resource to be harvested, representatives of the fish-
ing industry concerned about the effects of cetaceans on fish
stocks, conservationists troubled about the past and determined
to safeguard the future of cetaceans, philosophers concerned
with the attitude of people to highly evolved animals and
bureaucrats who have to be responsive to public and political
pressures. Only time will show if the exchange of views that
occurred will lead to the development of better relationships
between cetaceans and people.

In general it was not possible in the time available to discuss
the issues raised in detail. Much of the material presented was
based on already published information, but some significant
new material was also presented. Nevertheless there is a scarcity
of factual information and the data available are subject to differ-
ent interpretations. For example, the early evolution, large size
and complexity of the cetacean brain, the ability of dolphins to
participate in complex activities devised by humans and evi-
dence of co-operative behaviour between dolphins were gener-
ally accepted but participants differed in their interpretation of
the relevance of these observations as measures of intelligence.
A small number of papers prepared for the meeting could not be
discussed in the time available.

Whilst it was evident that there were widely differing views on
the need and justification for whaling there did appear to be
some measure of agreement on the following matters:

(a) no species of cetaceans should be made extinct and
human activities likely to endanger individual whale populations
should be avoided,

(b) human activities should not diminish the potential of ceta-
ceans to provide food, pleasure or economic gain for future
generations,

(c) cetaceans, as a common heritage, are a matter of interna-
tional concern,

(d) there is a unique opportunity to investigate communica-
tion between cetaceans and humans and every care must be
taken to ensure that this is not jeopardised,

(e) the inflicting of unnecessary suffering and pain on ceta-
ceans by human activities is unjustifiable.

Future

A meeting of the Steering Committee was held at the conclu-
sion of the meeting. The Steering Committee agreed to a pro-
posal that a collection of relevant papers should be published
through a commercial publishing company, with Ms. P. Wray
(Center for Action on Endangered Species) as editor.

The Steering Committee recognised that significant progress
had been made in clarifying issues and recommended that

(a) a workshop be established by the Scientific Committee of
IWC for further detailed examination of those matters identified
as being of greatest significance to the assessment and manage-
ment of cetaceans, and

(b) a workshop be established by the Technical Committee of
IWC to further develop the dialogue begun at the meeting
between philosophers and people concerned with the IWC with
respect to the ethics of whaling.

Excerpts from a Few of the Conference Papers

0 “Owing to the massive amounts in whales of what appears
to correspond to association cortex in land mammals; there is
strong justification for considering the brain of cetaceans capa-
ble of carrying out many of the same highly complex mental
functions as in the human brainz’TNith the tremendous potential
for higher brain activities residing in the almost completely neo-
corticalized brains of cetaceans, it is one of life’s ironies that na-
tions engaged in whaling practices are, unwittingly, destroying a
group of mammals which in terms of their own form of intelli-
gence, may be even closer cerebral relatives of man than the
subhuman primates. Certainly the facts demand reconsidera—
tion of past practices and a more enlightened future handling of
the problem.”—Dr. Myron S. Jacobs. Department of Pathology
and Oral Pathology, New York University Dental Center, and
Research Associate, Osborn Laboratories of Marine Sciences,
New York Aquarium.

0 “ . . . I think it should be admitted that the provision of sci-
entific advice through the existing [IWC] mechanism is a deeply
corrupting process. It is that process which perpetuates the
myth that scientiﬁc knowledge is adequate to the task assigned
of applying the NMP, and which specifically condones the con-
tinuation of present whaling operations. In fact, the only situa-
tions in which it is adequate are those where stocks of whales
have evidently been reduced so far below their ‘optimal’ levels
that there can be no doubt at all that they should be protected.

“ . . . Whatever else they may be cetaceans are large brained,
sociable, communicating and sensitive mammals with a broad
range of emotions, and great differences between individuals of
a species and even in their small groups, with long memories
and strong tendencies to parental care and other forms of
mutual aid. This means, I believe, that the present species are
likely over a far longer period than human history, to have
developed a mental culture which we are almost certainly
destroying just as surely colonizers of the new world destroyed
local human cultures, even if they did not make the indigenous
populations extinct.”—Dr. Sidney Holt, University of California,
Santa Cruz.

0 “If man is the goal of evolution then we can also accept what
follows from that assertion which is that the justification of
another animal’s existence is its usefulness to man. This was not
an unreasonable position given the known world that gave birth
to this view of reality. However, the discovery of intelligent
man-like creatures provided an anomaly that has proved indi-
gestible to this view of man’s place in nature. I think we are see-
ing in the debate surrounding the question of intelligence and
language in both apes and dolphins, the scientific world adjust
to this new reality. This process is occurring of a piece with a
reassessment of- whether man and his fellow creatures have
long term common interests that outweigh the short term bene-
fits of exploitation.”—Eugene Linden. Author of Apes, Men,
and Language.

0 “The most advanced in the animal world development of the
brain associative regions in some Cetacean, extremely complex
structure of populations, clearly pronounced (but not complete-
ly estimated due to imperfection of our own brain) highly com-
plicated behaviour—all this makes us to believe that intelligence
of Cetacean is the phenomenon which has no analogs in the
animal world.”—A. V. Yablokov, Institute of Developmental
Biology, U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, USSR.

0 “Now that hard science has revealed such special brains in
whales, we urge all men and nations to go about the task of
learning more about them and what they may tell us about our-
selves and our own evolution. Destroying another entire
species is the most unethical, despicable outrage man can per-
petrate against his own planet. The holocaust perpetrated
against whales needs to be warred against with all the tools,
economic and otherwise, we can muster. In destroying other
species man is slowly destroying himself. In destroying our
neurological relatives we are perpetrating genocide and will
lose the knowledge of another entire world. What a price to pay
for limited, local, nationalistic profit and outright greed!”—Peter
J. Morgane, Ph.D., Worcester Foundation for Experimental
Biology, Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.

THE LATEST ON FURS (Continued)

Running on parallel tracks are greatly increased fur prices,
the concomitant increase in trapping wild furbearers, and the
surge of public feeling against the cruelty of the steel trap. At the
same time, science is giving us intensive studies of intelligence
and behavior of a number of mammalian species, the results of
which bring the conflict into sharp focus.

To give a sampling of information from the new edition:

0 Far more wild than ranched animals are killed for fur in the
United States. Over 18,000,000 wild animals were trapped
in 1977—78, while only 3 million mink and fox were ranched.

0 Endangered species are still being killed in substantial num-
bers for the international fur trade. Ocelot skins are still being
exported from South America—estimated at over 30,000 in
1977—to furriers in Europe and Asia. Black market tiger
skins now sell for $3,000; a tiger coat represents .2 % of all
tigers left in the world.

0 In Texas, between 1970 and 1978, the price of raccoon pelts
rose from $3.50 to $26.00, the number of trappers rose from
5,000 to 32,900, and the number of raccoons trapped rose
from 150,000 to nearly 500,000 a year.

0 The history of the fur trade reveals the depletion of many
species of furbearing animals, reduced to endangered status
or even driven to extinction by the demands of the industry.
This trend, pushing some species to near extinction when
their pelts become fashionable, has continued to the present,
in spite of conservation legislation and international wildlife
treaties.

' A recent attitude survey conducted by the Yale School of
Forestry and Environmental Studies reveals that three quar-
ters of the American public favor a ban on the steel jaw
leghold trap.

' Siberian Lynx coats sell for as much as $150,000, while bob-
cat and North American Lynx coats sell for over $10,000 per
coat. Pelt prices have increased astronomically within the
past few years, causing trappers to seek out furbearers with
such thoroughness that many species are disappearing from
large areas.

The book is a guide upon which to base more humane and
enlighted treatment of furbearing animals and is available from
the Animal Welfare Institute for $3.00. Libraries and humane
societies may request one copy free.




 

 

The Animal Welfare Institute displayed literature promoting a humane approach to the study of biology at student
science fairs and in the classroom at a recent National Science Teachers Convention in Anaheim, California.
AWI Executive Assistant Fran Lipscomb conducted the booth.

WORKSHOP FOR HUMAN/ANIMAL
ECOLOGY PROGRAM

A workshop sponsored by the School of Forestry and Envi-
ronmental Studies of Yale University and the Geraldine Rocke-
feller Dodge Foundation was held February seventh. Its stated
purpose was to determine the potential role of animal rights
and welfare issues in the development of a Human/Animal
Ecology Program which would provide a scientific university
context for the study and resolution of various problems involv-
ing people and animals, particularly wildlife.

Dean of the School, Dr. Charles H. W. Foster, introduced the
workshop which was held in the Yale Club in New York City.
Dr. Stephen Kellert, who recently completed the survey, “Public
Attitudes toward Critical Wildlife and Natural Habitat Issues”
funded by the US. Fish and Wildlife Service, outlined the pur-
pose of the workshop. The fifteen participants included several
authors, scientists, television educators, a philosopher, a lawyer,
an engineer, and professors and representatives of animal
welfare and conservation organizations. They were asked to
address 1) substantive issues, 2) research needs, 3) educational
and training needs, and 4) policy and management issues.

Roland Clement pointed out that modern agriculture and
multinational corporations are chewing up what remains of our
resources and raised the question as to whether our short sight-
edness is is part of our biological make-up.

Craig Van Note called for a quantum leap in animal rights
with legal and ethical rights for animals as individuals and as a
group, emphasizing the right to survive. He referred to a new
type of inflation which is likely to get worse as the biological
clock records acceleration of extinctions. Citing lack of data, too
little and too late, his suggestion: “Send out a thousand
Darwin’s,” dramatized the necessity for greatly expanded action
by scientists.

James Mason pointed out that animal rights takes off from
the environmental ethic and recommended research from an
animal rights perspective. Animal exploitation, he said, should
be phased out. Citing Winthrop Jordan, he said the animal
hating idea is fundamental to racism.

Roger Caras blamed the elitist attitude of the human race
and the fact that animals are considered property for the failure
to establish an ethic.

Marlin Perkins struck a more cheerful note with the twenty to
twenty-five million dollars a year now being spent on non-game
wildlife in the State of Missouri as the result of a decision to use
part of the funds from sales tax for this purpose. He showed the
publications prepared for use in the public schools using this tax
money.

Tom Regan provided optimism, too, as he spoke of the enor-
mous activity in the past five to ten years with books, classes,
and symposia on animal rights, and distributed a bibliography of
recent publications on the subject. He expressed surprise that so
little had been said about fine art in this connection and listed
other areas: history of other peoples, systematic surveys, laws—
federal, state, city—and its social implications; wilderness, disci-
plined vision, logic, and moral philosophy.

Stephen Kellert asked, “How do we separate the ethical from
the scientific?” Michael Fox spoke of inner values and the over-
all imperative of the culture. All agreed that a basic biological
background was essential, but a number of scientists and non-
scientists stressed the danger of narrow science raised by Dr.
Clement. Andrew Rowan referred to the “myth of the unbiased
scientist,” and Hope Ryden told of the emotional outburst in a
scientific meeting on bobcats when a leading expert, Dr. Paul
Leyhausen, proposed a moratorium on the taking of bobcats.
Dr. Fox referred to the danger of tunnel vision in scientific pur-
suits.

All were agreed that a Human/Animal Ecology Program
addressing animal welfare and animal rights in a scientific uni-
versity context was desirable and appropriate.

NATIONAL SCIENCE TEACHERS
ASSOCIATION ADOPTS HUMANE CODE

A “Code of Practice on Animals in the Schools” was adopted
by the National Science Teachers Association Board of Direc-
tors at its 28th National Convention in Anaheim, California
March 21, 1980. The final language of the code will appear in a
fall issue of Science Teacher magazine.

Dr F. Barbara Orlans, a member of AWl’s scientific commit-
tee, and the Director of the Scientists’ Center for Animal Wel-
fare, chaired the NSTA committee which drafted the Code. Dr.
Orlans presented a workshop entitled “Plants, Worms, Insects,
Mammals—Classroom Maintenance, Projects and Code of
Practice” at the convention.

The AWI booth at the convention featured AWl’s Humane
Biology Projects, a comprehensive source of projects for
science fairs and the classroom.

BRITISH VETERINARY JOURNAL
REVIEWS AWI’S ANIMALS AND THEIR
LEGAL RIGHTS

A transatlantic view of AWI’s Animals and Their Legal Rights
is provided in the review of the book published by the British
Journal, Veterinary Practice, February, 1980. Veterinarians
may find the review of particular interest.

Since publication of the third edition, 2,720 public libraries,
2,910 chiefs of police and 560 humane societies have
requested free copies. The AWI policy of providing one free
copy to each of these groups, on request, continues. It is avail-
able at cost price, $2.00, to the general public.

Informative Law Book

“Those interested in animal welfare legislation are only too
aware of the numerous Acts, orders and by-laws involved and
the limited range of literature on the subject in Britain.

“Compare this, however, with the American scene in which
one author in ‘Animals and Their Legal Rights’ advises that,
‘For those who wish to do their part to alleviate animal suffer—
ing through law enforcement, the first step is to become familiar
with federal, state, county and municipal laws on the legal rights
of animals in their locality.’

“This book is a remarkable collection of American animal
welfare law, not comprehensive, but covering the main federal
and state laws. This in itself has clearly involved substantial col-
lation by a number of American authors and Ruth Harrison (on
‘Animals in factory farms’).

“Under the headings which include slaughter, laboratory
animal welfare, dogs, cats, horses, birds, marine mammals, pri-
mates and wildlife, the various authors have taken an individual
approach to their subject matter so that the chapters vary
between a chronological account of the achievement of a single
piece of legislation, a table of all state laws on a given subject
and the complete text of a law such as the Animal Welfare Act.

“The book is not intended as a comprehensive textbook,
however, and the amount of law together with the many
sources of further information is impressive. There is even
included some EEC legislation (on transport, stunning and farm
animals) and some English, German and French law relating to
experimental animals.

“The only disappointing part of the book is the bibliography
which, in attempting to include some English literature is sadly
out of date, while the American side is based largely on refer-
ences to legislature sub-committee hearings.

“Any minor disappointments are easily overruled by the
sheer quantity of information which would otherwise cost the
private individual substantial time and money to gather. The
book would be invaluable to a veterinary surgeon taking up

practice in the USA.”
—M. E. Cooper

 




 

ELEPHANTS IN UGANDA AND ZAMBIA
NEAR EXTINCTION; ANTI-POACHING
SQUADS HAVE LITTLE EFFECT

A scientific report just released warns that Uganda’s
elephants are on the verge of extinction and an October report
reveals that Zambia’s elephant population, too, is dwindling. In
areas where professional or volunteer wildlife guards are pres—
ent, losses are somewhat reduced, but poaching still takes a
heavytoﬂ.

A survey carried out by a team under the leadership of Dr.
lain Douglas-Hamilton of the International Union for Conserva-
tion of Nature’s (IUCN) African Elephant Group found that
poaching in Uganda, which became widespread during Idi
Amin’s regime, continues unabated.

Elephant numbers in their two former strongholds—the
Rwenzori and Kabalega Falls National Parks in western
Uganda—have plummeted from the 1972 levels. In Rwenzori
the population has fallen from 3,000 to just 150 individuals. In
the isolated southern section of the Kabalega Falls Park, the

decline has been even more catastrophic than in Rwenzori.
Here the IUCN team found that 160 elephants remained out of
a population numbering 9,000 seven years ago. In the north of
the park, where anti-poaching measures are still in force, the
position is less critical—1,200 elephants remain out of a 1973
population of 5,000.

In Zambia’s Luangwa National Park, a 10,000 square mile
wildlife reserve, an October aerial survey showed the elephant
population had declined from 90,000 in 1972 to a low of
50,000 animals.

A Zambian anti-poaching squad recently found a poacher’s
camp set up nine days previously. The take for those nine days
was 15 elephants, one rhino and a number of smaller animals.
The tusks and horn on world markets would have brought
about £40,000. The wildlife guards caught the hired marks-
man, five helpers and the ‘go-between,’ whose job was to orga-
nize the kill on behalf of the gang’s financial backer, allegedly a
government official.

The hunter was fined only £400, the equivalent of 950
American dollars, the go—between £450 and the camp workers
were jailed for four months each. Amazingly, all guns will be
returned to the poachers. The minor fines, easily met from the
gang’s purse, are the norm in Zambian courts. The law permits
five-year prison sentences and fines of £16,500, but such pun—
ishment is seldom exacted. Unfortunately, poaching is the best
form of living a man can make in Zambia. In two weeks he can
earn five years salary.

Understandably, the Zambian wildlife guards, living alone or
in pairs in isolated posts, poorly paid, and often without ammu-
nition, can offer little resistance to well-armed poaching gangs.
In fact, ten guards were killed by poachers between 1970 and
1977 and, according to one government representative, “a
sharp increase can be expected this year.”

Tragically, a number of guard posts in Zambia are now aban-
doned, and anti-poaching patrols in and around the park
almost non-existent. Volunteers help to man roadblocks around
the edge of the park and occasionally go into the bush in search
of the poachers, but their effectiveness is limited.

The IUCN team reports that if poaching is brought under
control, the elephant populations could recover. “But,” accord-
ing to Dr. Douglas-Hamilton, “if active and forceful anti-poach-
ing meaures are not introduced immediately, the Uganda
elephant faces extinction within a year or two.”

BRITAIN GIVES VEAL CALVES
ROOM TO MOVE

Instead of rearing veal calves in undersized crates on bare
slatted floors in total darkness, Britain’s largest veal firm has
developed a cheaper, more humane way of raising veal.

Quantock veal, which supplies about 90% of veal sold to
British households, now raises its veal calves in groups of 20-30
on beds of straw in well-lit airy buildings, with freedom to move
about.

According to Dr. Philip Paxman, managing director of Quan-
tock’s parent company, Volac, the new technique was devel-
oped becasue veal sales were down as a result of the cruelty
stigma. But, to the company’s pleasure, the system has proved
far cheaper than the traditional Dutch method.

“Loose housing works out to roughly £78 a calf compared
with £175 for the crated animal. The calves are more con-
tented and the meat is of excellent quality,” says Dr. Paxman.

USDA REPORT PREDICTING END OF OLD
FASHIONED PIG FARMING SPURS DEBATE

A report just released by the US. Department of Agriculture,
“Another Revolution in U. S. Farming?” predicts the demise of
the small farm hog producer. The report says that by the year
2000, three quarters of the hog industry will consist of factory
farms, each raising over 2,000 hogs per year. Already, there are
15 to 20 companies producing from 50,000 to 250,000 hogs
annually. _

According to the Center for Rural Affairs, the report further
claims that factory farms are a more efficient way of raising pigs,
implying that the nation would be better off with a hog industry
resembling today’s poultry industry.

Small farm pig producers reject the implication. They claim
that the authors of the report resorted to some questionable
economic logic to show small farms less efficient merely to
rationalize the continued proliferation of pig factory farms. The
flaw in the report’s logic, the farmers say, is that it includes the
purchase of a new barn as part of a small farm producer’s
expense.

While the report recognizes the importance of Federal tax
subsidies, pollution control regulations, availability of credit, and
Federal research programs in promoting the growth of factory
farming, the small farm producers say, the authors fail to realize
that the trend toward factory operations might be interrupted
by a reversal of these same Federal policies.

According to the farmers, USDA and agricultural college hog
production research could be reoriented to help the small
producers improve efficiency and profits; tax subsidies to hog
factories could be eliminated. The farmers feel justified in seek-
ing further support in light of the fact that the USDA report itself
states that hog factories have generally delivered no better litter
size or feed conversion rates than the traditional small-scale
producers and have actually resulted in higher death losses due
to the crowded, high stress confinement environment. (Empha-

ILLEGAL POLAR BEAR HIDE TRADE
SUPPORTS COCAINE IN ALASKA

Global trade in polar bear hides is the primary means of
financing the use of cocaine in Alaskan coastal villages, accord-
ing to the US. Fish and Wildlife Service’s chief law enforcement
agent and state drug investigators.

The Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits the sale of raw
polar bear hides to or between non-native Alaskans. But a large
polar bear hide measuring 10 feet square can be purchased for
about $1,000 in coastal villages and, after being smuggled out
of the country, it would sell for more than $10,000 in Japan.

Besides Japan, the other large trade center for Alaskan polar
bear hides is the London Fur Exchange, where the hides bring
premium prices alongside polar bear hides from Norway,
Greenland, Canada and Russia.

Estimates of the kill range from 200 to 400 a year, but the
exact figure is unknown. Fish and Wildlife agent Larry Hood
says his seven-man force is finding it nearly impossible to con-
trol or keep abreast of the trade. “We’re such small timers, we
just can’t compete,” says Hood of the sophisticated hide smug-
gling and drug selling connection.

“There’s absolutely no protection for the polar bear right
now,” according to Hood.

THE LATEST ON FUR

The new edition of Facts About Furs is now available from
the Animal Welfare Institute. Based on four years of research
by AWI staff, the book is a comprehensive account of the fur
trade and the animals involved in it. Illustrated with 79 photo-
graphs, many beautiful studies of animals in the wild, others giv-
ing sorry documentation of frenzied battles with the steel trap,
the 258~page book contains 47 charts, tables and maps, 18
appendices, and an index.

Principal author of the new edition is Greta Nilsson, who
wrote The Bird Business and did the research and writing for
authoritative reports on otters and macaws.

Hope Ryden, whose books God’s Dog, The Last of Amer-
ica’s Wild Horses, and The Little Deer of the Florida Keys, have
won her a secure place in the annals of American nature writing
and photography, contributed many photos, as did Dick
Randall, whose powerful documentation of the suffering
caused by steel traps is equalled by no other photographer in

the world. Other illustrations range from Audubon prints to cur-

rent news photos. AWI is grateful to the World Wildlife Fund
and Defenders of Wildlife for supplying numerous photos.

The first two editions of Facts About Furs were written by F.
Jean Vinter, MD. of the Universities Federation for Animal
Welfare, who set the high standard of obtaining precise data on
the numbers of animals taken country-by-country, detailed
description of the different traps used, available scientific studies
and legislation regulating trapping. Developments since Dr.
Vinter’s pioneering study are summarized in the foreword to
the third edition as follows:

“In 1958, one year after the first edition of Facts About Furs
was published by the Universities Federation for Animal
Welfare, England and Wales outlawed what the British call the
‘gin trap,’ known to Americans as the steel jaw leghold trap.”

“By the time the second edition was published by the Animal
Welfare Institute in 1973, Denmark, Austria, Chile, Republic of
Ireland, the Federal Republic of Germany, Norway, Switzer-
land, India, Gambia, and the remainder of Great Britain-—
Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the Channel Islands, Jersey
and Guernesy, had outlawed the trap.”

“Since then, Bangladesh, Belize, Brazil, Burundi, British West
Indies, Colombia, Costa Rica, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon,
Ghana, Hong Kong, Hungary, Israel, Ivory Coast, Jamaica,
Jordan, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Malawi, Malaysia, Mauritania,
Morocco, Mozambique, Niger, Portugal, Rhodesia, Senegal,
Seychelles, Singapore, Sweden, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo,
Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Uganda, and Upper Volta have
banned it, bringing the total to 48 countries.”

IWC ADDRESSES PROFOUND SCIENTIFIC
AND ETHICAL QUESTIONS

An unprecedented meeting sponsored by the International
Whaling Commission took place April 28-May 1 at the Smith-
sonian Institution. The report submitted by the Chairman of the
Conference, Professor Derek Ovington, Australia’s Commis-
sioner to the IWC and Director of the Australian National Parks
and Wildlife Service, follows, together with a few quotations
from the papers submitted by scientists, philosophers, and other
participants:

Report on Meeting on Cetacean Behavior
and Intelligence, and Ethics of Killing
Cetaceans

By J. D. Ovington

Background

At the 30th Annual Meeting of the International Whaling
Commission (IWC) in July 1979, the Commission agreed to a
specialist meeting to consider (1) Cetacean Behavior and Intelli-
gence as relevant to Cetacean Assessment and Management
and (2) the Ethics of Killing Cetaceans. A steering committee was
appointed to organize the meeting.

Financial support was provided by the International Whaling
Commission, the Institute for Delphinid Research, the Animal
Welfare Institute and the Governments of Australia and the
U.S.A.

The aims of the meeting, as given by the Secretary of the IWC,
were to provide

(a) a source of specific advice and information for the IWC for
use in its analysis, estimating procedures and establishment of
catch limits whilst whaling continues: and

(b) a unique forum for discussions of more general questions
of the ethics of whaling and their implications for the IWC. The
meeting was held in the Smithsonian Institution, Washington
D.C. USA from 28 April to 1 May 1980.

Organization

Professor J. D. Ovington, the Australian Commissioner to the
IWC, was appointed Chairman of the meeting as a whole and
chaired the opening and concluding sessions. The early sessions
concerned with intelligence and behavior were chaired by Dr.
Sydney J. Holt and the later sessions on ethics were chaired by
Dr. Lyall Watson. Both chairmen were assisted by three rapport-
eurs in preparing the minutes of the sessions for which they were
responsible.

Typed copies of submitted papers were available for partici-
pants, authors were given an opportunity to speak to their
papers prior to a general discussion and the lectures and discus-
sions were taped. In addition, several films were screened at
appropriate times.

The meeting was well attended with consistently over 100
people present. Unfortunately, since few members of the IWC
Scientific Committee attended, the opportunity was lost for con-
structive interactions with the scientists involved in stock assess-
ments and the formulation of IWC catch limits.

The Meeting

Richard Frank, the USA Commissioner to the IWC, in wel-
coming the participants emphasized the importance he attached
to the subjects to be discussed.

In his opening remarks, Professor J. D. Ovington pointed out
the meeting was an important development in the approach of
the IWC to cetacean management. Such management requires a
sensitive understanding of marine organisms and their environ-
ments. He explained that the IWC was seeking guidance and
information and gave a number of practical examples where
advice was needed.

Comments on the papers and dicussions are available through
the reports of the meeting prepared by the chairman and rap-
porteurs and the summaries of the two chairmen.

The discussions embraced the following topics: the difficulties
of defining intelligence and the relevance of a neurobiological
definition of intelligence; brain anatomy and evolution; tech-
niques of testing intelligence in cetaceans; research needs and
constraints with emphasis on benign research; the assessment of
the risks of whaling to cetaceans, people and the planet; cultural
differences between nations to the utilization of cetaceans and
the validity in these circumstances of a global ethic; communica-

IWC MEETING (Continued)

tion problems between cetaceans and humans and the inappro-
priateness of some tests used to assess cetacean intelligence;
social interactions and adaptive behaviour of cetaceans, for
example, in areas where cetaceans have become a tourist attrac-
tion; the impact of whaling on the social behaviour of cetaceans,
especially those with latitudinal differences in distribution of dif-
ferent components of a population; the nature and cause of
cetacean strandings and administrative arrangements for dealing
with stranded whales; behaviour of whales during whaling opera-
tions; the killing of dolphins on Iki Island and the need to resolve
conflicts with fisheries interests; animal rights; and the question of
the humaneness of whaling methods.

The meeting was characterized by a frank, and at times
heated, exchange of viewpoints. Participants at the meeting
included scientists who are studying cetaceans as scientific sub-
jects, representatives of the whaling industry who see cetaceans
as a natural resource to be harvested, representatives of the fish-
ing industry concerned about the effects of cetaceans on fish
stocks, conservationists troubled about the past and determined
to safeguard the future of cetaceans, philosophers concerned
with the attitude of people to highly evolved animals and
bureaucrats who have to be responsive to public and political
pressures. Only time will show if the exchange of views that
occurred will lead to the development of better relationships
between cetaceans and people.

In general it was not possible in the time available to discuss
the issues raised in detail. Much of the material presented was
based on already published information, but some significant
new material was also presented. Nevertheless there is a scarcity
of factual information and the data available are subject to differ-
ent interpretations. For example, the early evolution, large size
and complexity of the cetacean brain, the ability of dolphins to
participate in complex activities devised by humans and evi-
dence of co-operative behaviour between dolphins were gener-
ally accepted but participants differed in their interpretation of
the relevance of these observations as measures of intelligence.
A small number of papers prepared for the meeting could not be
discussed in the time available.

Whilst it was evident that there were widely differing views on
the need and justification for whaling there did appear to be
some measure of agreement on the following matters:

(a) no species of cetaceans should be made extinct and
human activities likely to endanger individual whale populations
should be avoided,

(b) human activities should not diminish the potential of ceta-
ceans to provide food, pleasure or economic gain for future
generations,

(c) cetaceans, as a common heritage, are a matter of interna-
tional concern,

((1) there is a unique opportunity to investigate communica-
tion between cetaceans and humans and every care must be
taken to ensure that this is not jeopardised,

(e) the inflicting of unnecessary suffering and pain on ceta-
ceans by human activities is unjustifiable.

Future

A meeting of the Steering Committee was held at the conclu-
sion of the meeting. The Steering Committee agreed to a pro-
posal that a collection of relevant papers should be published
through a commercial publishing company, with Ms. P. Wray
(Center for Action on Endangered Species) as editor.

The Steering Committee recognised that significant progress
had been made in clarifying issues and recommended that

(a) a workshop be established by the Scientific Committee of
IWC for further detailed examination of those matters identified
as being of greatest significance to the assessment and manage-
ment of cetaceans, and

(b) a workshop be established by the Technical Committee of
IWC to further develop the dialogue begun at the meeting
between philosophers and people concerned with the IWC with
respect to the ethics of whaling.

Excerpts from a Few of the Conference Papers

0 “Owing to the massive amounts in whales of what appears
to correspond to association cortex in land mammals, there is
strong justification for considering the brain of cetaceans capa-
ble of carrying out many of the same highly complex mental
functions as in the human brain. With the tremendous potential
for higher brain activities residing in the almost completely neo-
corticalized brains of cetaceans, it is one of life’s ironies that na-
tions engaged in whaling practices are, unwittingly, destroying a
group of mammals which in terms of their own form of intelli-
gence, may be even closer cerebral relatives of man than the
subhuman primates. Certainly the facts demand reconsidera—
tion of past practices and a more enlightened future handling of
the problem.”—Dr. Myron S. Jacobs. Department of Pathology
and Oral Pathology, New York University Dental Center, and
Research Associate, Osborn Laboratories of Marine Sciences,
New York Aquarium.

0 “ . . . I think it should be admitted that the provision of sci-
entific advice through the existing [IWC] mechanism is a deeply
corrupting process. It is that process which perpetuates the
myth that scientific knowledge is adequate to the task assigned
of applying the NMP, and which specifically condones the con-
tinuation of present whaling operations. In fact, the only situa-
tions in which it is adequate are those where stocks of whales
have evidently been reduced so far below their ‘optimal’ levels
that there can be no doubt at all that they should be protected.

 

“ . . . Whatever else they may be cetaceans are large brained
sociable, communicating and sensitive mammals with a broacl
range of emotions, and great differences between individuals of
a species and even in their small groups, with long memories
and strong tendencies to parental care and other forms of
mutual aid. This means, I believe, that the present species are
likely over a far longer period than human history, to have
developed a mental culture which we are almost certainly
destroying just as surely colonizers of the new world destroyed
local human cultures, even if they did not make the indigenous
populations extinct.”—Dr. Sidney Holt, University of California,
Santa Cruz.

0 “If man is the goal of evolution then we can also accept What
follows from that assertion which is that the justification of
another animal’s existence is its usefulness to man. This was not
an unreasonable position given the known world that gave birth
to this view of reality. However, the discovery of intelligent
man-like creatures provided an anomaly that has proved indi-
gestible to this view of man’s place in nature. I think we are see-
ing in the debate surrounding the question of intelligence and
language in both apes and dolphins, the scientific world adjust
to this new reality. This process is occurring of a piece with a
reassessment of whether man and his fellow creatures have
long term common interests that outweigh the short term bene-
fits of exploitation.”—Eugene Linden. Author of Apes, Men,
and Language.

0 “The most advanced in the animal world development of the
brain associative regions in some Cetacean, extremely complex
structure of populations, clearly pronounced (but not complete-
ly estimated due to imperfection of our own brain) highly com-
plicated behaviour—all this makes us to believe that intelligence
of Cetacean is the phenomenon which has no analogs in the
animal world.”—A. V. Yablokov, Institute of Developmental
Biology, U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, U.S.S.R.

' “Now that hard science has revealed such special brains in
whales, we urge all men and nations to go about the task of
learning more about them and what they may tell us about our-
selves and our own evolution. Destroying another entire
species is the most unethical, despicable outrage man can per-
petrate against his own planet. The holocaust perpetrated
against whales needs to be warred against with all the tools,
economic and otherwise, we can muster. In destroying other
species man is slowly destroying himself. In destroying our
neurological relatives we are perpetrating genocide and will
lose the knowledge of another entire world. What a price to pay
for limited, local, nationalistic profit and outright greed!”—Peter
J. Morgane, Ph.D., Worcester Foundation for Experimental
Biology, Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.

THE LATEST ON FURS (Continued)

Running on parallel tracks are greatly increased fur prices,
the concomitant increase in trapping wild furbearers, and the
surge of public feeling against the cruelty of the steel trap. At the
same time, science is giving us intensive studies of intelligence
and behavior of a number of mammalian species, the results of
which bring the conflict into sharp focus.

To give a sampling of information from the new edition:

0 Far more wild than ranched animals are killed for fur in the
United States. Over 18,000,000 wild animals were trapped
in 1977-78, while only 3 million mink and fox were ranched.

' Endangered species are still being killed in substantial num-
bers for the international fur trade. Ocelot skins are still being
exported from South America—estimated at over 30,000 in
1977—to furriers in Europe and Asia. Black market tiger
skins now sell for $3,000; a tiger coat represents 2% of all
tigers left in the world.

In Texas, between 1970 and 1978, the price of raccoon pelts

rose from $3.50 to $26.00, the number of trappers rose from

5,000 to 32,900, and the number of raccoons trapped rose

from 150,000 to nearly 500,000 a year.

0 The history of the fur trade reveals the depletion of many
species of furbearing animals, reduced to endangered status
or even driven to extinction by the demands of the industry-
This trend, pushing some species to near extinction when
their pelts become fashionable, has continued to the present,
in spite of conservation legislation and international wildlife
treaties.

° A recent attitude survey conducted by the Yale School Of
Forestry and Environmental Studies reveals that three quar-
ters of the American public favor a ban on the steel jaW
leghold trap.

° Siberian Lynx coats sell for as much as $150,000, while bob-
cat and North American Lynx coats sell for over $10,000 1991r
coat. Pelt prices have increased astronomically within the
past few years, causing trappers to seek out furbearers with

such thoroughness that many species are disappearing from
large areas.

The book is a guide upon which to base more humane and
enlighted treatment of furbearing animals and is available from
the Animal Welfare Institute for $3.00. Libraries and human8
societies may request one copy free.

WORKSHOP FOR HUMAN/ANIMAL
ECOLOGY PROGRAM

A workshop sponsored by the School of Forestry and Envi-
ronmental Studies of Yale University and the Geraldine Rocke-
feller Dodge Foundation was held February seventh. Its stated
purpose was to determine the potential role of animal rights
and welfare issues in the development of a Human/Animal
Ecology Program which would provide a scientific university
context for the study and resolution of various problems involv-
ing people and animals, particularly wildlife.

Dean of the School, Dr. Charles H. W. Foster, introduced the
workshop which was held in the Yale Club in New York City.
Dr. Stephen Kellert, who recently completed the survey, “Public
Attitudes toward Critical Wildlife and Natural Habitat Issues”
funded by the US. Fish and Wildlife Service, outlined the pur-
pose of the workshop. The fifteen participants included several
authors, scientists, television educators, a philosopher, a lawyer,
an engineer, and professors and representatives of animal
welfare and conservation organizations. They were asked to
address 1) substantive issues, 2) research needs, 3) educational
and training needs, and 4) policy and management issues.

Roland Clement pointed out that modern agriculture and
multinational corporations are chewing up what remains of our
resources and raised the question as to whether our short sight-
edness is is part of our biological make-up.

Craig Van Note called for a quantum leap in animal rights
with legal and ethical rights for animals as individuals and as a
group, emphasizing the right to survive. He referred to a new
type of inflation which is likely to get worse as the biological
clock records acceleration of extinctions. Citing lack of data, too
little and too late, his suggestion: “Send out a thousand
Darwin’s,” dramatized the necessity for greatly expanded action
by scientists.

James Mason pointed out that animal rights takes off from
the environmental ethic and recommended research from an
animal rights perspective. Animal exploitation, he said, should
be phased out. Citing Winthrop Jordan, he said the animal
hating idea is fundamental to racism.

Roger Caras blamed the elitist attitude of the human race
and the fact that animals are considered property for the failure
to establish an ethic.

Marlin Perkins struck a more cheerful note with the twenty to
twenty-five million dollars a year now being spent on non-game
wildlife in the State of Missouri as the result of a decision to use
part of the funds from sales tax for this purpose. He showed the
publications prepared for use in the public schools using this tax
money.

Tom Regan provided optimism, too, as he spoke of the enor-
mous activity in the past five to ten years with books, classes,
and symposia on animal rights, and distributed a bibliography of
recent publications on the subject. He expressed surprise that so
little had been said about fine art in this connection and listed
other areas: history of other peoples, systematic surveys, laws——
federal, state, city—and its social implications; wilderness, disci-
plined vision, logic, and moral philosophy.

Stephen Kellert asked, “How do we separate the ethical from
the scientific?” Michael Fox spoke of inner values and the over-
all imperative of the culture. All agreed that a basic biological
background was essential, but a number of scientists and non-
scientists stressed the danger of narrow science raised by Dr.
Clement. Andrew Rowan referred to the “myth of the unbiased
scientist,” and Hope Ryden told of the emotional outburst in a
scientific meeting on bobcats when a leading expert, Dr. Paul
Leyhausen, proposed a moratorium on the taking of bobcats.
Dr. Fox referred to the danger of tunnel vision in scientific pur-
suits.

All were agreed that a Human/Animal Ecology Program
addressing animal welfare and animal rights in a scientific uni-
versity context was desirable and appropriate.

NATIONAL SCIENCE TEACHERS
ASSOCIATION ADOPTS HUMANE CODE

A “Code of Practice on Animals in the Schools” was adopted
by the National Science Teachers Association Board of Direc-
tors at its 28th National Convention in Anaheim, California
March 21, 1980. The final language of the code will appear in a
fall issue of Science Teacher magazine.

Dr F. Barbara Orlans, a member of AWl’s scientific commit-
tee, and the Director of the Scientists’ Center for Animal Wel-
fare, chaired the NSTA committee which drafted the Code. Dr.
Orlans presented a workshop entitled “Plants, Worms, Insects,
Mammals—Classroom Maintenance, Projects and Code of
Practice” at the convention.

The AWI booth at the convention featured AWI’s Humane
Biology Projects, a comprehensive source of projects for
science fairs and the classroom.

BRITISH VETERINARY JOURNAL
REVIEWS AWI’S ANIMALS AND THEIR
LEGAL RIGHTS

A transatlantic view of AWI’s Animals and Their Legal Rights
is provided in the review of the book published by the British
Journal, Veterinary Practice, February, 1980. Veterinarians
may find the review of particular interest.

Since publication of the third edition, 2,720 public libraries,
2,910 chiefs of police and 560 humane societies have
requested free copies. The AWI policy of providing one free
copy to each of these groups, on request, continues. It is avail-
able at cost price, $2.00, to the general public.

Informative Law Book

“Those interested in animal welfare legislation are only too
aware of the numerous Acts, orders and by-laws involved and
the limited range of literature on the subject in Britain.

“Compare this, however, with the American scene in which
one author in ‘Animals and Their Legal Rights’ advises that,
‘For those who wish to do their part to alleviate animal suffer—
ing through law enforcement, the first step is to become familiar
with federal, state, county and municipal laws on the legal rights
of animals in their locality.’

“This book is a remarkable collection of American animal
welfare law, not comprehensive, but covering the main federal
and state laws. This in itself has clearly involved substantial col-
lation by a number of American authors and Ruth Harrison (on
‘Animals in factory farms’).

“Under the headings which include slaughter, laboratory
animal welfare, dogs, cats, horses, birds, marine mammals, pri—
mates and wildlife, the various authors have taken an individual
approach to their subject matter so that the chapters vary
between a chronological account of the achievement of a single
piece of legislation, a table of all state laws on a given subject
and the complete text of a law such as the Animal Welfare Act.

“The book is not intended as a comprehensive textbook,
however, and the amount of law together with the many
sources of further information is impressive. There is even
included some EEC legislation (on transport, stunning and farm
animals) and some English, German and French law relating to
experimental animals.

“The only disappointing part of the book is the bibliography
which, in attempting to include some English literature is sadly
out of date, while the American side is based largely on refer-
ences to legislature sub-committee hearings.

“Any minor disappointments are easily overruled by the
sheer quantity of information which would otherwise cost the
private individual substantial time and money to gather. The
book would be invaluable to a veterinary surgeon taking up

practice in the USA.”
—M. E. Cooper

 

 




       

 

ELEPHANTS IN UGANDA AND ZAMBIA
NEAR EXTINCTION; ANTI-POACHING
SQUADS HAVE LITTLE EFFECT

A scientific report just released warns that Uganda’s
elephants are on the verge of extinction and an October report
reveals that Zambia’s elephant population, too, is dwindling. In
areas where professional or volunteer wildlife guards are pres-
ent, losses are somewhat reduced, but poaching still takes a
heavytoH.

A survey carried out by a team under the leadership of Dr.
Iain Douglas-Hamilton of the International Union for Conserva-
tion of Nature’s (IUCN) African Elephant Group found that
poaching in Uganda, which became widespread during Idi
Amin’s regime, continues unabated.

Elephant numbers in their two former strongholds —the
Rwenzori and Kabalega Falls National Parks in western
Uganda—have plummeted from the 1972 levels. In Rwenzori
the population has fallen from 3,000 to just 150 individuals. In
the isolated southern section of the Kabalega Falls Park, the
decline has been even more catastrophic than in Rwenzori.
Here the IUCN team found that 160 elephants remained out of
a population numbering 9,000 seven years ago. In the north of
the park, where anti-poaching measures are still in force, the
position is less critical—1,200 elephants remain out of a 1973
population of 5,000.

In Zambia’s Luangwa National Park, a 10,000 square mile
wildlife reserve, an October aerial survey showed the elephant
population had declined from 90,000 in 1972 to a low of
50,000 animals.

A Zambian anti-poaching squad recently found a poacher’s
camp set up nine days previously. The take for those nine days
was 15 elephants, one rhino and a number of smaller animals.
The tusks and horn on world markets would have brought
about £40,000. The wildlife guards caught the hired marks-
man, five helpers and the ‘go-between,’ whose job was to orga-
nize the kill on behalf of the gang’s financial backer, allegedly a
government official.

The hunter was fined only £400, the equivalent of 950
American dollars, the go-between £450 and the camp workers
were jailed for four months each. Amazingly, all guns will be
returned to the poachers. The minor fines, easily met from the
gang’s purse, are the norm in Zambian courts. The law permits
five-year prison sentences and fines of £16,500, but such pun-
ishment is seldom exacted. Unfortunately, poaching is the best
form of living a man can make in Zambia. In two weeks he can
earn five years salary.

Understandably, the Zambian wildlife guards, living alone or
in pairs in isolated posts, poorly paid, and often without ammu-
nition, can offer little resistance to well-armed poaching gangs.
In fact, ten guards were killed by poachers between 1970 and
1977 and, according to one government representative, “a
sharp increase can be expected this year.”

Tragically, a number of guard posts in Zambia are now aban-
doned, and anti-poaching patrols in and around the park
almost non-existent. Volunteers help to man roadblocks around
the edge of the park and occasionally go into the bush in search
of the poachers, but their effectiveness is limited.

The IUCN team reports that if poaching is brought under
control, the elephant populations could recover. “But,” accord-
ing to Dr. Douglas-Hamilton, “if active and forceful anti-poach-
ing meaures are not introduced immediately, the Uganda
elephant faces extinction within a year or two.”

FELIX-WANKEL RESEARCH AWARD

The West German Felix-Wankel Foundation has announced
its yearly international animal protection contest. Any person
whose research work concerns experimental or theoretical
problems of animal welfare is invited to participate. Contribu-
tions regarding alternatives to animal experiments will be of
particular interest. The maximum award is $26,000.

Last year’s winner was Dr. Hilary Koprowski, a leader in
developing vaccines using cell cultures rather than living con-
scious mammals. For further information write:

BRITAIN GIVES VEAL CALVES
ROOM TO MOVE

Instead of rearing veal calves in undersized crates on bare
slatted floors in total darkness, Britain’s largest veal firm'has
developed a cheaper, more humane way of raising veal.

Quantock veal, which supplies about 90% of veal sold to
British households, now raises its veal calves in groups of 20—30
on beds of straw in well-lit airy buildings, with freedom to move
about.

According to Dr. Philip Paxman, managing director of Quan-
tock’s parent company, Volac, the new technique was devel-
oped becasue veal sales were down as a result of the cruelty
stigma. But, to the company’s pleasure, the system has proved
far cheaper than the traditional Dutch method.

“Loose housing works out to roughly £78 a calf compared
with £175 for the crated animal. The calves are more con-
tented and the meat is of excellent quality,” says Dr. Paxman.

USDA REPORT PREDICTING END OF OLD
FASHIONED PIG FARMING SPURS DEBATE

A report just released by the US. Department of Agriculture,
“Another Revolution in U. S. Farming?” predicts the demise of
the small farm hog producer. The report says that by the year
2000, three quarters of the hog industry will consist of factory
farms, each raising over 2,000 hogs per year. Already, there are
15 to 20 companies producing from 50,000 to 250,000 hogs
annually.

According to the Center for Rural Affairs, the report further
claims that factory farms are a more efficient way of raising pigs,
implying that the nation would be better off with a hog industry
resembling today’s poultry industry.

Small farm pig producers reject the implication. They claim
that the authors of the report resorted to some questionable
economic logic to show small farms less efficient merely to
rationalize the continued proliferation of pig factory farms. The
flaw in the report’s logic, the farmers say, is that it includes the
purchase of a new barn as part of a small farm producer’s
expense.

While the report recognizes the importance of Federal tax
subsidies, pollution control regulations, availability of credit, and
Federal research programs in promoting the growth of factory
farming, the small farm producers say, the authors fail to realize
that the trend toward factory operations might be interrupted
by a reversal of these same Federal policies.

According to the farmers, USDA and agricultural college hog
production research could be reoriented to help the small
producers improve efficiency and profits; tax subsidies to hog
factories could be eliminated. The farmers feel justified in seek~
ing further support in light of the fact that the USDA report itself
states that hog factories have generally delivered no better litter
size or feed conversion rates than the traditional small-scale
producers and have actually resulted in higher death losses due
to the crowded, high stress confinement environment. (Empha—

ILLEGAL POLAR BEAR HIDE TRADE
SUPPORTS COCAINE IN ALASKA

Global trade in polar bear hides is the primary means of
financing the use of cocaine in Alaskan coastal villages, accord-
ing to the US. Fish and Wildlife Service’s chief law enforcement
agent and state drug investigators.

The Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits the sale of raw
polar bear hides to or between non-native Alaskans. But a large
polar bear hide measuring 10 feet square can be purchased for
about $1,000 in coastal villages and, after being smuggled out
of the country, it would sell for more than $10,000 in Japan.

Besides Japan, the other large trade center for Alaskan polar
bear hides is the London Fur Exchange, where the hides bring
premium prices alongside polar bear hides from Norway,
Greenland, Canada and Russia.

Estimates of the kill range from 200 to 400 a year, but the
exact figure is unknown. Fish and Wildlife agent Larry Hood
says his seven-man force is finding it nearly impossible to con—
trol or keep abreast of the trade. “We’re such small timers, we
just can’t compete,” says Hood of the sophisticated hide smug-
gling and drug selling connection.

“There’s absolutely no protection for the polar bear right
now,” according to Hood.

“No”says Canada to a whaling moratorium

How can Canada do this?

1980 has been a bad year for the whale. Following the progress
made in 1979, this year’s meeting of the International Whaling
Commission—held in Brighton, England, July 21-26—proved a
big all-round disappointment. But the saddest event of this
meeting, and the one which most angered conservationists, was
the loss by a single vote of the proposal for a moratorium on the
killing of sperm whales. The villain of the piece was a non-

whaling nation: Canada.

Over the years Canada’s voting rec-
ord on moratorium issues has been
peculiar—to put it kindly. Since 1973
there have been several moratorium
votes at the IWC. And since then a
number of countries have moved from
the No camp to the Yes. Canada alone
has moved in the opposite direction.

In 1973 a total moratorium on all
commercial whaling was proposed.

Canada voted Yes and supported the
proposal with passion and eloquence.
Last year, 1979, a similar proposal was
put to the IWC. Canada abstained.
This year Canada voted No to that
proposal and No again to the call for a
ban on the killing of sperm whales, the
most hard-pressed of all the whales still
commercially hunted.

was 14 Yes, 6 No. Had Canada voted
the other way, the figures would have
read 15 Yes, 5 No—so achieving the
3/4 majority which the IWC requires to
make quota changes. Thus Canada’s
No spelled Yes to the question wheth-
er sperm whales in large numbers
(1,320 in the coming season) should
continue to be killed for their sperm oil,
a substance for which wholly adequate
substitutes now exist.

Why did Canada act this way? Can-
ada’s government-appointed advisory
body, the Committee on Whales and
Whaling, had recommended that
Canada should support all morato-
riums scheduled for debate at the IWC
meeting. The Canadian cabinet vetoed
this. It instructed the Canadian Com-
missioner, Mr. Malcolm Mercer, to vote
in accord with the IWC Scientific
Committee’s recommendations—
except where they were equivocal. In
those instances, the cabinet said, he
should support those scientists press-
ing for a more conservationist position.

The Scientific Committee’s Report
states that some scientists favored a
sperm whale moratorium on the
grounds of inadequate data and a
poor “biological model.” Other scien-
tists were against, arguing that uncer—
tainty varied and that a blanket mora-
torium was therefore unjustified.

However, despite this divergence of
opinion, the Scientific Committee rec-
ommended zero quotas in two out of
three areas in which sperm whales are
hunted. For the third area, the North
Atlantic fished by Icelandic and Span-
ish whalers, the uncertainties were so
great that the Committee simply urged
that the average catch of recent years
should not be exceeded.

3-year quota
on bowheads

U.S. now free to reassert
leadership

Most endangered of all whales on
which IWC sets a quota is the bow-
head, a species decimated by com—
mercial whalers in the 19th Century
and still killed by Alaskan Eskimos us-
ing a curious weaponry manufactured
in Pennsylvania which exactly repli-
cates that used by the Yankee whalers
who undermined the species’ sur-
vivability.

Nemesis of U.S. leadership in the
Commission is the conflict between
the Scientific Committee’s repeated
recommendation of a zero quota on
bowheads and the demands of the
Eskimos, backed up by court chal-
lenges for the right to take numbers
greatly exceeding those killed in the
1940’s, 50’s and 60’s.

Conservationist concern, directed at
U.S. Commissioner Richard Frank,
was expressed succinctly in the foot-
high words “No Bowhead Trade-Off”
which demonstrators outside the IWC
meeting attached to “Flo,” a 40-foot
balloon in the shape of the whale that
has haunted IWC meetings for the
past four years. The phrase refers to
the fact that Japan and Russia always
support the United States in getting a
quota on bowheads for Alaskan Eski-
mos, while US leadership in the
Commission has slackened since 1977
when the bowhead issue first came to
a head.

In that year the Commission voted a
zero quota, and lawyers for the newly
formed Alaskan Eskimo Whaling
Commission fought to force the
United States to file an objection to the
IWC decision. The issue was carried all
the way to the Supreme Court. Al-
though they lost the legal battle,
counsel for the Eskimos has heavily in-
fluenced the actions of the U.S. Com-
missioner. The Commission narrowly
escaped adjourning with no quota on
bowheads this year—the most dan-
gerous possible result for these endan-
gered whales. Finally, a three—year
quota, which represents a small reduc-
tion from the current quota, was voted:
:IS bowheads landed or 65 struck and
ost.

Removal of the bowhead issue
from the enervating quota battles
for the next three years should
make possible a reassertion of
U.S. leadership for the whales.

It should also make possible a
change in the embarrassing U.S. vote

The Whaling Commission— how it works

The International Whaling
Commission, born in 1948, meets
every summer to agree on whaling
quotas for the following 12
months: how many to kill, what
species and where. Ostensibly the
IWC exists to “conserve” whale
populations so that whalers may
prosper. In this it has failed dis-
mally. The whaling industry is
now in its death throes.

Far from conserving whales (if only
for the sake of the whaling nations),
the IWC has presided over the de-
struction of the great whales to the
point of “commercial extinction.” As
their populations have collapsed, so
the industry—through the IWC—has
striven to stay afloat by switching at—
tention to the lesser whales. Minke
whales were only marginally exploited
until recently. Now they are the prime
target of the whalers’ harpoons.

A more rational corrective to the
gross overhunting of the past lies in the
IWC’s so-called New Management
Procedure which lays down certain
rules to make the recommendations of
its scientists more “scientific.” This is a
great step forward—in theory.

In practice, however, the political
make-up of the Scientific Committee
plus the shortage of hard data too
often make for confused and flabby
recommendations. Presented with
ambiguous advice, Commissioners
can interpret it as they will. And

because IWC quotas have to be
agreed by a 3/4 majority, the whaling

lnations~though in a minority—can

prove and do prove hard bargainers.
In short, the New Management Pro-
cedure has brought few changes. Poli-
tics still dominate. True, the overall
quota drops year by year. But while
this downward trend is partly due to
conservationist pressure, it is chiefly

due to the continued failure of the
IWC to “conserve” whale populations.

Continued whaling will lead only to
the death of whales and whalers. But
while the whaling industry is past sav-
ing, the whales are not. Not yet, not
quite. A moratorium could just save
the whales. Nothing less will do. We
must all start working now to make

Whale.”

 

this year for a quota of 10 humpback
whales for Greenland fishermen.
Without the U.S. vote, this quota
would not have been approved by the
Commission.

Canada does not permit Canadian
native peoples to kill bowhead whales.
However, she unilaterally set a quota
of 40 beluga whales in the Cumber—
land Sound area, despite the fact that
IWC’s Scientific Committee recom-
mended a zero quota for these whales.
Canada’s rationale on this matter is
bizarre. In a vehement speech, Cana-
dian Commissioner Mercer asserted
that beluga whales and narwhals are
not whales and, therefore, must not be
under IWC control. Despite a scholarly
presentation by Sweden’s Alternate
Commissioner, Mrs. K. Mannheimer,
the Commission did not include belu-
gas and narwhals in the IWC schedule.
The struck—and-lost rate for these small
whales in the aboriginal fishery is high.

nick and Christine Stevens discuss the

Canada— Continued

The first thing to note is that the
Scientific Committee was itself split on
the issue of the sperm whale morato-
rium—with the conservation-minded
scientists being in favor. Given the
instructions that he had, it is hard to
understand Commissioner Mercer’s
opposing vote.

His vote is even harder to under-
stand in the light of the Scientific
Committee’s advice on sperm whale
stocks. In two areas this advice
amounted to an “unequivocal” call for
a moratorium. As for the third area,
the quota recommendation was very
halfhearted; grave uncertainties were
admitted—of a kind which assuredly
influenced some scientists to press for
a moratorium on all sperm whaling.

In short, the scientific position on the
three separate sperm whale stocks
served to strengthen rather than to
weaken the conservationist case for a
total ban on the killing of sperm
whales. Yet the Canadian Commis-
sioner, despite his instructions op-
posed it.

Of course it should not have mat—
tered too much. The scientists still
recommended zero in two areas out of

three, including the main plundering
ground, the North Pacific. If these
recommendations had been adopted,
the damage would have been con-
tained.

But that is not how the IWC works.
The defeat of the moratorium opened
the floodgates. Heedless of scientific
advice, quotas were set for all three
areas. In the North Pacific the Com-
missioners voted 890 male sperm
whales with a so-called “by-catch” of
11.5% females to allow for miscalcula—
tions by harpoonists.

Canadian Commissioner to vote zero

Norwegian whaling not
in accord with cruelty

laws

Most of the whales killed by Norway
are minke whales. Norway has good
anti-cruelty laws governing the
slaughter of domestic animals and the
capture of fur bearers, but the minke
whales’ prolonged agony remains a
blot on Norway’s reputation as an ad-
vanced nation.

Magnar Norderhaug of Norway’s
Environment Ministry, author of Status
80. Norwegian Yearbook of Conserva—
tion (1979), wrote: “One can claim on
clear grounds that the Norwegian

small whaling is not in accordance with
Norwegian law for the prevention of
cruelty to animals.” Norderhaug em-
phasizes, “Now that we know that the
whales are very intelligent animals
with a nervous system just as ad-
vanced as the humans’, this is, to put it
mildly, serious.”

Please write to Norway’s Minister of
the Environment urging him to press
for an end to commercial whaling by
Norway and, until Norway stops killing
whales, to require that cold harpoons
be abolished because of the long, slow
death they cause. The Minister may be
addressed as follows: Rolf Hansen,
Minister of the Environment, Mynt-
gaten 2, Oslo, Dep., Norway.

 




Cold harpoons— a small victory

The lWC debated a major cruel-
ty issue—“cold” harpoons. The
Commissioners voted over-
whelmingly (only Japan, South
Korea and Russia, opposing) to
ban the use of this primitive
weapon on all whales except
minkes. But since minkes now
make up the bulk of the IWC
quota, and since only Spain and
South Korea (among IWC mem-
bers) use the cold harpoon on the
larger whales, this partial ban is
hardly a great step forward.

Minkes are small whales which until
recently were considered too small to
be worth hunting. The explosive har-
poons designed for the great whales
blast right through the minke’s slender
body, so rendering its carcass unfit for
the Japanese meat packers. The

 

“The swing towards greater use
of the cold harpoon means that,
on average, whales taken under
the aegis of the International
Whaling Commission are now
taking longer to die and are in
greater pain than has been the
case in the past. The justification
for the wanton disregard of the
normally accepted animal rights
is that there is less damage to
that portion of the animal taken
by man.”

Professor Derek Ovington, Australian Commissioner

 

whalers have therefore reverted to an—
cient implements developed before
the invention of gunpowder—and in
the coming season more than 10,000
minkes will die slowly and in agony.
Prompted by Australian Commis-
sioner, Professor Derek Ovington, the
[WC resolved that at next year’s meet-
ing it will consider extending the ban
on cold harpoons to minke whales.
The Japanese are not pleased. Com-

missioner Yonezawa said that current
Japanese research into the “humane
killing” of minkes will not be com-
pleted in time for next year’s voting.

This is unacceptable stalling. Prime
Minister Suzuki can insist that the
research be speeded up. Write him
urging him to stop the needless cruelty
to minke whales. Tell him you are
boycotting Japanese goods and will
continue to do so while Japan con-
tinues to hunt whales in such a cruel
fashion. His address: Prime Minister
Zenko Suzuki, Office of the Prime Min-
ister, 1—6—1 Nagata-Cho, Chivoda-Ku,
Tokyo 100.

Dolphins too

Please also urge Japan’s Prime Min—
ister to halt the spearing of dolphins at
Iki Island. And again tell him you are
boycotting Japanese goods until dol-
phin policies are changed.

Japanese scientists have done little

work on diverting dolphins from their
migrations past Iki where overfishing
has led the fishermen to blame the
dolphins for past and present human
errors. The bloody, callous and totally
unregulated slaughter of the dolphins
is unworthy of a civilized nation.

Ask Prime Minister Suzuki to see
that the dolphins are successfully di-
verted from Iki this year. Demand that
the huge machine into which the
slaughtered dolphins are dropped and
ground into fertilizer be dismantled
and removed from Iki. Unless this
“Dolphin Disposal” machine is
removed, the dolphins will again be
bountied and killed.

Spain and South Korea
must stick to new ruling

Spain and South Korea still use cold
harpoons for 80-foot long whales, but
as members of the lWC they will have
to stop in the 1980—81 season or file
an objection to the new lWC ruling.

Failure to adhere to the ruling would
subject them to the Packwood-Magnu-
son amendment to the Fisheries Con-
servation and Management Act, and
they could lose important fishing rights
within 200 miles of the United States.
Senators Bob Packwood (R. Greg.)
and Warren Magnuson (D. Wash), in
creating this solid economic incentive,
greatly surpassed the effectiveness of
the lWC itself in offering a deterrent to
violation of lWC quotas and rules.

Portugal

Portugal refuses to join the lWC.
There is thus no pressure on Portu-
guese whalers to stop using the cold
harpoon on the large whales. Outlaw
Whaling, 1980, Greenpeace logs a
24-hour courageous and resourceful
struggle of a great sperm whale bull
against the unrelenting series of har-
poons thrust by Portuguese whalers
into the animal whenever he rose to
the surface to breathe. This senseless
cruelty must end.

The rage for cage birds

Wrw~~wCage~birds in huge quantities are beingwsmuggled into the

US- mostly from Mexico. Estimates vary between 50,000 and
100,000 a year. Although US Customs are now alert to the prob-
lem, the number of birds seized (3057 in 1979) is tiny in relation
to the traffic. And very lucrative traffic it is.

Yellow-headed parrots, for exam-
ple, bought in Mexico for $50 can
fetch upwards of $350 in the US. And
birds smuggled across the border
avoid both customs duty and the cost
(up to $80 a bird) of compulsory
quarantining. So smuggling brings a
nice profit. But smuggling also brings
Exotic Newcastle Disease.

This avian disease is highly con-
tagious and usually fatal. In wild birds
it may be dormant, erupting only
under stress. Most probably the erup-
tion of last August started in smuggled
cage birds which were sent to a dealer
in Miami. There, while incubating the
disease, they came into contact with

thousands of legally imported birds
which had undergone quarantine and
were awaiting shipment to pet stores
throughout the US.

By the time Newcastle Disease was
diagnosed these shipments had taken
place. The Department of Agriculture,
which supervises the quarantine pro—
gram for imported birds, then had the
task of tracing recipients. By late
October 29,752 birds had been
euthanized to prevent the disease from
spreading to poultry.

Outbreaks of Newcastle Disease oc-
cur almost every year. lnvariably
smuggled birds are the cause. As a
result tens of thousands of cage birds

fornia. Wrapped in newspaper and hidden under a car seat, they had all died from suffo-

cation.

have been euthanized and millions of
dollars paid to pet-store dealers and
owners by way of indemnity. (Dealers
who operate quarantine stations have
been known to ‘cash in’ on this ar-
rangement by introducing the disease
deliberately in order to claim on birds
sick from some other cause.) . .

Parrots are peculiarly susceptible to
this disease. They are also by far the
most popular of cage birds— so much
so that parrot populations in the wild
have plummeted and many parrot
species are now rare. Rarity, of course,
adds to the value of a species and
makes it all the more sought after. For
animal dealers an animal’s path from
rare to endangered to extinct is paved
with gold.

If parrot species are to survive, the
major bird—trading nations will have to
impose strict controls. Happily most of
the large bird-importing countries, now

South Korea objects

South Korea has filed an objection to
the IWC’s prohibition on killing great
whales with ‘cold’ harpoons. The ex-
treme and wholly unnecessary cruelty
of using such primitive weapons is the
reason for the ban adopted by an over-
whelming majority at the IWC annual
meeting last July (see previous In-
formation Report).

The objection means that the United
States could invoke the Pelly Amend-
ment and the Packwood-Magnuson
Amendment. South Korea would then
be denied both the US market for her
fish products and the right to fish
within the US ZOO—mile limit. The sanc-
tions should be enforced immediately
unless South Korea installs explosive
harpoons on her catcher boats and
withdraws her objection.

joy of the World Wildlife Fund about the
recent World Conservation Strategy, Jim
Barnes of the Center for Law and Social
Policy about the new Convention for the
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources, and Christine Stevens of the
Animal Welfare Institute about the 1980
International Whaling Commission
meeting.

Voices of the deep

Callings is Paul Winter’s celebration of the
voices of the sea. The melodies were in-
spired by the calls of 15 different sea
mammals—plus certain land ones such as
the wolf and the polar bear. The actual
voices of the animals are woven into the
fabric of the music. Marvellously evocative.
Along with the two records comes a 20-
page booklet with boisterous photographs
of whales, dolphins, seals and other crea-
tures. The set can be obtained from Living
Music Records, Box 68, Litchfield, Con-
necticut 06759. Price: $15.00 plus $1.50
postage and handling.

Horsemen Fined $ 1,350
for Soring Violation

A total fine of $1350 was levied against
Tennessee Walking Horse owner Peter
Livolsi and trainer Robert D. Morris, both
of Johnstown, PA., after the courts found
their horse ‘sore’ from wearing leg chains
and suffering recurring abuse. The judge
ruled that abnormal sensitivity and inflam-
mation was found in both of the horse’s
forelimbs.

$2500 reward for fisherman
$5600 fine for porpoise killer

Jimmie A. Barritt of Port Isabel, Texas, a
shrimp fisherman is the first person to
receive a reward ($2500) under the
Marine Mammal Protection Act for his part
in convicting a Mexican fisherman, Carlos
Diaz-Vera, charged with harpooning por-
poises. Barritt saw Diaz killing a porpoise.
He summoned the Coast Guard, who
boarded the Diaz vessel and found freshly
killed animals and harpoons. The Mexican
was later convicted, fined $5600 and given
a suspended sentence. He forfeited his
harpooning gear.

Livestock protection

The First European Conference on the
Protection of Farm Animals was held
17-18 April 1979 in Amsterdam. The pro-
ceedings of this conference form a special
issue (Vol. 3 No. 1, 2) of Animal Regula-
tion Studies—a multidisciplinary journal
sponsored by the World Federation for the
Protection of Animals. The publisher is
Elsevier, 52 Vanderbilt Avenue, New
York, NY 10017. Free sample copies are

Marine park for
Cahfornia

On 21 September 1980 President
Carter declared the waters within six
nautical miles of Santa Barbara Island
and the four northern Channel Islands
a National Marine Sanctuary. He also
prohibited future oil and gas develop-
ment there.

The Channel Islands provide one of
the largest and most varied assem-
blages of seals and sea lions in the
world. And they are a favorite haunt of
seabirds, including the endangered
brown pelican.

The new sanctuary was strongly op-
posed by oil and recreation interests.

In nearly eight years since the pass-
age of the Marine Protection, Research
and Sanctuary Act only two other ma-
rine sites— a coral reef off Florida’s Key
Largo and a ship, The Monitor, off
Cape Hatteras~ have become sanctu-
aries.

Animal Cancer Tests Under
Scrutiny

A recent National Cancer Institute study
confirms what the public has long sus—
pected: cancer is on the rise. In the May
issue of NCl’s Journal, the authors analyze
data from NCI surveys of cancer incidence
from 1969 to 1971 and from 1973 to 1976
and conclude that cancer had increased by
9% among white males and by 14%
among white females—a rise of perhaps
10,000 cancer victims each year!

While there is wide debate over the ex-
act cause of the increase, many scientists
believe it is directly related to the flood of
chemicals marketed since 1950. The new
study will thus place current carcinogeni—
city testing procedures— principally animal
tests— under even more severe scrutiny
than before. Development of non-animal
cancer tests has made some progress, most
notably by Dr. Bruce N. Ames of the Uni-
versity of California at Berkeley. We print
below the summary of an article by him
which appeared in the prestigious journal
Science.

Summary. Damage to DNA appears to
be the major cause of cancer and genetic
birth defects and may contribute to aging
and heart disease as well. The agents that
cause this damage must be identified.
Many of these agents are natural chemi—
cals present in the human diet as complex
mixtures. The tens of thousands of man-
made chemicals that have been introduced
into the environment in the last few dec-
ades must also be tested for their ability to
damage DNA. Existing animal tests and
human epidemiology alone are inade-
quate for this task because of time, ex-
pense, and the difficulty of dealing with
complex mixtures. Newly developed
short-term tests, most of them assaying for
mutagenicity, are discussed as key tools in
identifying environmental mutagens and
carcmogens.

 

 




 

Politics submerge policy in animal

protection merger

Politics seemed to be uppermost at
the meeting in Amsterdam on October
30 to merge the World Federation for
the Protection of Animals and the In—
ternational Society for the Protection
of Animals.

Of the 10-man executive committee
which will run the new World Society
for the Protection of Animals (WSPA),
only two are drawn from outside the
Anglo—Saxon world. The composition
is four from the USA, four from the
UK, and two from West Germany.

Although WSPA has a board of di~
rectors that is more widely repre—
sented, it seems that they will have
scant opportunity to give guidance to
WSPA or even to learn what the exe-
cutive committe is planning to do.

Mrs. M. E. Tait, an ISPA director,
now a WSPA director, bitterly pro-
tested the fact that the constitution and
bylaws were “presented to us without
voting or discussion.”

Ruth Harrison, the distinguished
author of Animal Machines and head
of the Farm Animal Trust, successfully
protested the attempt by executive
committee members to obtain blanket
approval by the WSPA board of a
budget for 1981 void of any details ex-
cept the total amounts to be spent in
the London, Boston, and Zurich of-
fices. The budget was not approved.
Rather a ceiling an expenditure was
adopted.

Ruth Harrison also led the success-
ful demand for approval of the scien-
tific committee by the directors after
examination of their names and quali-
fications and for the elementary right
of directors to decide when they would
meet.

What will WSPA achieve? It is
hard to know because policy on
animal welfare issues was not
discussed.

Mexican President petitioned on animal welfare

Extracts from a paper presented to
President Lopez Portillo of Mexico by
a group of Mexican specialists and
scientists on May 8 in Los Pinos.

As professionals in the field of veterinary
medicine, we are conscious of the need for
legislation to halt man’s aggressive and
destructive tendencies against animals.
Such legislation is of direct concern to us
because it is closely linked to the following
fundamental objectives of our profession:

0 Increasing production of food-animals
and preventing waste;

0 Safeguarding man’s health by prevent-
ing diseases transmitted to him by animals;
0 Preventing needless suffering in ani-
mals.

The fact that no legal regulations govern
the transport, handling and slaughter of
food-animals gives rise to major economic
losses.

In order to give some idea of the mag-
nitude of the problem, we shall cite some
figures. At the Tlalnepantla slaughterhouse
in Mexico State, 4,420 kgs of pork are
burned on average each month because of
the death of the animals during transport.
At the Ferreria slaughterhouse in the
Federal District, 18 tons of beef were
seized in 3 months because of trauma-
tisms, caused by physical violence to the
animals. The waste of these huge quan-
tities of meat at a time when hunger and
malnutrition are a constant threat amounts
to inexcusable carelessness.

It has been found that primitive slaugh-
tering methods, like throat-cutting without
prior anesthesia or stunning, mean that
large amounts of blood accumulate among

the muscle fibers, making the meat easily
contaminated. In bacteriological studies
done at the Ferreria slaughterhouse,
staphilococus aureo germs were isolated in
random samples of meat; these germs are
primarily responsible for food poisoning
in man.

The use of animals in teaching the bio—
logical sciences and as indicators of car-
cinogens in medicines and foods is current
practice. For the researcher, it is essential
to keep his animals under optimum hous—
ing and nutritional conditions so that study
results will be reliable. Our human con-
dition requires that experiments on labora-
tory animals cause them as little pain as
possible. It is therefore obvious that every
country with experimental stations and
laboratories must have legislation that pro-
vides for the proper maintenance and
handling of laboratory animals.

Wild animals are intimately related
to the ecological order to their own
region and therefore should not leave
it. In an artificial environment like a
human dwelling, their activities clash
with the new structure and represent
a risk to man’s health, both in terms
of serious lesions and disease. It is
also worth considering that those
persons who acquire wild animals as
pets are promoting the destruction of
the already decimated and pressured
wildlife. Those who deal in these
animals destroy a great many adults,
especially females, in order to cap-
ture a few young. Furthermore, most
of these die because they do not
adapt to captivity, so nullifying their
reproductive worth to the detriment
of the preservation of the species.

Killing whales
humanely?

Experts from various countries within
the International Whaling Commission
met in Cambridge, England, 10-14
November, to assess methods of killing
whales humanely. Participants re-
viewed the use of explosives, electrici-
ty, drugs, poisons and compressed
gases. Of these only the first show any
real promise. Japanese scientists are
developing explosive harpoons in-
tended to kill instantly by shock.

The new Japanese explosive, pen-
thrate, has a powerful concussion ef-
fect, and it does not destroy meat.
Scientists at the meeting put forward
various study proposals, but in the
meantime, stunning with penthrate
should be mandatory for minke whal-
ing. Where stunning equipment is not
available, minke whaling should be
suspended until it is.

Pirating exposed

Outlaw Whalers 1980 documents in
thorough and often horrifying detail
the depredations of pirate whalers
from June 1979 to July 1980 and the
operations of certain nations within the
International Whaling Commission
which brazenly flout IWC rules. The
most moving item in the report is the
log of the slow dying of a 50-foot
sperm whale. First harpooned at 10.15
on a July morning in the Azores, its
vain battle for life continues until 09.55
the next day.

Put together by Greenpeace, Out-
law Whalers 1980 is available from

Generally speaking, legislation ought
to prohibit the owning of wild ani-
mals by private individuals.

Without respect for life in all its
manifestations, there can be no mu-
tual respect among men. Good treat—
ment of animals is symptomatic of
good mental health. Cruelty toward
them degrades the person who com-
mits it and generates antisocial forms of
behavior. Therefore, preventing cruelty to
animals is a matter of social welfare that
lshould be backed up by the force of the
aw.

Forty-eight countries around the
world, including many in stages of
development less advanced than our
own, have legislation preventing and
punishing cruelty to animals.

Mexico’s full development de-
mands a constant refining of the rela-
tionships which we Mexicans main-
tain with our fellows, with the envi-
ronment in which we live, and with
the other living creatures that inhabit
our land.

 

 




Disgraceful distortion of
findings on ‘steel jaw’ traps

 

 

Animals Unharmed
by Traps

“A Michigan study of coyote
movements discredits the charge that
leghold traps cause undue suffering or
injury . . . No coyote has suffered any
serious injury.” (Northern Michigan
University)

Outdoor Life

 

 

 

The above extract from the magazine
Outdoor Life appeared in Fur Age
Weekly, 19 May 1980. It is a most mis-
leading summary of this Michigan
coyote study. Indeed it is a travesty.
We publish below the relevant facts
taken direct from source—an under-
graduate research paper submitted to
Northern Michigan University in
December 1979.

“Four radio-collared coyotes Canis
latrans were monitored to determine
home range size. Three of the four
coyotes died during the study. Two
died of starvation which was indirectly
caused by the initial trapping.” These
are the opening sentences of the ab-
stract—the summary of the aim and
findings— of the paper in question.

Let’s get it quite clear. Four coyotes
are leghold-trapped and released.
Three die, two of them from starvation
due in some measure to “the initial
trapping.” And two magazines say that
this “discredits the charge that leghold
traps cause undue suffering” and that
“no coyote has suffered any serious in-
jury.” Well, if dying from starvation is
not “serious injury,” then it’s hard to
know what is.

But we must be scrupulously fair.
The trapping, we are told, was only
“indirectly” the cause of death. Does
this mean that the real cause was
something quite different, so exone-
rating the leghold trap from blame?
For answer we must consult the main
part of the paper.

The first of the two coyotes was
trapped on 6 December 1977. Next
day it was radio-tagged and released.
On 7 February 1978 it was found
dead. “The apparent cause of death
was starvation. The trapped foot had
been badly torn and chewed, exposing
broken bones.” ' ‘

The second coyote was trapped on
30 December 1977. It was “kept in a
shed for three days and fed dog food;
it was then radio-tagged and released.”

4

On 23 February 1978 it was found
dead. “The apparent cause of death
was starvation. Its capture foot had
been chewed off.”

Our researcher points out that
heavy snow and subzero temperatures
contributed to the starvation of the two
animals. Doubtless. But snow in
Michigan coyote country is part of the
winter scene. And fit coyotes, that is to
say coyotes not painfully dragging a
crushed foot, can be expected to sur-
vive it. Clearly the direct cause of
death was not bad weather but appal-
ling treatment.

And all for what? The purpose of
the study was to “determine home
range size.” With regard to the two
coyotes which were soon dead our re—
searcher believes that “calculations are
very underestimated due to the fact
that both coyotes suffered serious in-
jury to their capture feet.” A third
coyote, a female pup, was captured in
October 1977 without the use of a
trap. The following October she was
trapped and killed but had in the
meantime “dispersed beyond reach of
the search pattern.”

A fourth coyote, an adult female,
was trapped on'4 January 1978. Luck
was on her side. Bad weather and lack
of a radio collar delayed her release for
six days so enabling her to recover. Of
the four coyotes used in the study only

for this one could “home range size be
calculated accurately.” But in view of
the fact that she had to move her pups
twice because our researcher “located
and distrubed the dens,” even this
calculation must be suspect.

Clearly the study was a failure. Bad
treatment of animals makes for bad
science because maltreated animals do
not behave normally. All the same the
main target of complaint should not be
the undergraduate researcher but the
two magazines which carried the
grossly inaccurate summary of his
study. To conclude that a particular
study supports the prejudice of trap-
pers and their lobby when in truth it
does the reverse is disgraceful.

Will Michigan outlaw the ‘steel jaw’?

“A person shall not manufacture, sell, offer
for sale, buy, set, import into this state,
transport, or otherwise utilize, except for
display or exhibition purposes, any trap,
net, snare, or other animal trapping device
which does not painlessly capture or im-
mediately kill its animal victim.” So states
MichiganHouse Bill 4783. A crucial hear—
ing on the .bill took place in the State
House, Lansing, on 24 September.

In the dock was the steel jaw leghold
trap. The ‘defense’——trappers and support-
ers of trapping—argued that opponents
are really out to end all trapping, hunting
and fishing, that the leghold trap is not in-
humane and that if only it was renamed a
foothold trap the cruelty issue would go
away. The ‘prosecution’—scientists and
representatives of humane organiza-
tions—based their case on the docu-
mented cruelty of the steel jaw trap and
the availability of less painful alternatives.

Dr. John Beary, AWI Vice President,
spoke for Defenders of Wildlife and the
Society for Animal Protective Legislation.
His method of persuasion was unusual but

highly effective. All eyes were on his
riveting demonstration of Newton’s second
law of motion (which he explained to the
assembly). His tools were a # 11/2 double-
coilspring trap and a pencil. The trap broke
the pencil. Those present were then invited
to put their fingers in the trap and leave
them in for an hour. There were no volun-
teers.

The scientists certainly made headway
at the hearing. And if not all the trappers
seemed happy with the idea of a Trap
Evaluation Committee, they could hardly
dispute a point made by Mr. Jack Sullivan
of the Michigan Federation of Humane
Societies, that ifthe steel jaw trap is not
cruel—as they claim —they have nothing to
fear from an objective evaluation.

Some trappers expressed interest in the
Novak, Davies and Swedish leg snare de—
vices. Based on the principle of constant
tension, these alternatives to the steel jaw
trap are effective and demonstrably more
humane.

One good hearing does not ensure the
passing of a good bill. But it certainly helps!

Shrimpers pledge help

Every summer and fall loggerhead
turtles are washed up dead on the US
Atlantic and Gulf beaches. 1980 saw a
death toll of over 1,850. But 1981
should be different. For the shrimp
industry has at last accepted blame
and introduced turtle-saving measures.

Chief of these is agreement to pull in
the trawl nets every 90 minutes or less
when turtles are known to be present.
Turtles trapped under water for longer
than this will drown.

The agreement was reached on 18
September at a meeting sponsored by
federal and state (South Carolina) offi-
cials and attended also by conserva-
tionists and shrimpers. The meeting
had been requested “on an emergen-
cy basis” by no less than 27 conserva—
tion and welfare groups.

Of course the best remedy is not to
catch the turtles in the first place. But
test trials on a turtle ‘excluder panel’ at-
tached to the trawl net have been
found to exclude too many shrimps
(20—30% of the normal catch) for an
industry hard hit by rising fuel costs.
Good news, though, comes from initial
tests on a new ‘trap door’ which allows
turtles to escape while not losing
shrimps.

Caribbean hawksbill

IS gomg under

“A fisherman can get $300 for one
Caribbean hawksbill,” reported turtle
specialist Archie Carr, Jr. to scientists
and conservationists attending the
IUCN Survival Service Commission
meeting in Gainesville, Florida, last
October. “Their situation is as bad as
Kemp’s Ridley.”

He explained that hawksbill shell is
semi-precious and will bring up to $70
per pound if the belly shell is included
with the top shell; Japanese buyers like
clear belly shell. Although the turtles
are now found only in deep water,

they are still being caught by fishermen
who will go as much as 100 miles out
to sea in open boats for highly priced
rock lobster and snapper. Any hawks-
bills that are caught are a handsome
bonus

Carr wants an international tourist
education campaign to halt the pur-
chase of all tortoise shell. A prime
target should be the Japanese.

Costa Rican TV
exposes slaughter

Last August a Costa Rican television
station exposed the barbaric way in
which turtles are slaughtered whole-
sale along a river bank south of the
town of Limon. Lain on their backs
with their stomachs to the blazing sun
and their feet sewn together to prevent
them turning over, the turtles are left
for a minimum of one week and some-
times for three weeks before they are
finally killed.

The killing method itself —slicing the
head off, dismembering the body, cut-
ting it open and throwing meat and
eggs into a bucket—violates Executive
Decree No. 9 which mandates sanitary
slaughter. Though the sale of green
turtle eggs is prohibited by Costa Rican

A Flippersholed front and back and tied tight, a green turtle vainly strugg

law, they are sold by the hundred in
the open market, peddled in the
streets and served at bars without any
interference from authorities.

Later the television station (Channel
13) interviewed the Chief of the De-
partment of Evaluation of Wild Sea
and Continental Fauna Resources,
Eduardo Lopez Pizarro. He said the
Minister of Agriculture had asked him
to prepare a new decree that would
abolish Decree No. 9 and replace it
with total protection for the green
turtle.

Notorious smuggler
indicted

On 7 August a federal grand jury in
Miami indicted the notorious Antonio
Suarez of Mexico and three other
businessmen, together representing six
corporations, on 13 separate counts.
They were charged with importing into
the US over 37 tons of Pacific Ridley
turtle meat—the equivalent of 7500
turtles—and describing it on customs
documents as Dermatemys mawii, a
Mexican freshwater turtle whose im-
port is legal.

On an earlier (22 July) indictment in
Brownsville, Texas, the owners of two
other seafood firms were charged with
importing and receiving more than
eight tons of endangered sea-turtle
meat.

The indictments climaxed 18
months of investigation by govern-
ment wildlife agents. Suarez, in par-
ticular, had long been suspected of il-
legal trade in turtle meat. In recent
years tens of thousands of Pacific
Ridleys have been slaughtered by
Mexican fishermen working for
PIOSA, the company he established.

On 7 September Suarez paid bail
and returned to Mexico on his own
recognizance. No trial date has been
set.

Planning for our planet’s survival

How to save the world

The experts are repeatedly telling us that
the life-support systems of our planet are
under mounting stress and will soon col-
lapse. But their message, though so fright-
ening in its implications, arouses hardly a
flicker of fear or even interest nowadays.
Impact has been dulled by repetition. And
besides, the long-predicted doom seems a
long time a-coming. Perhaps (happy
thought) the experts are wrong.

No, unhappily on this matter the experts
are not wrong. Agreed that for us western-
ers the signs of doom are not very evident.
But in the world beyond our own back
yards the warning signals are flashing:
floods and droughts from deforestation;
falling fish catches from overfishing; loss of
cropland to expanding cities— and expand-
ing deserts; chemical poisoning of life in
lakes, streams and even large seas like the
Mediterranean. And so on.

Biological systems can take just so much
stress and no more. How much is “so
much”? No one knows; but politicians,

 

Already for at least half of the
world’s population conservation
is now a matter of life and death

 

businessmen, farmers, fishermen, capital-
ists, communists, rich men, poor men—all
of us, in fact— act as if there are no limits.
This is a short cut to doom. Persistent
players of Russian roulette are soon dead.

Greed and short-sightedness are not the
sole culprits. Poverty and soaring numbers
can push people into trying to gain a liveli-
hood by methods which destroy the plant
life and animal life on which their own
future life depends. Being alive to the
needs of tomorrow (which is what conser-
vation is about) is of small help to those
who will be dead tomorrow unless they
can manage to feed themselves today.

What can we do?

Of course, not quite everybody reacts to
alarm calls on the plight of the planet with
yawns of indifference. There are many
people, even people in government,
whose response is a heartfelt “Dreadful,
but what can we do?” A national park here
and there may save the odd species; moni-
toring pollution may force industry to be a
shade more responsible. Such measures,
though, are like applying band-aid to a
haemorrhaging patient. But— what else
can we do?

How to save the world is a book which
tries to answer this despairing question. It
is the popular paperback version of A
World Conservation Strategy. (The
Strategy, published last March, is aimed at
governments and international agencies
and was prepared mainly by IUCN, the In-
ternational Union for Conservation of
Nature and Natural Resources.) The book,

6

like the Strategy, is more than just a
catalogue of Earth’s man-made afflictions.
It proposes remedies and draws up
priorities.

Conservation or catastrophe? is the
question posed at the very start. It sounds
like the opening shot in yet another emo-
tional fusillade aimed at the heinous sins of
Homo sapiens. It is not. The tone
throughout is cool and analytical. But this
can in no way disguise the starkness of the
choice before us.

The book does not cover everything.
“Living-resource conservation” is the

 

Only a minute fraction of the
world’s plants and animals has
been investigated for possible
usefulness in medical treatment

 

subject—a category which excludes the
crucial issue of population. Within the
bounds set, the first task is to determine
priorities. This should be on the basis of
significance (in terms of benefits to peo-
ple), urgency and, most important of all, ir-
reversibility (extinction of species being the
most obvious example). Agriculture,
forests, the sea, endangered species, are
“priority problem areas”. There is a
chapter on each of them and each chapter
ends with a section headed: What should
be done.

In all these areas a paramount need is
fully to integrate conservation with
development. Conservation which auto-
matically opposes all development is not
operating in the real world; development
which ignores conservation is not devel-
opment, it is destruction.

One snag, though, is that ‘destruction’
can bring short-term profits— while the
pay-off on conservation is seldom im-
mediate. To ask poor countries to protect
rare species—the genetic resource base
upon which future advances in medicine,
industry and farming depend—is to ask

 

To be more effective conserva-
tionists need radically to change
the public perception of their at-
titude to development

 

them, in effect, to subsidize the rest of us.
And that is to ask too much. International
companies (eg pharmaceutical firms)
whose life-blood comes from wild life
should help pay the costs of protection.
This is plain economic justice—and it
would strengthen the appeal of conserva-
tion to poor-world governments.

Waste is one of the main enemies of
conservation. And the most profligate of all
forms of waste comes under the innocuous
heading of incidental catch. Well known
examples are the huge ‘incidental’ killing of
dolphins by the Pacific tuna fleets, of
seabirds and Dall porpoises by the Jap-
anese salmon fleets, of turtles by the
world’s shrimp fleets—which land 1—3
million tons of shrimp a year and destroy,

 

unlanded, five times that tonnage of other
fish.

The problem is not insoluble. Prodded
hard by conservationists the US tuna fleet
has substantially cut the number of dolphin

 

Lack of conservation contributes
to the rise in tension between the
haves and the have-nots and
hence to global instability

 

deaths, while the US shrimp fleet (see
page 5) is now belatedly acting to reduce
turtle mortality.

How to save the world ends with a plea
to the individual. “Ultimately no conserva—
tion strategy can succeed unless everyone
actually behaves as a conservationist. Per-
sonal attempts to conserve resources may
appear inconsequential in relation to the
enormous problems. But such efforts are
among the most significant of actions, the
sum of which spread throughout society
will mean real and enduring success.”

Global 2000

In May 1977 President Carter directed the
Council on Environmental Quality and the
Department of State to study the likely en-
vironmental changes in the world as a
whole “through the end of the century”.
The outcome, three years later, is Global
2000.

The study takes the form of projections
which assume that present policies and
trends will persist. It makes sombre
reading. Overpopulation, resource deple—
tion, environmental degradation—in all
these areas the problems we face today
are trifling compared to the problems in
store. For although “policies are beginning
to change”, there are no signs of these
changes going deep enough to allow us
the luxury of believing that the projections
will be falsified.

Global 2000 is the first undertaking of its
kind by any government. It will give new
shape and more solid substance (or such is
the intention) to US “foreign and domestic
policies relating to population, resources
and environment”. Starting now. “If deci-
sions are delayed until the problems be-
come worse, options for effective action
will be severely reduced.”

Nor can these “problems” be contained
within strictly environmental boundaries.
For the study makes the very important
point—too often ignored by conservation-
ists—that environmental issues are “inex-
tricably linked to problems of poverty, in-
justice and social conflict”.

It goes on to say “New and imaginative

ideas— and a willingness to act on them—
are essential”. Quite so. What are the
prospects? .

Rabies and Wildlife: a
Biologist’s Perspective

by David W. Macdonald

Oxford University Press, 1980, £3.95
in UK, $28.00 from O.U.P. NJ 07410

Rabies is a dreaded viral disease of the
nervous system. In humans, if untreated, it
is fatal. It is a special threat to people in
crowded nations such as India, where it
kills about 10,000 yearly. It almost always
kills other mammals (except bats) that it
attacks. These victims include cats, dogs,
foxes (and many other carnivores), cattle,
deer, and New World bats. Rabid vampire
bats in Latin America yearly kill cattle
valued at $250 million. In the wild, rabies
epizootics rise and fall in intensity, their
cycles controlled mainly by constantly
changing ratios of individuals possessing
natural, serum-neutralizing antibodies.
Strangely, these antibodies have also been
found in animals that could not have had
any contact with rabies virus. A fox popula-
tion reduced by a rabies epizootic to one-
tenth will recover in about six years.

Macdonald, a British biologist and spe-
cialist in fox behavior, focuses on rabies in
the fox, for he believes that the nature of
rabies can best be understood if one stud-
ies in depth its effects on a single species or
species-group. He suggests that “any wild-
life management problem can and should
be tackled only on the basis of a thorough
understanding of the behavioural ecology
of the species involved.”

He agrees that rabies is most apt to flare
up where foxes are abundant, yet he con—
cludes that “mass-killing (of foxes) has
generally not worked.” He points to the
success of the Polish method, which is
based largely on biocontrol—the control of
life by life. When rabies erupts in Poland
and the authorities kill ailing foxes and all
stray dogs and cats, then let the disease
run its course, that is, limit itself.

In 1952 an attempt was made to stop
the southerly spread of rabies through the
province of Alberta. Largely through the
distribution of strychnine and cyanide
poisons, about 50,000 foxes, 100,000
coyotes, 4,300 wolves, 7,5001ynxes, 1,850
bears, 500 skunks, 64 cougars, 4 badgers,
and 1 wolverine were killed. “There are
depressingly few instances,” Macdonald
writes, “where the introduction of such
control schemes can unequivocally be said
to have resulted in the eradication of
rabies.”

Moreover, in Alberta “the number of
deer and moose increased greatly after the
slaughter of carnivores which had pre-
viously preyed upon them; this resulted in
serious over~grazing and consequent long-
term damage to the range, which reduced
its capacity to maintain big game herds.”
When poison baits are set against foxes
they kill not only foxes but raptorial birds.
What often follows? . . .fewer birds, more
field rodents and (supported by rodent
foods) more foxes.

Because the rabies virus persists in wild-

animal reservoirs, man can’t hope to era-
dicate it as he has eradicated the smallpox
virus, although he can soften its impact. In
Britain, however, the virus was wiped out
by 1903 as a consequence of laws which
called for the vaccination of all pets, the
killing of stray dogs, and the imposition of
a strict national quarantine. A pet dog
smuggled into Plymouth in 1918 started a
local epizootic which took three years to
quell.

The best hope for rabies control in the
future is “to persuade the foxes to vac-
cinate themselves.” It seems that foxes will
take baits laced with an oral vaccine which
subsequently takes effect either through
the mouth or the intestines. Oral vaccine
can be dropped from aircraft at a cost of
about six cents per fox-taken bait. The
resulting immunity—if I rightly understand
it—resembles the natural immunity devel-
oped in young foxes when they eat rabid
prey carrying the virus in its nonvirulent
stage.

Macdonald seems a practical sort. If
rabies should return to Britain he would
immediately surround the focus of the epi-
zootic with a fox-killing zone or cordon—to
thin the population and reduce the
chances of fox-to-fox contact—and would
surround this zone with another in which
foxes would be immunized.

As a fellow biologist I find Macdonald’s
natural, holistic approach to rabies control
convincing. Rather than continuing to rely
on seek-and-destroy methods, he would
use such biocontrol methods as are now
available, meanwhile seeking to learn all
there is to be learned about the ages-old
relationship between a pathogen and its
hosts. Victor Scheffer

The Wildlife Stories of
Faith McNulty

by Faith McNulty,
illustrated by Robin Brickman

Doubleday and Co. NY, 1980. $17.95

In the clarity of her prose and the sureness
of her instincts in writing about animals,
Faith McNulty joins a small, select group of
authors: Rachel Carson. and Gustav Eck-
stein come to mind immediately. She sets
a very high standard of personal observa-
tion, and in the course of her writing ex-
presses a view of fellow mammals, birds,
and other wildlife which is slowly growing,
perhaps only just in time to save great
numbers from cruel persecution and, in
some cases, extinction.

Some of the pieces dealing with endan-
gered creatures first appeared in The New
Yorker, notably the fascinating documen-
tation of the whooping cranes’ fortunes
over the past half century. The tremend-
ous dedication of a few of the people in-
volved contrasts with the callousness,
avarice and pettiness of others. The cranes
themselves are portrayed both as a species
and as unique individuals. After quoting
Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall,
“The good news on the flock’s growth is
heartening evidence that thoughtful men
can help undo the ravages of thought-
lessness,” the author writes, “Perhaps he

  

should have added a line giving equal
credit to the tenacity of whooping cranes.”

Other endangered species among the
falcons, whales, manatees and primates,
the lemurs of Madagascar and the edu-
cated gorilla, Koko, in San Francisco, take
their places in this broad-based book with
accounts of an American white-footed
mouse, a woodchuck, a starling, and an
entertaining piece on bluejays, which
gently debunks the idea that bluejays are
unduly expensive birds to maintain at bird
feeders. She writes that she can watch a
bluejay “gobble his 25-seed capacity with
an easy mind. At 15/100 of a penny, the
sight is a real bargain. It gives me a feeling
that is rare these days. It makes me feel ter-
ribly rich.”

Mrs. McNulty can rouse both uncon-
trollable laughter and deep sorrow, and—
especially in the story “An Oiled Bird”—
she subtly brings forth human traits that
militate against the acceptance of our
ethical obligations to animals. All through
the book, she touches with great delicacy
on moments “elusive of description” of
contact between her and all the different
beings in the book, from a tiny mouse to
the huge humpback whales whose songs
she listened to through hydrophones with
Roger and Katy Payne.

Failure to update current whale-killing
quotas and stances of member nations of
the International Whaling Commission is a
minor flaw in a book otherwise remarkable
for its accuracy, lucidity, fairness and true
feeling. Christine Stevens

Cage birds continued

including Japan, are members of
CITES (Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species). And
CITES holds its next biennial meeting
in February. At this meeting the US
and UK governments will propose that
all members of the parrot family not in
Appendix I of CITES should be in
Appendix II. (The UK proposal,
though, does exclude budgerigars.)

Predictably the pet industry is mak-
ing a great fuss. Last September an ar-
ticle in the trade newspaper Pet
Business exhorted readers to write to
the Department of Interior protesting
the “proposed ban”. The article was
headlined Plan to Ban All Psittacines.
This shows woeful (or wilful) ignor-
ance of the rules of CITES. Trade
in Appendix II species is not banned. It
is permitted—so long as the animal
carries an export certificate from the
country of origin certifying that trade
will not imperil the species.

The industry is also repeating pre-
vious claims that trade in birds helps to
prevent extinctions thanks to captive
breeding. These claims are entirely

 

 

Whilt (I‘lafls II

 

 

bogus. 90% of all birds imported are
sold as single pets. And few even of
the remaining 10 %——which go to zoos
and research—are used for captive
breeding. For example, less than 100
macaws a year are raised worldwide in
zoos, while thousands continue to be
imported.

The pet industry has established no
major captive-breeding center. Why?
Because captive breeding is formid-
ably difficult and because wild birds
can be bought cheap and sold dear.
The industry may argue that its ‘mark-
up’ has to be high because of the high
mortality of their merchandise. Cer-
tainly the death rate is appalling. Only
20% of wild-caught parrots, netted in
the forest or plucked from their nests
as fledglings, live long enough to be
sold to pet owners across the counter
of a pet shop. And most of these then
die within a year.

Agreement by the CITES parties to
regulate the parrot trade will not by
itself put a stop to this cruel and waste-
ful destruction. But it would compel
both exporting and importing coun—
tries to take a more responsible stand
than at present. The AWI is preparing
a substantial report on the bird trade
worldwide; participants at the CITES
meeting will receive copies.

Wildlife transport: simpler

rules, easier enforcement

The US now has just one set of rules
governing the import, export and
transport of wildlife and wildlife pro-
ducts. New regulations, issued on 24
September by the Department of In-
terior’s Fish and Wildlife Service,
draws together provisions of the En-
dangered Species Act, the Lacey Act
and various other statutes adminis-
tered by the Service. It means an end
to the confusing multiplicity of regula-
tions covering this matter; it should
also mean an end to pleas of ignor-
ance being sympathetically received.
The license requirements of the new
regulations are quite clear.

Wildlife carnage

Army, police and game wardens in
Zimbabwe have joined forces against
one of the chief threats to the country’s
war—torn economy—poachers working
in gangs and equipped with an arsenal
of weapons used in the fight for inde-
pendence. In Operation Wilderness
Warrior hundreds of poachers, spotted
by helicopters, have been rounded up.
Prime Minister Mugabe’s government,
acutely conscious that destruction of
the country’s wildlife will also destroy
tourism, has asked magistrates to deal
severely with these ‘ecological-cum-
economic’saboteurs. Wardens report a
startling rise in animal deaths due to
poachers in recent months. Zim-
babwe’s chief game warden has said:
“The problem is reaching crisis propor-
tions.”

In neighboring Zambia President
Kaunda is likewise taking a tough
stand. Alarmed at the decimation of
elephants in Luangwa national park
(“poachers aim to kill the remaining
55,000 within the next two years” says
one wildlife official) and the evidence
of corruption, he has said that “no
mercy will shown towards chiefs or
government officials found running
poaching operations.”

Elephant protection

stalls

Despite persistent efforts by conser-
vationists the 92nd Congress broke up
without the elephant protection bill be-
coming law. In its original form the bill
passed the House of Representatives
in December 1979. Senators Chafee
(R. RI) and Culver (D., IA) introduced
an amendment to the bill and in the
form under consideration by the Sen-
ate Committee on Environment and
Public Works, the bill was concerned
with both protecting the elephant and
enabling the US to strengthen interna-
tional conservation in the field. It de-
mands speedy enactment by the new
Congress.

NIH symposium examines alternatives to animal testing

Laboratory animals: a turning point?

Trends in Bioassay Methodology in vivo, in vitro, and Mathemat-
ical Approaches. This title of a 3-day symposium sponsored by
the National Institutes of Health may not exactly set the pulses
racing but what the meeting was concerned with was ways of
reducing dependency on live animals in the testing of products.
And what emerged during these three days in February was cer-
tainly exciting and just might prove a turning point.

The citadel of animal testing was
roundly assailed by a host of scientists
armed with the highest credentials.
Those under attack—representatives
of the chemical industry and research
and testing bodies—countered that
“substitutes will evolve, developments
cannot be legislated, money will not
buy a solution,” but the citadel no
longer appears impregnable.

Follow-up measures are already in
train. At the end of the seminar Dr
William Raub, Associate Director of
NIH, announced:

1) The setting up of a forum con-
cerned with testing and with the ques-
tions— what are we trying to measure?
Why? At what cost in time, money and
animal lives? The forum will include
representatives of all the parties con-
cerned—federal agencies, manufac-
turers, labor unions, advocates of
rights of animals, of consumer protec-
tion and of, safety in the work place.

2) The recommendation that re-
search and regulatory agencies focus
their attention on “the three Rs”—
replacement, reduction and refine-
ment.

3) The request by NIH that existing
guidelines on the treatment of (in par-
ticular) chimpanzees be modelled on
the treatment of human subjects in
experiments—in line with the “new

biology” adumbrated by Dr Prince dur-
ing the seminar. “The thread of life as
captured in DNA is showing a pro-
found similarity in all life forms” said
Dr Raub. “Ten years from now our
views on ethics will be labelled biologi-
cally naive.”

Salient points

Scientific, humane, economic and
legislative factors were all amply cover-
ed during the seminar. In his opening
remarks Congressman George Brown
(D., Ca.) said that while “respect for life
is on the increase, pieces of legislation
that purport to set policy don’t neces-
sarily solve the problem too well.” In
response to a question by Henry Spira
the Congressman said he would be

. -ax«.i ~..'

pleased if the conference would re-
commend appropriations for a pro-
gram to pursue the “valid goal” of al-
ternatives to animal testing.

Dr Victor Morganroth of the Food
and Drug Administration is Chairman
of the government Interagency Regu-
latory Liaison Group which has work-
ed for four years to “harmonize” the
maze of regulations issued by different
agencies. In this “regulatory night-
mare” the agencies sometimes call for
the same animal tests resulting in an
“enormous waste of animal re-
sources.” Noting that to repeat the
Draize eye test on six animals costs
from $15,000 to $18,000, Dr Morgan-
roth said, “Once you put a procedure
down on paper it tends to go on for
ever. Our committee is trying to adopt
the draft guidelines of the Organization
for European Community Develop-
ment.” OECD recommends that: a
local anesthetic be given when a sub-
stance might cause pain; a known cor-
rosive or strong irritant not be tested in
rabbits’ eyes; three animals be used in

THE CASE AGAINST FACTORY FARMING

Britain —factory farming
comes under scrutiny

Factory farming was relatively new in
1965 when Professor Brambell and his
colleagues undertook a Parliamentary
enquiry into the issue. They were shocked
by much of what they saw, though not half
as shocked as they were when they saw
how the Government had “watered
down” their recommendations to appease
the farming lobby. These recommenda-
tions, if implemented, would have out-
lawed most modern husbandry methods,
including crated veal calves and tethered
sows.

But while the producers and the wel-
farists remain locked in mortal combat, the
two sides accusing each other of, re-
spectively, sentimentality and greed, some
interesting developments have been taking
place both in Britain and in mainland Eu-
rope. A group of pioneering scientists and
enlightened farmers have been making
discoveries about animal behavior which
show that forcing the pace of Nature not
only causes suffering but can also reduce
the farmer’s profit.

Little by little evidence is emerging that
the paraphernalia of factory farming that
once seemed so convenient—the cubicles
that enabled the farmer to cram twice as
many sows under one roof as their free-
running herd behaviour would tolerate, the
veal crates that seemed so hygienic, the
slats that did away with the need for straw
and mucking out— might, after all, be an
expensive snare.

Official reaction to these discoveries,
which tend, again and again, to endorse
Mother Nature’s methods, not only on
humane, but more significantly on eco—
nomic grounds, is grudging and often
prejudiced. The Ministry’s reaction to a
five-year study by Volac, the veal pro—
ducers (showing that calves in straw
yards were significantly healthier than their
crated counterparts), was of the “it’s still
too early to tell” variety. Likewise while
Sweden as a nation has virtually aban-
doned intensive pig-farming after studies
proved that free-range sows lived longer,
needed less medication and produced
more piglets, Experimental Husbandry
Units run by the British Ministry of Agricul-
ture are enthusiastically weaning earlier
and earlier, even keeping tiny piglets in
heated battery cages, to force the sow back
into pig the sooner.

The biggest study carried out so far into
the performance of sows in various sys-
tems is that of Professor lngvar Ekesbo of
Sweden. His study, of 2464 sows housed
in groups in straw pens and 1678 con-
fined in stalls, has had a radical effect

2

on pig farming in his country. Where straw-
less, confining systems were once
favored there as much as they still are
here, now 85% of sows in Sweden are
once again reared on straw in pens.

Ekesbo found that the sows allowed
freedom of movement and straw were
twice as healthy as those confined. Of the
“free” animals 12.8% experienced some
health problem, while among the confined
animals the proportion rose to 24%. When
giving birth only 2.3% of the free animals
took longer than eight hours, compared
with 5.4% of the confined sows. Just over
10% of the sows in pens needed medical
treatment, as against 16.8% in stalls. The
rate of stillborn piglets was higher in the
confined sows, with the number of
mummified, shrivelled piglets born seven
times higher. Traumatic injury was likewise
far higher in the confined group. Only
0.8% of the penned sows experienced this
type of injury, compared with 6.1% of
sows in stalls.

Gerrit van Putten, a Dutchman, has also
studied the behavior of sows. His findings
show that while the degree of lighting on
a pig farm has no significant effect on
behavior, the presence of even a minute
amount of straw does. Pigs totally de-
prived of straw showed aggression to-
wards their fellows on average every two
minutes. After being provided with only
100 gms of straw each the picture changed
dramatically. While tail-biting, a phenom-
enon dreaded by the farmer as it quickly
contaminates the carcass, occurred among
18% of the pigs who had no straw, among
those with straw it affected only 5%. On
conflict behavior— nibbling other pigs—the
disparity was more dramatic, with 45%
of the pigs without straw participating, as
against 13% who had straw.

THE CASE AGAINST FACTORY FARMING

Hedley Hawkins, a successful Norfolk
pig-farmer with 25 years experience, has
tried and rejected the straw-free slats, the
early weaning espoused so eagerly by
workers at the Experimental Husbandry
Unit just down the road at Terrington St,
Clements, and now, having come back to
more “natural” methods, describes the
Ministry of Agriculture System as “10
years out of date.”

Hawkins, who farms 2100 sows, 1400
of which live in old—fashioned free-range
luxury on the sandy soil of his farm just
outside Norfolk’s Kings Lynn, believes the
farmer should ignore the blandishments of
the equipment manufacturers and invest
what money he has in pigs, not plant. His
experience bears out entirely the findings
of Ekesbo—that allowing sows freedom of
movement and resisting the temptation to
force too many pigs per year from them
will lead in the end to fitter, longer-living
sows and therefore more piglets per sow.

No tail-biting problems

Unlike the breeding pigs in the Ministry
Unit his sows are not tethered. The inside
ones live in pens of five, on sweet-smelling
straw— sows he says are extremely fastidi-
ous once their habits are understood. He
has no tail-biting problems because his
stocking density is right and the sows all
know each other. Tethering, in his opinion,
is cruel and unnatural, and leads to foot
lesions, prolapses and back problems as
the sow seeks constantly to find a new spot
for her foot.

He says he is regarded as a “bit of a
nutter” because he keeps pigs outside, a
practice, he says with a hint of irony, that
is now unfashionable. Stressing that to do
it you have to have a light soil, he points
out that while to set up an intensive system
with stalls, slats and slurry pumps costs
£1500 per sow, to set up an extensive unit
costs between £220 and £250 per animal.
“If you only have £100,000 to spend
you’ll be able to get a lot more pigs if you
go extensive.”

Professor John Webster of the Depart-
ment of Veterinary Medicine at the Univer-
sity of Bristol has spent the last five years
studying the behavior of veal calves reared
in crates, compared with those reared 1.“
straw yards. Like Ekesbo with pigS, .1115
findings have revolutionized veal rearing
methods in Britain where 75% of Veal
calves are now reared in this manner.

Stressing that he is a scientist, not a wel-
fare campaigner, Webster admits that the
findinQs—that calves mingling togeth?r
and feeding themselves from an automatlc
dispenser are healthier than their crated,
segregated counterparts—surprised litm-
“The intensivists argue that it is in the in-

terests of the animals to keep them teth-
ered or in individual crates to prevent
disease, but the straw yard method shows
that this is manifestly untrue.”

Webster found that diarrhea and pneu-
monia, the two diseases that commonly af-
flict calves—which, unlike pigs and chick-
ens, are not disease-free stock bred on the
premises, but are brought in from markets
all round the country—went down mar-
kedly in the straw yards. Vets’ bills for
calves in the straw yard system were about
a third of those incurred by the crated
animals. While 22% of the straw-yard
calves needed some form of veterinary at-
tention, in crates the figure was 55%.

Webster’s explanation for the improved
health of the calves, in spite of their being
able to touch and groom each other, is that
the straw yard is more natural. “If they
were in the field with their mothers they
would suck from them about 16 times a
day— exactly the way they use the feeder.
In the crates they were fed twice daily from
a bucket. Taking all that half day’s feed
down in 45 seconds overloaded the gut
and allowed bacteria to colonize at a time
when the calves had virtually no natural
immunity.” The drop in respiratory ail-
ments he attributes to the bigger airier
buildings using natural ventilation.

Cheaper and more humane

His verdict on the straw-yard system is
certainly that it is cheaper, with lower labor
costs, far lower building costs and—without
the need for heat or automatic ventila-
tion— greatly reduced running costs. He is
also pleased that it is the “humane” alter—
native which has triumphed. One of the
aspects of crating which distressed him
was that calves could not chew the cud
and instead would lick the walls and bars
of their cage for up to 10 hours a day. “Our
experiment has exploded a few myths—
that if you let a calf chew straw the meat
will darken; that if you let it mix with its
fellows they will cross-infect each other.
The old farm-animal welfare codes state
that a basic necessity for animal welfare is
the provision of a husbandry system ap-
propriate to the health and behavioral
needs of the animal. In my opinion the old
crate system did not fulfil either and the
straw yard fulfils both.”

While in pig and veal farming the new
findings indicate that methods of hus-
bandry which take more account of the
animal’s needs are more economic, the
picture is reversed when it comes to egg
production. Nevertheless the market in
free-range eggs is booming with more and
more of the supermarket chains begging
producers to step up their output—a fact
which would seem to suggest to the pessi-
mists in the National Farmers’ Union that

THE CASE AGAINST FACTORY FARMIN

 

Good new method of housing calves by Quantock Veal

a sizeable number of people would be
prepared to pay more for a product which
they believed to be tastier, more nutritious
and produced in less disturbing cir-
cumstances than the battery egg.

Aware of this growing lobby the Govern-
ment has recently voted a small amount of
money for research into alternative meth—
ods of egg production; and an aviary sys-
tem, where the hens are free to perch,
peck and dustbath is currently being stud-
ied at the Ministry’s Experimental Hus-
bandry Unit at Gleadethorpe, Lincs.

Martin Pitts, a chicken farmer in the little
hamlet of Pusey, just outside Marlborough,
Wilts, has in fact been making a substantial
living out of his version of the aviary for
just over 15 years. As the largest free-
range egg farmer in the country— his hens
produce around 2000 eggs a day— he
makes no bones about the drawbacks. It is
expensive—costing 50% more than bat-
tery production. Because the birds are in
contact with their droppings there is more
of a problem with disease; because the
birds can use runs, there are parasites.
They eat more— and waste more—than do
battery—reared birds. There is also more
pecking and bullying and sick birds are
more difficult to locate.

Nevertheless many of the problems al-
ready being predicted by Ministry officials
for the Gleadethorpe experiment just don’t
exist. Birds on higher perches defecating
on birds beneath them isn’t a problem ow-
ing to the oil in the feathers and the con-
stant preening, and even an amateur can
see how fit and glossy the birds are, com-
pared to their caged cousins, who have fre-

do not preen what is left. The dirtiness of
the eggs, a problem stressed over and over
by battery supporters, is greatly exag-
gerated.

Pitts knows quite a lot about battery
hens as at present he buys birds at the end
of their caged life to tide him over with big
eggs while his pullets are growing. “They
are in a dreadful state when they arrive.
They’ve produced 270 eggs in 350 days.
That’s pushing nature as far as you can.
They’ve often got broken bones and
wings—they’ve deprived themselves of
calcium to keep up this hectic rate of egg
production. They can’t walk. They can’t fly.
Sometimes it seems cruel to expect them
to acclimatize.”

Phillip Brown, chief vet of the RSPCA,
is convinced that hens suffer psychologi-
cally in their cramped cages. “Because
they cannot perch, dustbath or nest they
go in for displacement behavior, man-
nerisms which they have invented because
of their barren environment. Head
shaking, pacing, shivering. You get the
same thing with calves and sows. At the
end of the day when you see birds that
have been in cages for 10 months their
physical condition sums it all up. They are
fit only for pies and soups.”

To people who believe we are asking
too much of Nature on our modern farms
the lessons of people like Ekesbo, Webster
and Hawkins seem so simple. How long
before the Establishment sees the light?

THE CASE AGAINST FACTORY

Modern pig-rearing
methods compared

An investigation into the effects of modern
pig-rearing methods on the well-being and
health of pigs—submitted to the World
Federation for the Protection of Animals
by B. Sommer, H.H. Sambraus and H.
Krausslich, veterinarians at Munich Univer-
sity. Their report has been summarized.
The principal aim of modern rearing
systems is to house animals in a labor-
saving manner and to make intensive
farming profitable. Pigs are usually kept in
solitary confinement and without bedding.
Narrow box stalls or tight tethering se-
verely limit movement and prevent them
from turning round; runs and pasture are
denied them. By strictly economic cri-
teria— number in litter, size, productivity—
these modern rearing systems may com-
pare well enough with previous methods.
But do they prove well-being? An investi-
gation of this issue has been undertaken
and completed.

Mourning

The behavior of sows intensively reared
in solitary confinement (box stalls without
bedding) was compared with that of sows
reared in groups. In solitary pigs, ‘natural’
movements (burrowing, chewing, biting)
were carried out either without a substitute
object or on unsuitable objects. Rubbing
the bridge of the nose, ‘empty’ chewing
and bar-biting were frequent and extreme
in box-stall rearing. These substitute activ-
ities diminished as the system became
more natural.

‘Mourning’ describes the expression and
posture of sows sitting for long periods in
box stalls— head hanging low or supported
on a bar, eyes tight shut. In groups, sows
sit for only a few minutes; it is merely a
transitory position while getting up. For
solitary pigs, sitting is the clumsy and
lengthy transition from standing to lying;
mourning can last for hours.

FARMING ‘ .

The various activities preparatory to
lying down—scraping, burrowing and the
like—are more frequent and more drawn-
out in pigs kept in solitary confinement.
Biting the bars, empty chewing etc. are
expressions of an increased level of excite-
ment caused by the suppression of in-
stinctive drives. There is no proper outlet
for their natural behavioral needs.

Young sows are usually reared in
groups and placed in solitary confinement
at around 10 months old. To test the effect
of confinement on younger animals, 16
sows aged 5-6 months were placed in stalls
and farrowed about seven weeks later.
Only two of the 16 escaped injury or in-
fertility or difficulties during the act of birth.
It follows that solitary confinement usually
begins at an age which is barely tolerable
for the animals.

Poultry farmers
give evidence

Intensive livestock farming with the focus
on animal welfare has been the subject of a
Parliamentary enquiry in Britain. Con-
sumers, producers, welfare bodies—in re-
cent months all have given evidence to a
Commons Select Committee and those on
the committee have visited a variety of
farms practising a variety of systems. Their
report, embodying recommendations to
Parliament, will be published in July.

On 5 March it was the turn of the British
Poultry Federation to give evidence and
an AWI representative attended the hear-
ing. Spokesmen for the federation agreed
there was no hard evidence to support the
oft-repeated claim that the battery system
is the most economic. While defending the
system as giving “adequate welfare” they
also agreed, under pressure from the com-
mittee, that a system giving birds more
freedom of movement would be more
humane and, if economically sound,
would be acceptable to poultry farmers.
(Economic considerations include the fear
of being swamped by cheap imported eggs
from France and Holland.)

A welfare code lays down guidelines but
is not mandatory. Again the federation
agreed that practices which are in all cases
needless and abhorrent— eg de-winging,
de-beaking, castration without anesthe-
sia—should be made illegal. Beak trim-
ming, though, as opposed to de-beaking,
was defended as a sometimes necessary
form of “multilateral disarmament” in
caged poultry the pecking order may take
a vicious form. The code requires that birds
have room to stretch—which in cages they
do not. It was rather lamely said that bat-
tery birds show no signs of wishing to in-
dulge themselves in this way but that if

    

THE CASE AGAINST FACTORY FARMING

they felt like it they could always stretch
one wing at a time.

The chairman of the British Egg Associa-
tion was one of the federation’s spokes-
men. The committee had visited his farm—
64,000 birds, five to a cage. They com-
mended him for his efficiency but ex-
pressed doubts as to whether just one
employee could look after the welfare of
such a huge number of birds. They were
told that in a highly automated system this
was not difficult. Whether they-accepted
this assurance we shall know when their
report is published.

The hog-farming
Secretary lets his
sows roam free

The new Secretary of Agriculture is John
R. Block, a hog farmer in Knox County, 11-
linois. He was interviewed in January by
John Byrnes, editor of Hog Farm Manage-
ment. The interview appeared in the
magazine’s February issue and in a sepf"
rate article the editor writes of John Block s
pig-rearing methods, including the free-
dom enjoyed by his sows in summer.
brief extract from the article follows.

The sows and gilts are housed
separately until June 15 when the
125 sows and gilts that appear ti.) be
closest to farrowing are moved Into
timber pasture. The 10-15 acre 1335'
ture is mostly oak and hickory trees
with a small piece of open 9'0““ '
The sows find their favorite ground
and lay down and have pigs.

After about a week when 50 50“?
have farrowed, the ones that havent
farrowed are moved to another 9.35'
ture along with other sows and gilts
closest to farrowing. This process
continues in each of the 11 farrowlng
pastures.

Readers may wish to write the Secretary t0

express appreciation.

 




 

 

THE CASE AGAINST FACTORY FARMING

 

Book

Animal Factories

by Jim Mason and Peter Singer
Crown, New York, 1980, $10.95

 

Since Animal Machines first appeared in
1964 there have been many develop-
ments world wide. Expert government
committees have investigated the pros and
cons of the various intensive livestock
systems, national laws have been passed
and an international convention drawn up
among the 21 member states of the Coun-
cil of Europe for the protection of these
farm animals.

It seems remarkable, therefore, that it
has taken 16 years for a book to be pub-
lished on factory farming in the States. It is
written in a most readable and pungent
style reflecting the enthusiasm of the au-
thors for their subject.

The book describes the development of
the extreme systems in the States and
some of the pressures behind farmers to
adopt them. “For years government poli-
cies have favoured size . . . Most pervasive
of all is the bias towards agribusiness by
farming magazines, agricultural colleges
extension agents, and salespeople from
the companies that supply products to
agriculture. Together, these elements put
forth an ideal of farming that represents
their view of profitable or successful farm-
ing. The progressive farmer . . is the one
who goes all out for production and uses
anything and everything to get it.”

The new systems proliferate as many
problems as they seek to solve. One is the
drugs used to prevent disease and to es-
calate growth. Many farmers do not know
what additives are in the feedingstuffs
they use. Nor do they often know exactly
how long before slaughter the additives
should be withdrawn. This problem gets
carried over into another of the mammoth
problems— waste disposal. The practice of
recycling waste as a means of getting rid of
it profitably has meant that the drugs con-
tained in the waste go through to the
animals fed on it, creating a hidden hazard.

The book has very good sections on
energy use and it highlights the extra
energy needed in confinement systems in
which the animal is completely unable to
adjust to its environment: “For example,
pigs and poultry have more difficulty than
some warm-blooded animals in maintain-
ing body temperature. They easily get too
hot or too cold. On a traditional farm, they
could keep warm in cold weather by nest-
ling in bedding placed in shelters. In hot
weather, they could cool off in shady,
damp soil. In the factory, however, when
the environment becomes uncomfortable

the operator must use energy to adjust it,
otherwise productivity falls.

The section on loss of protein, feeding it
through animals rather than direct to
humans, covers well explored territory, but
there is an interesting quote from Ohio
University on food energy availability:
“Even the best of the animal enterprises
examined returns only 34.5% of the in-
vestment of fossil energy to us in food
energy whereas the poorest of the 5 crop
enterprises examined returns 328%.”

Hidden costs

Then there are hidden costs: ‘. . .costs to
the health of consumers who dine on fatty,
chemically dosed, antibiotic-fed animals
that never exercise or see sunlight; costs to
the environment from the accumulation of
huge quantities of noxious animal wastes;
costs to our limited store of fossil fuels;
costs to the starving, whose lives might be
saved by the food we are wasting; costs to
the land, which is forced to produce more
and more grain to be turned into meat;
costs to wildlife, whose habitat is destroyed
to grow more grain; costs to the quality of
life for small farmers who, getting no sup-
port from the Department of Agriculture or
the agricultural research establishment,
can no longer compete with big business
and must leave the land; costs to the ani—
mals themselves, confined, crowded,
bored, frustrated, and deprived of most of
their natural pleasures; and finally, costs to
our own self-respect.”

What of the future? The authors pro-
duce evidence that farmers are themselves
beginning to question the extreme sys-
tems. Some have found that, as one pig
farmer put it, “10 years of confinement
raises more questions than it answers,”
and have returned to more traditional
ways of rearing their livestock. Nor are
these systems less productive than the
more extreme ones.

In Britain around 40 % of veal producers
have returned to the straw yard system of
rearing calves, in which the calves are kept
in groups in well-bedded pens and fed
from the teats of automatic milk dispens-
ers. The pens are in naturally ventilated,
naturally lit buildings and the calves can
move and feed at will. This system is
proving as viable as the alternative veal
crates. It is not entirely a ‘welfare’ system
yet, in that the calves are still fed only a
critical amount of iron since whiteness of
the flesh is still aimed for, abnormal growth
rates are still demanded and, from the con-
sumers’ point of view, a questionable
amount of antibiotics and growth pro-
moters are used. Nevertheless, the system
works and solves many of the welfare
problems associated with veal production.
The system is the preferred one in Switzer-
land, and is also used on some farms in

THE CASE AGAINST FACTORY FARMING

West Germany, Italy and France.

In Britain the Brambell Committee’s
proposals for legislation were based on a
minimum ‘five freedoms’ and this, as an
easily administered regulation, might be an
effective start. “Every animal should at
least have sufficient room to be able with-
out difficulty to get up, turn round, lie
down, groom itself and stretch its limbs.”
There is plenty of evidence on the benefits
of litter for livestock and another effective
regulation could lay down a bedded lying
area for all classes of stock.

This is a book, not for the specialist, but
for the uninformed. The introduction
makes it clear that it is not the whole of
livestock farming that is under criticism, not
in fact the farmer at all—but only the
agribusiness mentality by which he is being
pressured. I could have wished that some
of the systems had been explained more
clearly and that within the body of the text
there had been more emphasis on alter-
native viable systems. But nevertheless this
is a welcome addition to the literature on
the subject. Ruth Harrison

A robin redbreast in a cage

Puts all heaven in a rage.
William Blake

One robin caged-and heaven’s mad!
But when to just that one you add
Vast flocks of battered battery birds
And half-starved calves in crated herds
And multitudes of tethered sows

In narrow stalls ——these horrors rouse
All heaven to a rage so wild

Its former rage seems wondrous mild.

Factory farmers used to state:

“Our animal machines are great!

The more they’re crowded (studies prove),
The less they are inclined to move;

The less they move (as studies show),

The more they and our profits grow.”

But now increasingly they cry:

“Our problems mount and multiply.”

But agribusiness won’t be fun
When earth and heaven rage as one.

 

 




 

 

Schweitzer Medal goes to

whale conservationist

The following is a speech given by Dr. Roger Payne on 5 February
when accepting, on behalf of himself and his wife, Katharine, the 1980
Albert Schweitzer Medal. The medal is awarded annually by the AWl for
an Outstanding Contribution to Animal Welfare.

Senator Paul Tsongas (D.,MA) who has
a fine Congressional record on environ-
mental issues, introduced Roger Payne.
He spoke of his pride in the work of Roger
and Katy, these “fellow residents of
Massachusetts” and said that the crunch
issue today is “whether men and women
can live in harmony with the environment
and learn to love the earth that nurtures
us.” Referring to the values which under-
pin the conservation movement the Sena-
tor pointed out that these are tied to man’s
self-interest—“not so much for us be-
cause we’ll probably live through it, but for
my child, her child and her child after that.”

By a happy coincidence the Massachu-
setts state symbol is the right whale—the
very animal which has been the focus of
Roger Payne’s recent work.

What happens to beasts will happen to
man. All things are connected. If the great
beasts are gone men would surely die of a
great loneliness of spirit. That remarkable
statement (made in 1884 by Chief Seattle)
expresses exactly what I sense will be the
most painful loss when “the great beasts
are gone”; and when we are condemned
to live alone for all eternity.

I have spent the last 11 years studying
right whales in Argentina and I have felt
each year a loneliness of spirit when the
whales leave and the bay returns to silence
and emptiness. It is hard to convey that
feeling but when the whales are there and
our days are spent watching them breach-
ing, spouting, swimming, courting, sailing,
pushing and shoving— all at their majestic,
glacial pace; or when I see them suspend-
ed and floating in the shallows, great

cloud-like beings drifting with currents too
slow to perceive, my spirits soar and I am
moved in ways that nothing which is small-
er ever moves me.

And then comes a day—usually in mid
December—when I awaken and look out
across the bay and see nothing. They are

6

gone—have departed in the night—and I
am left behind. Immediately the bay loses
its mystery and allure. It is no longer
unique but just like any other bay. The
annoying details of life reoccupy parts of
my mind which only hours before were
free and gliding with the whales. I feel
peevish and irritable—symptoms, I sup-
pose, of loneliness of spirit.

It is because whales are such grand and
glowing creatures that their deaths for

commerce degrade us so. It will confound
our descendants. We are the generation
that searched on Mars for evidence of life
but couldn’t rouse enough moral sense to
stop the destruction of even the grandest
manifestations of life on earth. In that
sense we are like the Romans whose
works of art, architecture and engineering
inspire our awe but whose traffic in slaves
and gladiatorial combat are mystifying and
loathesome.

Sei whale appears

Some years ago a sei whale appeared in
our bay. For several days our hydrophones
picked up its low calls in the distance, sure—
ly one of the most mysterious and eerie
sounds on this planet. And then the calls
stopped. A few days later we had word
that the whale had died and was ashore
many miles from camp. We mounted an
excursion to save the skeleton and trucked
the bones back to whale camp where we
stored them along the back of the beach,
beyond the reach of storm waves. But the
skull was too large to go down the steep
road that descends the cliffs to the bay and
so it was offloaded on the plateau above,
where it now lies, alone in the desert, out
of sight of the sea, surrounded by bushes.

In January of this year I paid the skull a
visit to see how it was faring, and as I sur-
veyed the “decay of that colossal wreck” I
thought I saw something move. It had ap-
peared momentarily at a round hole in the

base of the skull—the so-called foramen
magnum; that passageway through Which
the spinal cord communicates with the
brain. A few moments laterl saw it again; it
was the face of a mouse. I investigated at
closer range and found that she had built
her nest in the brain case of the whale—a
much more exotic consumptive use for a
whale than any we humans have devised.
This seemed to me to be a noble transac-
tion between a mouse and a whale. In ex-

Sei Whales

change for the shelter which had once
housed the whale’s vaunted and enigmatic
mind the lady mouse had filled that now
vacant chamber with a whole tumult of
smaller, more compact intelligences and
had then stuffed in a hatful of twigs and
grass to fill any empty crevice.

Could the mind of the mouse possibly
comprehend what an extraordinary sanc-
tuary she had selected for her nest? While
nursing her young inside that allegory-
filled cave of the whale’s skull could she
imagine sunless worlds beneath the sea
filled with slowly wheeling galaxies 'Of
phosphorescent creatures; or 6,000-m118
migrations; or towering icebergs? NO mat-
ter, it was good, solid housing.

I don’t fault the mouse’s use of the skull,
because, after all, she chanced upon It
Quite by accident. But it is curious how
mundane even the most exotic uses are to
which mammals, ourselves included, put
whales. It is as if we had a lapse of 5pmt
and could not figure out how to profit from
cultures other than our own. d-

Because whales now have so manila
vocates and have taken on an internation-
al lustre, it is not surprising that they bake
also attracted opponents among the ranns
of those from whom they might usua V
exPect support. One often hears that too
much time is being spent on such 913mm
ous beasts while myriad lesser known .SPe'
cies cry out for protection. And that is 0

  
  
 
   




  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  

course partly true. But there is a vastly
practical reason for concentrating on a
major species. If we wish tosave the apex
of a pyramid, we must save the entire
pyramid. If we are to setaside enough of
the oceans to ensure a viable population of
whales—the kings of the sea— we will have
to ensure a healthy abundance of every-
thing on which the whales feed, and
through which they swim. To save a king
one must also save his subjects since kings
exist only insomuch as their subjects exist;
just as the whales exist only insomuch as
the pyramid which supports them exists.

The irreducible minimum ecosystem is a
food pyramid with a single predator on
top. But it is a doomed ecosystem unless
enough such pyramids are preserved to
ensure the perpetuity of the predator. In
this sense a whale does not exist apart
from its pyramid. It is one with its pyramid.
It is the pyramid. It is much the same with
kings. The word king defines an office not

an individual. A king who has lost his sub-
jects and been dethroned has no meaning-
ful existence. He is like anybody else—lost
1n the crowd and soon forgotten. It is, I feel,
a good strategy in conservation to identify
animal and plant kings and then to guaran-
tee their kingdoms.

.While on the subject of kings and pyra-
mids I want to look at the totality of inter-
secting, interlocking, interacting pyra-
mids— the whole of life on earth. Years ago
thP: concept was advanced that integrated
animal societies which are made up of indi-
vidual organisms (for example ant colo-
mes) are in fact a single entity or “super-
orQanism” as it was labelled. It now seems
reasonable to many of us that all orga-
nisms and super organisms combine to
Create a super-super-organism—the whole
0f llfe on earth. The elements of this super-
suPer-organism though individually mortal
are collectively immortal, and the laws that
govern them are natural laws.

It is to this immortal oneness—to the to-
tality of life—that I sometimes find myself
praying. Would it therefore be outrageous
to call these mortal elements which are col-
lectively immortal, God? And to call the
immutable laws that explain them God’s
laws? If I take this step several things fall
immediately into place: for example I can
understand why I feel rage when a species
is destroyed—the destruction of any ele-
ment in the totality is a blow struck directly

 

I feel rage when a species is
destroyed—the destruction of
any element in the totality is a
blow struck directly at the God I
worship.

 

at the God I worship. In this scheme there
need be no dichotomy between religion
and science, since we can use science to
learn about God. In fact we can through
science beat a direct path to God, always
staying on course and never being diverted
no matter how slow our progress. This sug-
gests that rather than being threatened by
science, religion could find science to be its

strongest ally. One might even say that as
a means of understanding the works of
God, science is what religion has been
praying for. The distinct discoveries of sci-
ence, though produced by mortal human
intellects, are true fragments of an over-
arching, immortal intelligence called natu-
ral laws. They are unit ideas contained
within an incomprehensibly larger over-
arching idea. In this sense they are rather
like those mice nesting within the brain
case of the whale.

I have long felt that the love of all life on
earth (a concept that is interchangeable
with the word conservation) needs to be
written into religions—is in fact overdue to
become a religion in its own right. Should
this come to pass it would be a religion
with science at its root. We should not feel
that science is somehow an inadequate
base upon which to build religions. On the
contrary, science can uplift the soul, give
the spirit wings and teach it how to soar.
Science can lead us to revelations that
faith cannot. It can provide insights as deep
(perhaps deeper?) than those which come
through faith. Some scientific truths tran-
scend religious beliefs and illuminate God 5
works. In this way they are more like artis-

tic creations “which do not imitate actuality
but tranécend it and illuminate reality.”

In my own experience I have found that
at their best the revelations of science are
as uplifting, as inspiring, as the greatest art.
Though I am not a card-carrying artist I am
an amateur musician and have at several
periods of my life spent more time playing
chamber music than doing science. And,
although there is nothing I have enjoyed
more than music, I can testify that even the
intense delight of playing, for example, the
slow movement of Opus 59, No. 1 (or the
entirety of the last Beethoven quartets) did
not exceed what I felt when I learned
about black holes, or drifting continents,
or replicating molecules or the spontane-
ous origin of life, or even, I must admit,
whale songs. In fact these are spiritual de-
lights which compare favorably with those
deriving from religion and music—they
make interesting companions and do not
clash as much as we might have feared.

 

If we can fire the imagination of
the human world on behalf of
non-human life we will be living
in a more enlightened world and
will not be facing the prospect of
dying from a great loneliness of
spirit.

 

I have taken this detour because I
wished to cast in a new light the role that I
feel science can play in conservation. We
have long recognized the essential value of
science for resolving conflicts over how a
species shall be managed (for instance,
how quotas shall be set or hunting seasons
fixed). But that is just its journeyman’s
duty; we cannot ever hope to inspire any
major changes in how species are viewed
by humankind, and hence how they are
treated, unless we can inspire our own spe-
cies with a sense of the magnitude and
sweep of what will be lost if we fail to act.
The only route we can use to make the
kinds of discoveries that will inspire us to
action is through science—the best means
man has yet devised to learn about the
cosmos. If we can fire the imagination of
the human world on behalf of'non-human
life we can inspire a constituency for the
wild world which will rise, roaring, to its
feet and demand the rights of all life on
earth. If man can progress that far and rec-
ognize that he is not the master of cere-
monies but just another pretty face among
millions of other beguiling species, and that
all us species have bit parts—crucial bit
parts— and that it is no disgrace to have a
bit part if one plays it well, then the show
can go on. If this ever comes to pass we
will be living in a more enlightened world
and will not be facing the prospect of dying
from a great loneliness of spirit.

 

 




 

 

Lab animals continued

the Draize test rather than the standard
six; a substance be regarded as not tox-
ic if there are no reactions at a level of
5000 mg per kg of body weight. Dr.
Morganroth said it is routine to do der-
mal toxicity tests before the Draize test
and asked if a substance is “a dermal
irritant, why do the eye?”

Dr. Richard Griesemer, Director of
the Biology Division, Oakridge Na-
tional Laboratories, said that no more
than 300 substances a year can be
screened using standard animal tests
and that it would take two centuries to
test all those in commerce. He cited
one example in which 80,000 mice
would be needed to establish a single
datum point. He spoke of a 10-fold
variation in LD50 tests in animals and
a 1000-fold difference in testing iso-
proterynol in male Sprague-Dawley
rats. He pointed out that the testing of
chemicals is just beginning and that the
number of animals needed to test two
chemicals together is very large. He
characterized this as “almost not prac—
tical, but we’re being asked to do it by
our regulatory agencies.”

Dr Frank Schabel, Jr., Director of
Chemotherapy Research at the
Southern Research Institute which,
according to press reports, uses

 

10,000 mice a week, described testing
of anticancer drugs on tumor-bearing
and leukemic mice. Dr Harry Rowsell
of the Canadian Council on Animal
Care commented, “While I can sup-
port the need for animals in cancer
research [I am concerned about] the
end point when many are miserable,
ill, sick.” He asked why, when the irre-
versibility of tumor growth had been
observed, “cannot they be given a
humane death?”

Dr Alfred Prince, head of the Virol-
ogy Laboratory of the New York
Blood Center stated that the
“previously accepted distinction be-
tween man and chimpanzee is becom-
ing blurred.” He pointed to the fact
that “biochemical and immunological
data provide little basis for differen-

8

 

tiating these species.” He said condi-
tions for laboratory chimps range from
“relatively. ideal to totally inadequate.”
He urged that 1) chimps must be ac-
quired humanely—so ruling out com-
mercial exploitation in which “5-10
mothers must be shot to obtain one
baby”; 2) chimps’ special needs, in-

Pharmacology at the University of

ested in “reducing our total depend-

characterizing it as “a completely in-
effective model in that case.” She

it is convenient for observations during
development, the reliability of results is
good, the cost of purchase and main-
tenance is low, and human allergic
reactions are minimized.

AWI President, Christine Stevens,
asked how the animal testing system
can be truly safe and efficient when
most substances remain untested be-
cause of expense and lack of toxi-
cologists and facilities. She pointed out
that the United States uses more ani-
mals than any other country and
therefore has a particular obligation to
lead in developing substitutes for
laboratory animals and in changing
our regulations accordingly. Dr John
Beary of Georgetown Medical School
urged a prompt change in Draize test
methodology. “Right now,” he said,

    

“they could use a slit lamp. Oph-
thalmologists use it in their offices
every day.”

Dr Roland Nardone, Professor of
Biology at Catholic University, char-
acterized the prospects for non-animal
tests as “better now than ever before
because of the advances in tissue cul-
ture.” Dr John McCormack of John-
son Baby Products described in detail
an in vitro assay he developed to
detect water-soluble irritants. Cells
from a single rat provide the equiv-
alent of 48 rabbits which would other-
wise be used in a Draize test. The new
test has, he said, “a high degree of
precision, repeatability and accuracy”.

Nobel Laureate
speaks out

“Right now there is almost no
rationale for deciding whether the
mouse, the rat, the rabbit, the
guinea-pig or the monkey is going
to be the better model for effects
on human behavior . . . The one or
two or three hundred million dol-
lars a year that we’re now spend-
ing on routine animal tests are
almost worthless from the point
of view of standard-setting . . . It is
simply not possible with all the
animals in the world to go
through new chemicals in the
blind way that we have at the pre-
sent time, and reach credible con-
clusions about the hazards to
human health. We are at an im-
passe. It is one that has deep
scientific roots and we had better
do something about it.”

From a recent statement made
by Dr. Joshua Lederberg, a gene-
ticist, Nobel Laureate and presi-
dent of Rockefeller University.

Dr Mathhew Scharpp, Department
of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College
of Medicine, speaking on monoclonal
antibodies said they “give us a whole
new vista.” Homogeneous and pre-
dictable, they can be produced in vir-
tually unlimited amounts. “Once a
monoclonal antibody has been gener-
ated, it is much less expensive” than
using animals. He pointed to the rapid
growth of interest in the field, noting
that the technology was first described
in 1975 and that the 20 or 30 papers
on the subject of two years ago had by
June 1980 grown to 140. He ex-
pressed hope that the Food and Drug
Administration would give its approval
for routine in vitro assays using this
technique.

Nobel Prize-winner Dr Marshall
Nirenberg of NIH described mouse
neuroblastoma cells as “exquisitely
sensitive to environmental conditions.”
Dr Nardone commented that Niren—
berg’s outstanding work has prompted
the development of a system for
neurotoxicological evaluation.

. Dr Frederick De Serres of the Na-
tional Institute of Environmental
Health Sciences reported that an
evaluation of 30 especially promising
short-term tests for carcinogenicity was
COmpleted six months ago. Using 42
Coded samples, 11 of which were
selected because they were difficult to

that the short-term animal tests gave

transformation test gave 95% sen-
sitivity and 89% accuracy. Dr De
Serres asked, “How representative are
the 42 coded substances? Are all in
vivo assays equally insensitive?”

Dr Richard Cramer of Smith, Kline
and French spoke on “Quantitative
Analysis of Structure/Activity Rela-
tionships” and said it was not unusual
in his computer analyses to look at
several variables at once. He charac-
terized in vitro testing as “cheaper,
faster and cleaner to interpret.”

Despite rational comments such as
these, however, an impassioned de-
bate took place during the ensuing
panel discussion. Using phrases such
as “vain hope” and “criminally insane”
certain scientists showed themselves
strongly hostile to attempts to sub-
stitute non-animal tests.

Professor Thelestam from the Karo-
linska Institute’s Biology Department
reported on the Swedish National
Committee for Laboratory Animals
formed in 1979. New Legislation re-
quires that research animals be raised
for the purpose. Ethical boards have
been established to consider the im-
portance of the experiment, the suffer-
ing of the animals and “the three Rs.”
Anyone who wants to use animals has
to apply to a board. Professor Thele-
stam announced that in September an
international conference will be held in
Sweden similar to the NIH symposium
but limited to consideration of LD50
and acute toxicity tests.

Alternatives to Pain in

experiments on animals

NY 10017,1981.

$3.95 + $1.00 handling.

In this country a large proportion of
basic research studies use animals. How
much of this can be justified on the basis
of scientific merit remains debatable, but
certainly some portion of these studies
might be better done in alternative sys~
terns. With ever dwindling resources to
fund basic science, it would be prudent to
investigate the feasibility of alternatives to
animals. The major problem in addressing
this issue is the lack of a source reference
that not only summarizes current animal
research, but also provides a source of
alternative systems.

Dallas Pratt’s book is an important con-
tribution to the arena. The introductory
chapters consider the issue of pain and
suffering in animals (for example, whether
animals can actually feel pain); ensuing
chapters then survey a number of major
fields such as behavior research, cancer
and toxicology with numerous examples
of cruel and also humane animal studies.
Many of the animal examples are familiar
(such as the Draize test); the most valuable
portions of the book, however, describe
scientifically valid alternatives to the
animal tests.

An example of the general format of
the book can be illustrated by the chapter
on cancer. After a brief introduction of the
scientific limitations of animal studies on
cancer, such as the different innate sus-
ceptibility to cancer between mice and
men, there follows a lengthy discussion of
alternatives including the use of human
cells in cell culture, human tissues in organ
cultures, epidemiological studies, as well
as other tests such as the Ames Salmonella
test for mutagens. What is most impressive
is that the majority of the references cited
for alternatives are very recent (1975—
1980); thus, this represents a rich source-
book for scientists in many fields. Often the
reason for a scientist using animals for his
studies is that he is simply not aware of
alternative methods that might be more
suitable scientifically, as well as
economically.

There are a few areas presented which
could be debated as to interpretation, but
these are really quite minor, and do not
detract from my overall impression of this
book. It is a well-researched, well-written
and honest account of alternative methods
with which to conduct scientific inquiry.

PERIODICAL PLEASURES by John Gleiber

Since it is unlikely that many readers of
these pages curl up regularly with The
Trapper‘ this seems a good place to bring
up some interesting points that surfaced in
just one article in the February issue. It was
brought to our attention by kind friends.

Parker Dozhier of Bigelow, Arkansas, is
(with good reason, I think) concerned lest
the general public get a clear look at trap-
ping techniques.

“Hunting and trapping are privileges
that have been granted to us by the law-
makers. . . . For this reason trappers, who
are on the razor’s edge in some areas of
losing these privileges, should be con-
stantly aware ofprying eyes.

“The bunnie [sic] hugger out for a Sun-
day morning drive in the woods does not
want to see a fox in a trap at the edge of a
hayfield, even if it’s your hayfield. The
neighbor that drives up in your yard to bor-
row a couple of eggs doesn’t need to see a
carcass pile that would rival Mt. Hood.

“If you feel as if you must trap in some
high visibility areas give that critter enough

chain to hide. That pile of ’possum car-
casses is not going to get any better with
age, deal with them on a day to day basis.
Each and everyone of us are obligated to
all users of wildlife to leave the best impres-
sion we can on the non-users. And the best
way to do that is to make every effort to be
invisible.

“We, as trappers, cannot afford any ex-
posure before the unknowing public. . .
The public simply does not need to be ex-
posed. The lady shopping for a fur coat
does not need a lesson in wildlife manage-
ment, all she needs is a checkbook. By
maintaining as low a profile as possible,
many of our problems of the past, will fade
into the background.

“There is a place for all of the bunny
huggers in this world, they are called con-
sumers and we need them.”

[Emphasis supplied]

The bunny huggers, dear reader, are

you and me.

Greek rest home for old horses

The ancient Greeks are said to have re-
vered animals but this feeling does not
seem to have been inherited by very many
modern Greeks. “I would never want to be
an animal here,” said a Greek TV com-
mentator, showing the charred corpse of a
dog which had been hung from a tree in
an Athens suburb and then burned to
death.

In January Greece joined the European
Economic Community. The EEC, some of
whose original members are not exactly
blameless in matters of animal cruelty, are
putting pressure on Greece to mend its
ways. The government has responded
with a bill which makes cruelty to animals

Another response, this time from a
Greek citizen, comes from Theo Antikat-
zides D.V.M. and member of Animal Wel-
fare Institutes’s International Committee.
In the spring of 1980 a French TV team
filmed the appalling condition of horses
being transported from Greece to France
and Italy for slaughter there as horsemeat.
Dr. Antikatzides has written to AWI to say
that though the film made a great impact
on the Greek public, the Ministry has done
nothing. He has therefore founded the
Hellenic Organization for Retiring Senile
Equines (HORSE). The society has its own
Horse Rest Farm where up to 50 decrepit
horses can be sheltered and paddocked

help can become members of HORSE;

ing Senile Equines, Boyatti-Attica, Greece.

Dog therapist makes TV

Some 10 years back the Information
Report told the story of a mongrel dog
which was about to be used in laboratory
experiments but escaped this gruesome
fate by becoming a canine therapist at the
Children’s Psychiatric Hospital, University
of Michigan. One reader was so entranced
with this story that she delved deeper and
produced a full-length book—Skeezer,

Whales and parrots share CITES spotlight

Whales and parrots were the chief
beneﬁciaries of the 3rd meeting
of the Parties to the Convention
on International Trade in Endan-
gered Species (CITES) in New
Delhi, 25 February-8 March. Of
the now 67 government Parties,
50 attended.

Altogether 350 species of animals
and plants were added—in every case
by overwhelming majorities—to the
lists used by CITES members to pro-
hibit (Appendix I) or monitor (Appen-
dix II) international trade in wildlife
and their products.

By a 37-2 majority the conference
backed a West German proposal to
give sei, fin and sperm whales Appen-
dix I protection. Only the two major
whaling nations, Japan and USSR,
voted against. The US which offered
a much less whole-hearted measure
bringing whale protection into line with
the latest rulings of the International
Whaling Commission abstained on the
vote as did Norway and Paraguay.

Although the impact of the whale
vote was clouded by USSR and Japa-
nese statements that they may enter
reservations on these species, so per-
mitting themselves to continue trade in
sei, fin and sperm whales. the CITES
decision now puts pressure on the
1981 meeting of the [WC to bring its

own quota system into line with the
CITES listings.

US Opposes

In a 32-4 vote all parrots except
budgerigars, cockatiels and Indian
ring-necked parakeets were placed on
one or other Appendix. This means
that of the nearly 200 parrot species
now on these lists 31 are banned from
trade while the remainder can only be
traded with export permits granted by
the country of origin.

he four countries to oppose this

K prOposal were Switzerland, Liech-

tenstein, Chile and—the United States.

Most surprising and difficult to under—
stand is the US vote.

th Shortly before the CITES meeting

9 US shocked the international com-
munity by retracting its own well docu-
mented proposal to list all parrots and

putting forward instead a severely
truncated list of just 25 parrot species.

Neither fiscally conservative politics
nor consumer-nation protection can
justify the new US posture. It was the
conservative UK government—whose
monetary policies have been applaud-
ed by President Reagan—which put
forward the parrot proposal. It was the
consumer nations of the EEC and
Canada which supported the propos-
al, knowing that the new listings would
not for the most part prohibit trade and
hoping that the required monitoring
would make that trade sustainable. As
for the third-world producer nations
most endorsed the parrot listings as an
aid to controlling trade and confound-
ing smugglers.

Those in New Delhi detected the
hand of the pet trade in the drafting of
the ‘revised’ US parrot proposal. It ex-
cluded most of the endangered and
threatened parrots found in legal and
illegal trade currently entering the US
either legally or illegally. Credit (if
that’s the word) for its narrow con-
struction was given to those within the
new administration who want to put
the brakes on environmental and
animal protection. The global commu-
nity would have none of the new US
game of environmental brinkmanship
but what effect will this governmental
peer pressure have on the US delega-
tion now that it has returned home?

There will be strong pressures urg-
ing the US to do what it has never
done before—to take out reservations.
There will be strong pressures urging
implementation. The outcome will
shed some light on the new adminis-
tration’s attitude on global conserva-
tion, and it is an outcome which all
who care about animal protection will
wish to try to influence. The final de-
cision—expected early May—is that of

the horrific facts—have made the world a
slightly safer place for parrots and other

Other decisions

0 The US and Canada jointly proposed
very restrictive criteria for placing on Ap-
pendix II those species not currently
threatened by trade. Various nations ob-
jected strongly that this proposal went flat
against the fundamental principles of the
Convention, undermining its effectiveness
in a number of ways. ObjeCtors included
India, Uruguay, USSR, Australia, Sweden,
Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, West Ger-
many, UK, France.

0 Guidelines for the humane handling
and transport of live species in the CITES
listings were adopted. The Parties also
agreed to try a new voluntary system of
advising each other by post on the condi-
tion of live specimens received in trade.

0 Semi-precious black coral used widely
for jewellery and ornaments will be pro-
tected.

0 The North American gyr falcon pop-
ulation, now increasing, was moved from
Appendix I to II, so allowing trade by per-
mit. All falcons in trade must be banded,
and the US and Canada agreed to review
the situation should evidence arise that en-
dangered European populations are being
smuggled on to the market.

0 A committee will report to the next
meeting of the Parties on the feasibility of
‘reverse listing’ (the listing only of those
species which may be freely traded).

' Confiscated skins, hides and horns of
endangered species will be destroyed
whenever it is not possible to store them
under the strictest security. In particular all
Parties still outside CITES are being urged
to stop trading in rhinoceros horn.

0 The ‘ranching’ of species such as
turtles and crocodiles is permitted under
very strict conditions—including a marking
system to distinguish ranched animals
from wild ones.

0 Parties will investigate the usefulness
of forgery-proof documents and security
stamps to accompany legally traded
wildlife products. Fran Lipscomb

Thousands of primates die
in transit every year

Every year thousands of primates are im-
ported into the US to satisfy the needs of
medical and pseudo~medical research.
And every year thousands die before ever
the men in white coats get hold of them.
This doesn’t mean that the researchers
end up with fewer than they want; it just
means that they order more than they
need knowing that death will claim many
on the way.

The International Primate Protection
League has been studying the records at
the Center for Disease Control Atlanta,
Georgia. Taking only one species, the

mates during 1978 and 1979 involving
high mortality. Deaths during capture and
holding prior to shipment do not, of
course, show up. The drain on wild popu-
lations is thus even greater than the figures
suggest. All species mentioned are on the
endangered or threatened list of CITES.

While the paramount concern is for con-
servation and humane treatment, there is
another worrying aspect of this sorry trade.
Sick animals can endanger the health of all
who handle them, and their use by scien-
tists can invalidate research and contami-
nate the end product.

One of the world’s leading virologists,
Dr. S. Kalter, has severely criticized the
negligence of animal dealers, both export-
ers and importers. He has said: “No in—
depth study is made to ascertain the cause
of death among animals following capture.
They are simply discarded and the holding
station acts as a primary source of infection
for all arriving animals. Likewise very little
is done by importers to determine the
cause of deaths.”

Protecting Whales- Alaska

To protect humpback whales in Glacier
Bay National Monument, Alaska, not more
than 339 small vessels and commercial
fishing vessels may now enter the bay dur-
ing the whale season. Entries by charter
vessels will be at 1976 levels. The commer-
cial harvesting within Glacier Bay of the
humpback’s principal food (capelin, sand-
lance, euphausids, shrimp) is also prohibit-
ed. These new regulations are in force
29 January 1981 through 15 May 1983.

Protecting Whales—
South Africa

As from 5 December 1980 South African
law prohibits the killing or capture of any
whale at any time and the disturbance or
harassment of any whale during the 6-
month breeding season. (Under this law
persons coming within 300 meters of
whales and persons who do not “proceed
immediately” to put at least 300 meters be-
tween themselves and any close-surfacing
whale are guilty of disturbance or harass-
ment.) Since similar regulations already
cover dolphins the new law means that all
cetaceans in South African waters are now
fully protected.

Save the whales —AWl

Richard Ellis, artist and author, has brought
out a new book, The Book of Whales. The
text, lavishly illustrated with the author’s
drawings and paintings, has full descrip-
tions of 33 whale species. Mr. Ellis’s artistry

Four Countries Join International Whaling Commission

Canada Quits

New Directions

at the “NC

Never has so much happened in
such quick succession before an an-
nual meeting of the International
Whaling Commission (IWC). Four
new countries have joined: India,
China, St. Lucia, and Dominica. And
Canada, under intense fire for its vote
against the sperm whale moratorium
at the 1980 IWC meeting, has with—
drawn from the Commission and will
attend only as an observer.

Canada’s former Commissioner,
who cast the swing vote condemning
1320 sperm whales to death, would
have become Chairman of the IWC
this year had Canada remained a
voting member of the Commission.
This important position must be filled
when the Commissioners convene

July 20th in Brighton, England.

Garrett named Acting
U.S. Commissioner

The United States will fight for the
moratorium on commercial whaling,
which it successfully proposed at the
1972 Stockholm Conference on the
Human Environment, under the lead-
ership of a battle—scarred, veteran
whale protector, Tom Garrett, who has
served as Deputy U.S. Commissioner
for three years and now steps into the
position of Acting U.S. Commissioner.
Garrett has worked for whales, resear-
ched and written about them as a pri-
vate citizen and on behalf of Monitor In-

ternational, Defenders of Wildlife, and
Friends of The Earth, attending IWC
meetings for the past ten years as an
NGO (non-govermental organization
observer).

Garrett was proposed as US. Com-
missioner by Secretary of the Interior
James Watt, a former classmate at the
University of Wyoming. Animal wel-
fare, environmental and conservation
groups are solidly behind this signifi-
cant action of the Reagan Administra-
tion despite highly publicized dis-
agreements on a number of other
issues.

Thor Heyerdahl’s plea
for whales

Norway, the world’s third largest
whale killing country, held a “Hvalens
Dag” (Whale Day) program June 15th
at the Sjofarts Museum. It is the first
whaling country to hold a celebra-
tion for whales in their own right.
Leading Norwegians of worldwide

' fame sent messages of encourage-

ment. Liv Ullman cabled at length
from New York, and Thor Heyerdahl’s
telegram was quoted in the Norwegian
press as follows: “Many people hope
and believe as I do that a nature-loving
country and a nature-loving Prime
Minister will show the courage and will
to protect the whales.” Heyerdahl had
reported earlier on the great decrease

New Directions at the IWC
(continued from page 1)

in the number of whales observed by
him on his world famous voyages.

Dagbladet, a leading Norwegian
newspaper, carried a major story by
Hakon Lund headlined with a quota-
tion “Boikott norske varer” (Boycott
Norwegian goods) and illustrated with
photographs of Gregory Peck, Crown
Prince Harald, Thor Heyerdahl, and
Flo, the humpback whale balloon
whose appearance last year in Oslo
had a highly hostile reception from the
police.

The article reported on the Animal
Welfare Institute’s television spots
featuring Peck and Jack Lord, and
referred to what is termed “Norway’s
dilemma”—its vote for a ten-year
moratorium on commercial whaling‘at
the Stockholm Conference on the
Human Environment, and its subse-
quent reversal on that stand. Another
“dilemma” spotlighted by Dagbladet is
Norway’s use of the cold harpoon on
minke whales. Lund refers to the
“death fight” which takes half an hour
because the whalers say use of ex-
plosives in the harpoon spoils too
much meat.

Sir Peter Scott in a long feature
story in Aftenposten, another major
newspaper, emphasized the whales’
great brains, “bigger than ours,” and
their highly developed social system.
Referring to the cold harpoon, he
urged that it “must be possible to pro-
tect the whale against such a cruel
method of killing that we would not
think of using against a cow.”

The marketing director of Nestle-
Findus, whose sales of canned whale
meat have been severely criticized,
told the press that all such sales
stopped this June “in view of the
growing opposition against whale
catching.”

Clearly, Whale Day, organized by
Siri Hall with support from Sonia
Lbchen and other Norwegian humani-
tarians and conservationists, has had a
valuable influence. However, Foreign
Minister Frydenlund told the Nor-
wegian Parliament that a general
moratorium on commercial whaling
must be resisted because catching of
minke whales is “important for many
districts.” An estimated 600 “small
whalers” (fishermen who kill small
whales as opportunity offers) still
operate off the coast of Norway.

French Scientist
Speaks Out
Against Delay

“The only objective and irrefut-
able observation concerning the
evolution of Cetacean stocks in
the past 40 years is that, as the
years have passed, faced with the
accelerated depletion of stocks,
the International Whaling Com-
mission has been forced into
increasing protection of species,
thus providing a proof of failure
in terms of management policy.
Starting from the largest Ceta-
ceans, and finally arriving at the
minke whales, the stocks have all
been more or less maltreated and
are in poor condition. Those that
have been protected are only fin-
ding a precarious balance after a
very long interval. Finally, the
human exploitation of certain re-
sources of the environment that
are indispensable for the survival
of Cetaceans (krill, fish), and the
various pollutions of the marine
environment, do not help to offset
the depletion of the stocks. It
would be perfectly hypocritical to
hide behind the unconditional ac-
ceptance (by deliberately or hap-
lessly ignoring any critical sense)
of pseudo-scientific results (by this
I mean the use of rational high-
level techniques applied to insuffi-
cient and approximate data) to
rule on the future of Cetaceans. In
the absence of a massive influx of
complete and really usable data,
the short-term solution of pro-
viding some hope of preserving
the species resides in the deter-
mination to establish a morator-
ium intended to protect all the
species.”

Something is
Splendid in the
State of Denmark

A very happy note is the follow-up of a
meeting on June 16th at the Danish Em-
bassy with Ambassador Otto Borch and
Counselor S¢ren Dyssegaard and repre-
sentatives from the Animal Welfare In-
stitute, Monitor/USA, Greenpeace/USA
and The Society for Animal Protective
Legislation. As always, the Danes were
courteous, interested and well-informed.
They said they would be in touch with
Copenhagen and would present our posi-
tions urging further whale protection at the
lWC meeting in Brighton.

Counselor Dyssegaard has sent a letter
to John Gleiber of SAPL dated July 7,
1981 and stating in part:

“It is the intention of the Danish
Government to instruct its delegation to
the meeting to support the proposal for
a moratorium on all commercial whal-
ing.

“Finally, it appears likely, from what we
understand, that Denmark will support a
ban against the use of ‘cold harpoons’
in commercial whaling at the annual
meeting.”

Physty makes it!

The first-ever saving of a stranded
Physeter catodon or sperm whale—and a
sick one at that—was quite a media event.
But then sperm whales, sick or well, very
rarely beach themselves. However, in
mid-April on Coney Island, Physty did just
that.

With some difficulty the giant whale was
towed very gently to sick bay—a nearby
boat basin. There pneumonia was diag-
nosed and Physty was force-fed On
penicillin and squid laced with chloro-
mycetin. The recovery curve had its ups
and downs but after a week the patient
was passed fit enough to be asked to leave.
Somewhat reluctantly Physty agreed and
was last seen heading out into the deep
Atlantic.

Here it is a tug of love. But with man it is a tug of war— and the elephant is losing.

HELP SAVE THE
ELEPHANT!

The elephant once roamed all of the
African continent and much of
southern Asia. Today the African ele~
phant’s range has been reduced to
“islands” scattered throughout the
sub-Saharan region, and its numbers
to around 1.3 million, perhaps 15%
of the population just 100 years ago.
The Asian elephant is virtually ex-
tinct in the wild; only a few thousand
of this relict population exist in re-
mote pockets.

The elephant is steadily losing
habitat to the expansion of human
population throughout Africa and
Asia. But the major reason for the
rapid decline in recent years has been
massive poaching for ivory.

Since the early 1970s hundreds of
thousands of elephants have been
shot, poisoned, speared and even
burned by murderous gangs en-
couraged by greedy officials and
unscrupulous traders. In some
African countries army troops have
used machine guns and rocket-
launching helicopters to decimate
whole herds. Large numbers of tiny
tusks, no more than a few inches
long, are appearing on the world
market, testimony to the deaths of
thousands of baby elephants.

Planeloads of the ill-gotten ivory
have been shipped out of Africa to
Europe and the Far East (mainly
France, Belgium, West Germany,

Hong Kong, China and Japan). In one
massacre in Zaire in 1978, corrupt of-
ficials diverted 20 tons of highly toxic
pesticide from coffee plantations and
gave it to gangs who dumped it in
water holes and streams. Thousands
of elephants suffered horrible deaths,
as well as all of the birds, monkeys,
antelopes and other wildlife over a
vast area. So much ivory was loaded
aboard one plane that it almost
crashed on takeoff.

Today the ivory adorns the wrists
and necks of women in the wealthy
nations; major department stores in
the US and Europe feature these
“baubles” in newspaper ads. In the
Far East collectors buy carvings of
ivory. Wealthy investors everywhere
have been stockpiling ivory tasks as
a precious commodity, like gold and
silver. The value of ivory has rocketed
in recent years as speculators
hoarded it, perhaps in anticipation of
the extinction of the species.

You can help save the elephants by
curbing the demand for the ivory that
is causing their destruction. Write a
letter to your local department store
or jewelry store, asking them where
they got their ivory and if they can be
sure that poachers had no hand in it.
Write a letter to your local news-
paper, alerting the public to the
elephant’s plight. If enough people
speak out, we can save the elephants.
Please help.

HARDLY GODLY

American missionaries are apparently the
chief killers of elephants in Sierra Leone,
accounting for 90% of the annual
slaughter. So keen are they on this ‘sport’
that they are even flying their teenage
children over from the States to join them
in the hunt. Sometimes they have hunting
licenses, often they do not. On the
homeward trip their trophies, carved and
raw ivory, go into their personal baggage.

This disturbing information comes from
Geza Teleki of George Washington Uni-
versity who has recently completed a 6-
month tour of Sierra Leone and Senegal.
Mr. Teleki also gives news of those two
notorious animal dealers residing in Sierra
Leone, Franz Sitter and Suleiman Man-
saray. Prohibited by presidential decree
from trafficking any longer in chimpan-
zees—though not before decimating West
Africa’s chimp populations—they have
switched their attentions to other animals.
Franz Sitter in particular is making big
money on the export of all varieties of live
animals as well as skins, tusks and hides.

Mr Teleki reports that in Senegal ivory
traders do a brisk business without bother-
ing to acquire official documents authenti-
cating the source of the ivory and licensing
its sale. Apparently much of the ivory
reaching Dakar is smuggled from Sierra
Leone across Guinea.

In Sierra Leone, however, the situation
could be on the mend. The Cabinet has
approved a national conservation strategy.
In 1982 hunting restrictions will be im-
posed on a long list of rare species and all
wildlife exports will be banned in order to
protect the areas that are scheduled to be-
come reserves. Chief among these is the
proposed Outamba-Kilimi National Park.
This 980km2 tract of almost untouched sa-
vanna forest contains numerous endan-
gered animals, including leopard, elephant,
chimpanzee, colobus monkey and croco-
dile. A small 30 km2 swamp, rich in reptile
and bird life, has already been established
as the Mamunta-Mayoso Game Reserve.

What do pigs
want? Ask
them!

“If you want to know what a pig wants,
ask a pig” runs the headline of a long
article in the March 13 issue of the
British journal, Farmers Weekly. The
article describes the work of the Agri-
cultural Research Council’s Institute of
Animal Physiology at Cambridge.

The Institute has devised experi-
ments (based on the techniques of
operant conditioning) to get pigs to
“state” their preferences. For instance,
do pigs prefer light to darkness and, if
so, all the time or just some of the
time? Bearing in mind that wild pigs
are nocturnal animals, the slightly sur-
prising answer is that pigs kept alone
like to have the light on 72% of the
time. Whether pigs in groups are
equally “switched on” to light is now
being studied.

What is the point of all this?
Research worker Dr. Douglas Ingram
says: “We know that hormonal activity
affects growth rate and general per-
formance, so there may be some op-
portunity to influence the pig’s com-
mercial performance if we can deter-
mine preferences.”

From this it is clear that the In-
stitute holds to the view that
animal welfare and sound man-
agement are one and the same
thing. Dr. Bob Baldwin puts it this
way: “Our experiments are designed
to allow pigs to tell us what they want.
There are obvious links between social
rank, aggression and outbreaks of ear
and tail biting. The more we can learn
about the pig’s basic behavior, the
greater will be our chances of avoiding
sporadic outbreaks of bullying and

cannibalism under intensive condi-
ﬁons”

Dinner’s late—never mind

Pigs are remarkably adaptable.
When “dinner time” was shifted from
2:30 pm. to 9:30 p.m.—a 7-hour dif-
ference—they very quickly adjusted.
By the second day they were happily
sleeping through to the later hour.

This adaptability may make life
easier for the stockman —and pigs cer-
tainly do thrive in very different sys-
tems—but this is not to say that they

4

 

will learn to love all environments
equally. Far from it.

Pigs are intelligent and inquisitive.
Boredom could be one reason for
poor (unprofitable) performance. Per-
haps they should be encouraged to
“work” for their food, water and even
light. Perhaps, too, their environment
should be more varied and stimulating
than it normally is in commercial units.
Says Dr. Elizabeth Walser: “Pigs are
extremely interested in any loose fit-
tings in the pen and will continually ex-
plore and play with them. There is cer-
tainly no harm in deliberately adding
simple and inexpensive loose compo-
nents like chains, to try to create added
interest.” Providing logs and small
pieces of timber enables pigs to engage
in their natural rooting and shovelling
behavior. Pigs also like to eat straw
and use it as bedding and nesting
material.

Meanwhile in Edinburgh . . .

Parallel research is going on at the
Edinburgh School of Agriculture. Pig
behavior there is being studied at its
roots. Stage one of the project began
when six groups of adult pigs were
turned loose to breed freely. Their out-
door home is a rich environment. A
steep sloping site, it includes pine
woodland, gorse bushes, springs, two
streams and boggy marshland with
rushes at the bottom of the hill.

Nearly all nests are sheltered on at
least one side (the wind in Edinburgh
can be bitingly cold) and often have an
open view facing south. Fully en-
closed nests are rare. A view

Practical application of this work will

mation Report.

 

Dr. Grzimek on
factory farming

The distinguished scientist and au-
thor, Dr. Bernhard Grzimek, has given
his permission to reprint the following
translated excerpt from his book From
Grizzly Bear to Cobra recently pub-
lished in West Germany.

As food consumers, we are collaborators
in the torture of animals. Few of us are
aware of how much suffering is involved in
the production of eggs and veal and pork.

Calves live in complete darkness in cells
so narrow they cannot turn around. Their
only nourishment is a milklike fluid. When
thirsty they lick urine from the walls and
floor. Because of their diet, designed to
make them anemic, these calves have diffi-
culty breathing and their swollen legs will
hardly support them. Because of their die-
tary deficiency, they crave iron and will
also lick anything made of iron that they
can reach.

Pigs—similar to dogs on the biological
scale—are squeezed between iron bars
and forced to lie, without bedding, on iron
gratings. They are also kept in the dark, in
this case to prevent tail biting, with no
chance for any normal activity.

Three of every four eggs are produced
by horribly tortured hens. They are
crowded into wire cages stacked one
above the other. These cages are so
cramped that birds are crowded beneath
and atop other birds. The wide-spaced wir—
ing of the cage floors means the hens can
never stand naturally. The bottoms of the
cages (sloped so that the eggs roll forward)
increases their discomfort. Muscles and
tendons are strained, joints ache. Such
“battery hens” can never rest on a com-
fortable perch, stretch their wings, or even,
take a dust bath. The mucous membrane
of the cloaca protudes after an egg is laid,
and the other birds will often peck at this
sensitive area. Crowded, bored and frus-
trated hens fight, pull out each others
feathers, and sometimes kill and cannl-
balize each other. To help prevent this,
beaks are notched with a hot knife which
makes pecking, even for food, extremely
painful. Such birds are constantly plagued
by mites because they cannot use the“
damaged beaks to groom themselves.

Magical
encounter
with a
humpback

For several days while snorkelling in
Hawaii I had been “calling” the hump-
back call. Though the whales seemed
to ignore me I persisted. And then one
day it happened. As I swam I noticed a
humpback coming closer. I gave my
call. The whale began circling me.
When she was between me and the
shore she gave a wonderful perform-
ance of ballet in slow motion. First her
body broke surface, then the enor-
mous fluke was lifted high and held,
coming down only slowly. She was
about 50 yards away and beckoning
me. It was hard to follow her move-
ment below the surface as the water
was cloudy.

Suddenly I heard her very near. I
heard her breathing. Like a huge valve
puffing in slow rhythm. Then I saw the
top of her body about 20 feet from me.
I hesitated—then swam towards her.
She had been motionless but now she
dived, very gently. I stopped swim-
ming and floated, turning in her direc—
tion.

And then —there they were! Not one
whale but three! Snuggled against a
huge mother humpback, greyish black
with bright barnacles sprinkled over
her body, was a sleek black baby not
much larger than myself—and behind
them came “auntie,” less than a third
the size of mother.

I was at the mother’s head, my eyes
looking into her eye. I was hypnotized
and gazed incredulously, being sure at
this point that I had nothing to fear.
The tableau was motionless, calm and
beautiful.

The slight movement of the ocean
drifted me shoreward and the mother
whale followed by bending her body
towards me. As she did this the baby
drifted at right angles to her and while I
was pushing slowly away the baby’s

fluke almost hit my head. I became a .

little anxious. Did the mother really
want me this close to her new-born
baby?

She turned on her side. I was now
right alongside the huge fluke. With

one motion she could wallop me into
extinction. But she didn’t. I decided to
drift closer to the “auntie” and made a
few strokes in that direction. Then
something awful happened.

There was a sudden extemely loud
noise overhead. Startled I looked up.
A small helicopter was directly over us.
When I looked down again just sec-
onds later the whales were gone.

Postscript. Two days later while
swimming round the reef I again sang
the whale song. Almost immediately it
was answered. I thought it was a snor-
keller imitating me. But no. As I swam
beyond the reef it was clear the answer
came from far out—rhythmically at
one second intervals in unison with my
own call.

I altered my call. No reply. I reverted
to my first call and back came the
answer again. I was hoping the whale
would approach as before. But this
time it did not happen.

If only certain areas of these waters
could be off-limits to speed boats.
Then whales I believe would be more
willing to come inshore. Fast-driven
speed boats also scare away the reef
fish —and can be dangerous to sub-
merged snorkellers.

A small plant can
help save
Leviathan

A plant that produces a liquid wax with
properties unique to the plant kingdom. A
plant that provides, in the words of the
Australian government’s Inquiry into
Whales and Whaling, “a suitable substitute
for sperm-whale oil in almost all applica-
tions.” A plant that thrives in near-rainless
desert where other plants would wither
and die. The name of this miracle plant?
Jojoba—Simmondsia chinensis.

Demand for the precious oil—unlike
sperm oil it is so pure it needs virtually no
refining—is growing apace and more and
more desert countries are becoming pro-
ducers. The world’s largest jojoba project is
in Costa Rica. There the government-
owned company Rancho San Rafael SA is
busy tran’sforming several thousand acres
of arid desert into a flourishing and highly
lucrative plantation. The jojoba’s roots go
deep to tap the ground water 30 feet
down, and once the bushes have reached

maturity (3-5 years) every acre is expected
to yield an annual profit of $12,000.

Another country interested in jojoba is
Argentina. AWI has heard from Luis Car—
pineti who works for the country’s Forest
Institute Research Department (IFONA).
He says jojoba is being experimentally
cultivated in various parts of Argentina. He
points out some of its incidental virtues. It
grows happily in salty soil, makes appetiz-
ing forage for wildlife and livestock, and “is
ideal for those who like green salads—and
is also good for people who have high
blood presure.”

All this from just one little nut tree!

Jojoba is among dozens of former
Indian crops that today lie unloved
and untended within US borders. . . .
Indians, who have long roasted jojoba
beans for “coffee” and used the oil as
hairdressing, have spearheaded a
drive to bring the crop into modern
agriculture. . . . Indian reservations in
the Southwest harbor some of the
worst pockets of poverty in the nation.
The land is useless for conventional
crops, often two-thirds of the work
force is unemployed. In five or ten
years jojoba could bring self-suffi-
ciency to reservations that have de-
pended on federal services for a cen-
tury. . . . So great is demand that in
1980 the San Carlos Apaches in Cali-
fornia received as much as $3300 for
a barrel of jojoba oil the yield of a
single well-tended quarter acre.

A Hawaiian bird sues . . . and 12 grizzlies follow suit

The tiny and very rare palila is a member
of the honeycreeper family. It lives only on
the upper slopes of Hawaii’s dormant
volcano, Mauna Kea, and feeds only on
the seeds of the flowery mamane tree. Lit-
tle by little sheep and goats, first intro-
duced to Hawaii about 200 years ago by
European explorers, have eaten away its
habitat and food source, so much so that in
1975 it went on the Endangered Species
list.

In 1978, with a little help from its friends
in mainland America, the palila sued the
state of Hawaii—the first lawsuit ever
brought in the name of a species. The bird
won. The state, bleating loudly, appealed.
The bird won again.

Periodical pleasures byaohneieibe,

Probably the most concise environmental
publication with an overview of just what is
going on throughout the world is Oryx, the
official magazine of the Fauna and Flora
Preservation Society (address: Zoological
Society, Regent’s Park, London NW1,
England). Membership rates for the United
States range from $10 for Students to $20
for Ordinary Members to $40 for Benefac-
tors. Life memberships are $600 for those
aged 60 or under and $300 for those over.
That should remind you we are all mortal.

Subjects in a recent issue include
whales, condors, Brazilian sideneck turtles
and lechwe (highly specialized antelopes).
It’s small enough to slip into a pocket or a
handbag and scholarly-looking enough to
make it a surprise to find Oryx T-shirts
advertised—between the special currency
arrangements for Zambian members and
announcement of the 1981 tour to Peru.

The writing and reporting is of a uni-
formly high calibre. There are interesting
photographs, maps and charts for the seri-
ous reader and a “Briefly” column giving
information in capsule form which is both
instructive and entertaining. Where else
could you find out that the elk population
in Estonia is up?

A typically alert member of our staff (not,
alas, me) recently read through Associa-
tion Trends which is published at 7204
Clarendon Road, Washington DC 20014
for “America’s top 25,000 association ex—
ecutives.” Page 2 of the 10 April issue
reports a speech made by Mike Gretschel,
President of National Outdoor Sports Ad-
vertising, Inc. It’s an interesting account of
the campaign the National Rifle Associa-
tion approved and which, according to the
magazine, “skyrocketed” enrollment.

Gretschel proudly announced that
“using direct mail, TV, telephone and
space ads, the project has succeeded
through a widespread distrust of bureau-

6

crats and fear of legislators. . . .” Besides
this emotional impetus, the NRA member-
development program includes a sports-
man/ hunter offer. Gretschel said that more
than 50% of the success of a mailing is
determined by the way the offer is formu-
lated, and in this case he included liability,
theft and gun-loss insurance. “Emotional
appeal is added with a description of
NRA’s foes.”

It makes one proud to not be a member
of the National Rifle Association.

One of the most genuinely charming
magazines I have encountered in a long
time is Swara, the magazine of the East
African Wildlife Society which incor—
porates “Panda News from World Wildlife
Fund/Kenya.” Swara means antelope in
Swahili, but I bet you know that.

While not a “glossy” magazine, the color
photographs are lovely and the articles
have a pleasing blend of information and
lore with an almost familial kind of
folksiness. A recent issue celebrated the
first birthday of Juma, an artificially reared
baby elephant at the Nairobi National Park
Orphanage, told about genets which, it
turns out, are more mongoose than cat,
and had a smashing piece about endlessly
romantic Kilimanjaro.

Anyone who leafs through this and does
not have an almost irresistible urge to head
for the nearest international airport has
either a heart of stone or an exceptionally
clearsighted view of the state of his bank
account.

The East African Wildlife Society was
founded to “safeguard wildlife and its
habitat in all its forms as a national and
international resource.” Ordinary US
membership is $18 with airmail service for
the magazine an additional cost. Write to
the Society at PO Box 20110, Nairobi,
Kenya. Other than cash, you may use
American Express or Diners Club.

Spurred on by the famous victory of the
tiny 6—ounce bird, 12 heavyweight grizzly
bears from Wyoming (in company with the
Sierra Club and Defenders of Wildlife)
have sued the federal government. They
allege that the granting of mineral explora-
tion rights in an area which they inhabit
violates the National Environmental Policy
Act and the Endangered Species Act.
They claim that the Forest Service and the
Fish and wildlife Service have failed to give
due weight to their biological needs.

 

Animal testing—
alternatives funded

Four separately funded research programs
have been established with the goal of
finding a non-animal alternative to the
Draize eye-irritation test. This test uses
large numbers of rabbits to determine the
safety of cosmetics, detergents and many
household products. The chemical to be
tested is placed in one eye of a series of
living rabbits and the effects are noted.

Dr William Douglas of the Tufts Univer-
sity Medical School has been awarded a
grant of $100,000 by the New England
Anti-Vivisection Society to develop an al-
ternative to the Draize test. He will study
the toxicity of chemicals on cells cultivated
from human corneal tissue.

A three-year grant totalling $176,000
was awarded July 9 to Joseph Leighton,
MD. of the Medical College of Pennsyl-
vania’s Department of Pathology, to de-
velop a non-animal substitute for the
Draize test. Dr. Leighton will study inflam-
mation caused by different substances on
the chorioallantoic membrane of the chick
embryo. The work is expected to comple-
ment the study at Tufts University. The
American Fund for Alternatives to Animal
Research is the lead organization making
the grant, assisted with substantial contri-
butions for each of the three years from
the Air Chief Marshall the Lord Dowding
Fund for Humane Research and the

Revlon Inc. is providing a $750,000 3-
year grant to The Rockefeller University.
According to Dr. Dennis Stark, Associate
Professor and Director of Rockefeller’s
Laboratory Animal Research Center, initial
research will use tissue culture.

Avon, through the Cosmetic, Toiletry
and Fragrance Association, has committed
$250,000 towards the creation of a na-
tional center for the study of alternatives
and has set aside a further $500,000 for
special research projects. Funding for the
national center will also come from other
cosmetic companies and possibly from
other industries. Some 20 research institu-
tions have been invited to submit research
proposals. One of these institutions will be
selected as the national center.




Salmon fishery nets porpoises
and seabirds in thousands

Thousands of Dall porpoises and hundreds of thousands of seabirds are
killed each year by Japanese salmon gillnets in the North Pacific and
Bering Sea. Yet on 10 June the US granted Japan’s salmon fishery a fur-
ther 3-year permit, so allowing this massive destruction of marine life

to continue. Why?

US spokesmen contend that to have refused the permit would simply
have meant the Japanese fishery setting its nets outside the US zone.
This would not stop the “incidental take.” Indeed the government
thinks that such a move would probably result in higher mortality for
both Dall porpoises and seals and disrupt the migration of salmon to
Alaska. Seabirds, though, are a different matter.

Recent studies (David Ainley et al)
show that since its inception in 1952
the salmon fishery has accounted for
some 10 million seabirds—almost
twice the original estimate—and that
some populations of diving birds are in
trouble. Petrels, fulmars and albatross
are very liable to become entangled as
they attempt to seize the netted fish.

Bird mortality is governed by two
main factors. One: mesh size of net. If
the mesh is small, under 82 mm, very
few birds are trapped. Two: distance
from breeding grounds. Within 50—75
nautical miles of their nesting sites,
seabirds, particularly murres and puf—
fins, are more densely concentrated,
so more likely to be caught. (The
salmon gillnet fishery off Greenland
kills BSD—500,000 thick-billed murres a
year, 88% of them within 30 nautical
miles of the coast.)

Lethal necklace

Massive monofilament webbed drift
nets used by the Japanese salmon
fishery are illegal for US fishermen.
The Russians don’t use them either. It
is a wasteful way to catch salmon. Set
like curtains across 10 miles and more
Of sea, these nets catch anything too
large to swim through the mesh.
Monofilament netting is indestructible;
it does not rot. An entangled dolphin
of seal may break free but still be
adorned by an irremovable and (final-
1y) lethal “necklace” of net.

The 3-year permit to the Japanese
salmon fishery to take 5500 Dall por-
poises a year with exemption from the
Incidental take requirement of the
Marine Mammal Protection Act was
Issued under the following conditions:

1) A greater Japanese-US research
effort, with the emphasis on designing

nets and gear that will not be so waste—
ful. An annual report on this research
is required.

2) No incidental take of harbor por-
poises, white-sided dolphins or killer
whales is allowed.

3) The industry must pay for an un-
specified number of observers on their
vessels who will monitor compliance
with the permit requirements. The
seabird problem has not been dealt
with directly. Neither the Department
of Interior, which administers the Mi-
gratory Bird Treaty, nor the Depart-
ment of Commerce, which oversees
marine mammal conflicts with the
salmon fishery, would claim jurisdic-
tion. The permit granted by Com-
merce, however, urges the fishery to
cooperate with the US and Japanese
governments in developing methods
to reduce seabird mortality. Com-
merce will help develop an appro-
priate research program and will in-
struct observers to count and identify
injured and dead birds caught in the
nets. But where the money for a full
study will come from remains unclear.

 

Drinking water stays

Livestock awaiting slaughter will continue
to have access to drinking water. The
Department of Agriculture has rejected the
petitions of the American Association of
Meat Processors and the Iowa Beef Proc-
essors, Inc. The former claimed there were
difficulties in supplying water in the final
holding pens and that since animals do not
readily drink in strange surroundings they
were not being mistreated if denied water
in their last 24 hours of life. The regulations
were promulgated under the 1978
humane slaughter amendments to the
Federal Meat Inspection Act.

Why are common
songbirds not so common
any more?

Scarlet tanager, western tanager, black-
and-white warbler, rose-breasted gros-
beak—common songbirds of the United
States. But common for how much longer?
And are they really US birds? The two
questions are linked. For these migrants
spend upwards of half their lives in the
nee-tropical forests ,of Latin America. And
these forests are fast being felled by multi-
national timber companies and are being
converted into marginal cropland and
shortlived cattle pasture. (Our liking for
hamburgers is swallowing up huge tracts of
these forests. McDonald’s sells 3 billion
hamburgers yearly, using 300,000 head of
cattle).

Destroy habitat and you destroy not
only the wildlife that lives there now but all
the unborn generations to come. Of all
threats to wildlife, habitat destruction is the
greatest. And no habitat is under greater
threat than the forests that are the winter
home of some of “our” best-loved
songbirds.

The theory that this winter home con-
sists only of second-growth forest, with the
mature forest left to the all-the-year-round
inhabitants, has been disproved. Studies
show that the migrants freely mingle with
the stay-at-homes in the mature forest—
what’s left of it. Since 1968—according to
the Fish and Wildlife Service annual sur-
vey conducted in 1700 US sites—fewer
and fewer migratory songbirds have been
making the spring trip north each year.

Factory Farming
(continued from page 4)

In Germany, alone, 6,000,000 hens are
housed like this. Because of this over-
crowding they are very susceptible to
disease. High egg-yield is no indication of
health or well-being. Most battery hens
have degenerated livers. Their droppings
have a high water content indicating that
many trace elements and water-soluble
vitamins are lost. The pale yellow yolks are
artifically colored to make them more ap-
pealing. 15 shades of yellow are currently
available. It is worth noting that owners
and employees of such poultry “factories”
usually get their own eggs from free range
hens.

Factory farmers seem only to consider
high yields and low labor costs. It is
cheaper to allow a certain percentage of
the animals to die rather than pay for ade-
quate caretaking. Thousands of calves
once suffocated when artifical ventilation
failed during the night. Near Plattling,
100,000 chickens died within an hour
when the air conditioning broke down.

Animals have in theory won certain
rights. According to a new law anyone
who does not provide suitable housing or
limits the movements of animals, so as to
cause pain, suffering or injury, can be
prosecuted. This law is administered by the
Minister of Agriculture. Although only a
scientist specializing in animal behavior is
qualified to determine the housing needs
of each species, the Minister of Agriculture
appointed a committee of “experts,” most-
ly poultry producers or representatives of
the poultry industry.

A Dusseldorf court dismissed a com-
plaint against this author claiming that he
had called chickens kept in batteries
“concentration camp hens.” He did not in-
vent this expression. It had been approved
by Martin Niemoller and Dr. Wankel,
former concentration camp prisoners
themselves. Two Nobel Prize laureates,
Professors Konrad Lorenz and Karl von
Frisch have publicly stated that keeping
hens in batteries constitutes extreme cruel-
ty.

Under pressure from the industry, as
well as from countless humanitarians, the
Minister of Agriculture responded by allot-
ting 1,500,000 marks (about $700,000) of
taxpayers’ money for a study to determine
whether keeping hens in batteries was not,
in fact, inhumane in spite of the fact that
many exhaustive studies are already in ex-
istence. This meant a 5-year delay was
won for the factory farmers of the poultry
industry.

Many dairy cows never see sunlight or
grass from their birth to their death. The
goal of ever higher milk and meat produc-
tion quotas requires an ever increased dai-
ly intake of high protein feed which con-
tains many insecticides. While some are

8

excreted by the animals, others, like DDT,
remain in the milk. Antibiotics and the hor-
mones that are mixed with feeds for a
quicker weight-gain leave residues which
are then ingested by the human consumer.
The widespread use of penicillin and
related antibiotics gives rise to resistant
strains of bacteria. These various drugs can
also cause allergic reactions and hormonal
imbalances so that they are not effective
when really needed.

The government is trying to restrict the
use of these dangerous substances by
changing the law. It is doubtful that they
can succeed. Over 50,000,000 marks a
year changes hands in the black market.
There are not enough trained inspectors to
test the constantly increasing number of
toxic agents and other additives in our
foodstuffs, and, even more seriously, in
animal feeds. When investigators studied
carcasses of 521 pigs and 137 calves that
had passed inspection, dangerous sub-
stances were found in 141/296 of the pigs
and in 821/2% of the calves.

Minister of Agriculture Josef Ertl has
written that where there are large num-
bers of animals, medication cannot be
given on an individual basis and that, when
the outbreak of a disease is feared, drugs
must be administered simultaneously to
every animal. Since disease is a constant
threat, Dr. Ertl recommends that antibiotics
be used regularly as a food supplement.

Small amounts of pesticides are retained
in the human body, particularly in the liver.
Even when liver damage is not evident, its
defenses against pathogenic agents may
be weakened. This may be the reason for
the prevalence of hepatitus and other in-
fectious diseases.

Animal husbandry is being taken over
by large business firms. Since farming
began, it has always worked hand in hand
with nature. Manure was spread on the
fields where it was broken down by soil
bacteria and changed into humus. The
enormous amount of manure produced by
factory farms cannot be handled this way.
Liquid manure is polluting brooks, rivers
and lakes which are already polluted.
Sometimes, it is spread on the ground or
placed in underground containers. Sal-
monella, which causes so much intestinal
damage in man and animals, can easily
live in liquid manure for over a year. When
manure gets into rivers and lakes, it pro-
motes a heavy growth of algae which
decomposes and kills fish and other forms
of life.

Agriculture is necessary for our sur-
vival—it should be supported by revenues
from industry. We cannot return to the
horse and the plow. Without a fuel supply,
fields would lie fallow. But those responsi-
ble for our agrarian policy should not arti-
ficially industrialize our agriculture—to
the detriment of the farmer and our
environment.

    

This is no Sport

Organized dogfighting with heavy
gambling on the outcome is alive and well
in the United States despite the federal law
passed in 1976 to prevent dogfighting on
an interstate basis. Congressional appro-
priations committees have starved it of en-
forcement funding. Full—blooded dogfights
to the death involve some 10,000 people
nationwide—and about 25% of them live
in Georgia according to the Humane So-
ciety of the United States.

According to Gene Tharpe, writing in
The Atlanta Constitution on March 30,
1981, 100 men, women and even small
children were gathered in a Richmond
County (Georgia) barn to enjoy a san-
guinary evening of dog fights. The police
arrived, arrested 18 people and seized
nearly $40,000 in cash, 50 pistols, seven
cases of untaxed liquor and quantities of
marijuana, cocaine and pills.

In Georgia, dogfighting, though illegal, is
merely a misdemeanor carrying only a
light penalty. The state’s General Assem-
bly is considering a bill that would make
the offense a felony, a greatly needed
strengthening of the law.

This barbarous “sport” is prevalent in
the Southeast, Southwest, Great Lakes re-
gion and California.

Recently, in California, where ac-
cording to Statute 597.5 it is a felony
to “. . . own, possess, keep or train a
dog with the intent that the dog shall
be engaged in an exhibition of fight-
ing with another dog,” eleven people
were arrested due to quick action by
U.S. Customs Inspectors Jay 0. Erd-
man and John J. Morley. They spot-
ted a mangled pit bull dog in a car
coming across the Mexican border
and notified San Diego Police Officer
Fred Hill who placed the driver under
arrest. Additional officers were then
stationed at the border and they ar-
rested others coming in with injured
dogs. The dogs were seized and taken
to the Mission Valley Emergency
Animal Clinic. Officer Hill said: “The
condition of the dogs was almost
beyond description. Some had their
ears chewed off and others were
bleeding profusely from deep gauges
and bites on their legs and other
parts of their bodies.” County Animal
Control Officer Steve Crane said
“Some of the dogs were so badly
chewed up a veterinarian couldn’t
even find veins to administer medica-
tion.”

Because of this strong law and effi-
cient enforcement, by the end of May
seven verdicts had been handed
down. The penalties included fines
ranging from $1000 to $3000 and
sentences of 10 to 30 days in jail.

    

 




 

The Sting

(continued from page 1)
while awaiting shipment to
Japan.

STING THREE—APRIL. Still
more sea otter pelts, with a black
market value of up to $2500 each,
are seized by agents of the US
Fish and Wildlife Service posing
as buyers. Two men are arrested.
They claim they could deliver
26,000 otter pelts.

Congratulations to the Fish and
Wildlife Service for three fine “sting”
operations! But unhappily the sting
in this tale does not stop there. The
federal agents were able to act as
they did because sea mammals are
protected by the 1972 Marine Mam-
mal Protection Act. Now the Act it-
self stands in urgent need of protec-
tion.

There is big money to be made
from marine mammals—witness the
above cases. But the mammals also
have other powerful enemies. Many
oil and fishing interests view them as
unwelcome intruders—and their pro-
tection as costly and tiresome.

This year the Marine Mammal Pro-
tection Act comes up for reauthoriza-
tion. Certain interests are demanding
that Congress make major changes.
Some even question if the Act is
“really necessary.”

Action to date

On 6 May the US Senate Com-
merce Committee voted to reauthor-
ize the MMPA for two years, stipulat-
ing that the parties most concerned
must make “substantial progress”
toward resolving their differences by
31 July. Any resulting amendments
will be voted on by the full Senate in
the fall.

On 13 May the House Merchant
Marine and Fisheries Committee nar-
fOle amended the 2-year reauthor-
ization, reducing it to just one year.

Under the present Act it is the
federal government which controls
the fate of marine mammals. States
can assume management only if they
extend the same protection as does
the federal government. Alaskan rep-
resentatives have said they want to
manage their own marine mammals
and want the shift to be made with-
out formal hearings which allow
croSS-examination of witnesses.

More than one year essential

Assessment as to what is a healthy
Population for the various marine
mammal species has been a job for

 

scientists who study the creatures
with other co-habitants in their envi-
ronment. Only in recent years have
some of these populations started to
reach this healthy level, a range
known as Optimum Sustainable
Papulation (OSP).

To provide a stable atmosphere for
the proper enforcement of the Act,
reauthorization for more than one
year is essential. Also a l-year reau-
thorization will mean the Marine
Mammal Protection Act and the En-
dangered Species Act come up
simultaneously for consideration by
Congress in a year’s time. The overlap
would more easily allow enemies of
the MMPA to eliminate it in the guise
of merging it with the Endangered
Species Act. There would then be
no protection for the hundreds of
thousands of seals and dolphins and
other marine mammals which are not
strictly endangered or threatened.

The Marine Mammal Protection
Act protects all marine mammals,
not just those facing extinction. lts
enactment and implementation has
been cited as an example of model
legislation for sound marine conser-
vation. It should not be mauled or
murdered or merged to appease the
selfish and short-sighted demands of
a vocal minority.

 

Lead shot kills birds
without hitting them

Last winter Lake Puckaway, Wisconsin,
provided macabre and massive evidence
that lead shot can kill without ever hitting
its target. Freak weather and food condi-
tions combined to induce several thousand

And when these geese nestlings grow up
will they live—or die of lead poisoning?

Canada geese to winter at the lake instead
of flying further south.

The lake’s shallow bottom is strewn with
lead pellets fired by hunters. The wintering
geese swallowed quantities of these pellets
while feeding and at least 3000 of them
died from lead poisoning—as was proved
when gizzards were cut open and the
pellets revealed.

Tragically Governor Dreyfus of Wiscon-
sin had signed a bill early in 1980 lifting the
state’s prohibition against lead shot, argu-
ing that the ban was unjustified. The argu-
ment, always flimsy, has now been shot to
ribbons. Wisconsin should promptly reim-
pose the ban on lead pellets and allow only
steel or, better still, the new non-toxic
“soft-iron” shot.

Flesh-eating birds at the top of the food
chain are also at risk. Dr Milton Friend,
Director of the National Wildlife Health
Laboratory at Madison, Wisconsin, says:
“I’m disturbed at how often we find lead
poisoning in bald eagles.” A carcass analy-
sis by the Fish and Wildlife Service showed
more eagles dying from lead poisoning
than from pesticide poisoning.

Over in England the problem is not
hunters but fishermen. Post-mortems on
swans from the Thames, Tees, Avon and
other rivers, revealed that more than half
of them had succumbed to lead poisoning
after swallowing lead fishing weights. The
rest had up to three times the normal
amount of lead in their blood—victims of
the estimated 250 tons of lead annually
dumped by anglers in Britain’s waterways.
(The comparable figure for spent lead shot
in the US is 3000 tons.)

 

Disturbing effects of
vehicles on desert soils

Recreation, housing and the needs of
defense are putting increasing strain on
arid landscapes in the southwestern states.
In 1979, the Council on Environmental
Quality reported that 25% of Americans
take part in “ORV recreation.” On arid
soils especially this can do great and lasting
damage. The 22 May issue of Science
(page 915) reports on field experiments in
the western Mojave Desert, California, to
assess and predict the effect of “off-road
vehicles” on arid soils.

A prime concern is the rate at which
compacted soil recovers. lnvading vegeta-
tion may appear within a few years but ex-
trapolation of data in a long-abandoned
townsite in Nevada suggests that native
perennials may need a century or more.
The funereal pace at which damaged
desert soils regain their former healthy
structure means that erosion persists long
after the destructive deed has been done.
Desertification is not an affliction confined
by the laws of nature to the Third World.

 




 

CITES product
ban stays

Good News! The US. will honor the
new CITES listings in their entirety. There
will be no US. “reservations” on parrots or
any other species.

The equivocal line, especially on parrots,
taken by the American delegation at the
CITES (Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora) meeting of the Parties
last March in India had aroused fears that
the US. might duck its international obliga-
tions and, alone among member countries,
permit unmonitored trade in threatened
parrot species to continue. It has not hap-
pened.

The three-month grace period in which
parties are entitled to omit from their own
national list species newly added to the
CITES lists has now passed. The US.
100% “no reservation” remains intact.
Good!

 

Pet birth control
clinic pays off

In August 1976 the Vancouver branch of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals opened a Spay and Neuter
Clinic. Its effect has been most marked. In
1976 over 80,000 cats and dogs in the
Vancouver area were destroyed as being
“surplus to human requirement.” By 1980
the figure had dropped to 17,800. In the
same period the number of dead animals
picked up off the streets declined by
90% —from 310 to 31.

Another bonus is that attacks by dogs on
livestock are now rare—and reimburse-
ments to farmers for animals lost corre-
spondingly low. In one municipality (Delta)
farmers received nearly $6000 in 1976. In
1980 the sum was just $34—the value of
six chickens.

 

“

. . . roos have tremendous

vitality and die very hard.”

For seven years the US. government
gave protection to kangaroos by banning
imports of hides and meat. But on 29 May
the US. Interior Department lifted the ban.
Shortly before the official action, Judge
Aubrey Robinson ruled in District Court
that Interior’s action was legal. Defenders
of Wildlife, which had brought the test
case, appealed 3 June for summary rever-
sal by the Court of Appeals. No action has
yet been taken by the court. The pending
case deals with the question of whether
commercial trade can be authorized in
species listed as Threatened under the
Endangered Species Act. The Red Kanga-
roo and both the Eastern and Western
Grey Kangaroo, chief targets of the com-
mercial skin and meat trade, remain on In-
terior’s Threatened Species list. But quite
apart from this question, important as it is,
the extreme cruelty routinely employed in
the commercial killing of kangaroos cannot
be tolerated by US. consumers. Docu-
mented repeatedly over the past ten years
is the appalling fact that it is common prac-
tice to shoot to cripple, not to kill. The
accompanying diagram shows the location
of the “pelvic shot,” “hip shot,” and
“kidney shot.” Advice from The Roo
Shooter, by Keith Weatherly (1968, Pacific
Book) includes “When you shoot a roo for
skin with a heavy rifle, it’s no good to blow
out half its chest. You shoot for the pelvis,
even from the front . . . the tiny copper-
jacketed bullet would have to break the
pelvis or the spine . . . the classical pelvis
shot . . . six inches above the tail, two
inches off the center line of the back.”
Another comment from The Roo Shooter:
“ . . . roos have tremendous vitality and die
very hard.”

The human-like cries and sobs of
wounded kangaroos are frequently de-
scribed: an article in Audubon magazine
March 1974, by Franklin Russell states:
“When we raced up to him he was dying.

IS”! 60 R00 g/IDOZZ&.

/

His whimpering child-like cries, coupled
with those two front paws reaching out
blindly, intertwining, rubbing each other in
what appeared to be anguish, evoked the
despair of unexpected death. Big Red died
when an ax shattered his head.”

In Kangaroos Goodbye Virginia Kraft
wrote “We drove to where the kangaroo
had fallen. It struggled to get 11p . . . flailing
big feet at the air and flinging its body in
voilent half-circles as if pinioned by one hip
to the ground. It was making low snorting
noises like a child trying to stifle sobs it can
no longer control . . . and all the while it
looked at us . . . with dumb hurt eyes.”

Colin McCaskill of the Sydney Office of
the Royal Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals told Australian Pent-
house, January 1980, that because of the
remoteness involved many shooters mere-
ly wound the animal leaving it to lie in
misery through the night. “That allows
them to make the kill on their return, mak—
ing the meat still fresh.”

Joeys in the pouch or at foot are
generally swung against the truck or a tree
to smash their heads or stamped to death
under a boot. Others are missed and left to
perish slowly.

To date no kangaroo products are
known to have reached the US. market.
Readers of the Information Report are
urged to be on the lookout to boycott and
protest strongly against any such products
encountered. Please write the Animal
Welfare Institute about any kangaroo
leather products, fur or meat you may see
offered for sale in the coming months.
