Chariton, Iowa

Dear Miss Tennant:

I have your telegram of July 10th requesting $1, 500, 000
to enforce laboratory animal welfare, Public Law 89~5144.

The House bill provided $300, 000. The Committee has ap--
proved $1, 200, 000. With this amount, the committee expects the
Department to expeditiously proceed with insPection and enforcement
activities necessary to insure compliance with the act. This amount
is $875, 000 over the amount available in 1967.

It is expected that the Senate will approve the committee
recommendation and, of course, the bill will have to go to
conference. It is hoped that adequate funds can be provided for
the purpose of Public Law 89-644.

Yours sincerely,

B. B. Hickenlooper
