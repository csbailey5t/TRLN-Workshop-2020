Dear Lee:

I certainly hope you do write ngngragh ‘2; the American

nsedsd to balance the often heartless wildlife management
point of View; The stony hearts of the Wildlife Legis»
lativo Fund of America people would.be included, too, I
hope. . ' ' '

You two have done wonderful work. I agree with you 7_
that human population growth is a most terrible threat
to alllifs on earth, humans.included.

The destruction of the rain forests for profit is
_anothsr broad threat that needs to be dealt with.

We are compelled to limit ourselves somewhat in order
not to be spread so thin as to be useless. but we keep
putting in an oar wherever we can.

Thanks so much for writing letters and for your generous
gift of fifty dollars.

never do too much to stop this insanity (mostly needless).

This book also is an attempt to curtail not only the
suffocation of the nation (663,000,000 people here in 2050???) but
by so doing. nrxkkping to attempt to leave more space and consideration
for creatures other than Man-~the most cruel animal that ever existed.

Blessings on you both, truly meant.

by the way, I just thought of a book partly completed which has
lain in our shelves for yearszﬁ BIOGRAPHY OF THE AMERICAN HEART.

It is the short history of a dozen or so great american
characters, well known, but taken from the viewpoint of compassion

The Last Curlew

Eskimo Curlew - Extinct 1970

The last blue shadow falls

into deep snow
Descends in that final whiteness

The glacial stillness of mastodons,
winged lizards and V .
.npn Who were too gentle

Let us dream of other worlds
Once there were unicorns

 




Last Rites

Bali Tiger - Extinct 1937

The little prince of tigers
is dead

The chime of temple bells
An army of votive arrows is offered
A long rOpe of prayer tethers the sun

Master of the emerald forest
Lord of the crystal waterfall
that feeds the sacred lake
bread foe of the Monkey King
and the.Dragon Master

He was like a flame in the forest
His fearful laughter was.in the land

Now he is the small flickering light

of an altar candle
The yellow tallow of memory

slowly flowing away

 




The Roc's Egg

Elephant Bird - Extinct 1700

i.
This was the R00
that Sinbad knew and Aladdin
For its size we called it
Elephant Bird
Towering ten feet out of the earth
Daggers for talons and a half—ton bulk
Its dark shape crossed the dunes in great strides

blocking out the malagasy sun

The tiny whirling forms
of scavenging men fleeing
Each clutched a huge egg
to his narrow breast

ii. ‘
The egg was the talisman

Three foot round, shell thick as a gold coin
Alive within -— one vast living cell

It was its own world

Like seers we held it

heavily in two hands

One egg to feed a village or a ship's crew
We drained it of life

iii. _
This was not a phoenix
None would arise from the flame
of its destruction
But the bird of the Apocalypse

The egg itself was the revelation:

_White world, barren desert of chalk
’ or empty sunbleached skull

Vision of our world to come

 




Siren Song

Steller‘s Sea Cow - Extinct 1768

Some still nights
on the shores of Bering's sea
you may imagine them

Huge as the hull
of an overturned ship
Moaning in the rolling surf

Fountain of hot blood pulsing
Furnace of the deep heart
Wave—worn giants, idle lovers
on the swell of the sea

Bigger than elephants

.Skin like the bark of an ancient oak
Snorting like horses

Pawing the kelp meadows

with their tough hooves

like bulls in pasture

Tide riders, storm biders
Slow to lust as elephants
Passionate as whales

Beauty here in a thing not itself beautiful
As delight in the play of light

on a mountain or a great rock

Yet something vastly alive

As these once were alive

Some still nights
on the shores of Bering's sea
you may.imagine them

the-great breath—song
through the sighing night

 




Taurus

Aurochs — Extinct l7h0

The last black bull's wounding

was like the bursting

of an old sun in the belly

His roar betrayed the centuries

of refusing to tread warily in this world
Flutes were made from his bones

They play them even now

And hunting horns from his ivory crown

In his veins the singing of a hundred

rapacious birds
He was strength without malice
His forehead was a crushing millstone

Fearful, lordly beast of all the mythologies
Father of the minotaur

A small part of his stubborn blood

is yet in the fighting bulls of the ring

who break the bodies of horses and men

His legend is as ancient as the pale moon
But his life now is only a fish‘s song
And his spirit is steel and flint striking

on a dark and empty plain

 




Famous Men

Garefowl or Great Auk — Extinct lBhO

Let us now praise Jon Brandsson-
and Sigourour Isleffson

who broke the skulls

of the last two Garefowl

in all the world

And let us not forget

tall, brave Ketil Ketilsson
who smashed the only egg
with his heavy boot

Less brutal, perhaps, than the feather merchants
who killed Garefowl in the tens of millions
Who used living brtds as fuel for the fires
.beneath cauldrons where bird and feather parted

Yet the Icelanders' deeds were absolute
Something unthinking in us knows
this finality

Something unthinking in us knows
this victory
As a cancer knows victory

was it the prompting of Viking blood?

Did an ancient vision govern their famous deed?
Vill‘the world tree fall?

Shall the wolf devour the sun?

Mesmerism of the killer and the killed
the terrible marriage
of victims

 




The Temple
Barbary Lion: Extinct 1920
At the gate was the god of Lions

cut in a single massive stone
and raised above the desert sand

In the time of empires
this Lion's eye was a brilliant swastika

A sunwheel on the desert wind
His voice was a stone
rolling over the roof of the world

Even the great parapet of his head

is broken now
-Ihe foundation of the temple

is cracked and wasted

- Upon the wall -
the carved images are all but gone:

vanished men pursue vanished beasts
in that ancient dream of a green
and fruitful land

 




The Howling God

Shamanu or Japanese Miniature Wolf - Extinct

Broken wolf's tooth
a charm, set in pounded gold

Ancient blood in a bronze bowl

Shogun hunted Shamanu, the little wolf,
through forests and stony fields

Horses and dogs chased him to mountains
beneath exhausted stars

In ancient days

legend gave him hypnotic power
Geese swooned before

the glowing coals of his eyes

Beneath the willow tree . _
travellers and maidens succumbed to his voice

Blood drained from their pale bodies

Shamanu, the little Howling God,

ascends the Nine Heavens
Wanders the land of nine jade rivers

and nine Jade mountains

Shamanu's blood is red amber now

his-eye is sapphire
His flash the cinnabar ore
that gives up bright quicksilver

and deadly vapour

 




The Centaurs

Tarpan — Extinct 1887

Little wild horses of the steppes
Straggling tribal men

What has the Emperor _

behind the Great Wall to fear?

He feeds on peacock tongues
His people cover the lands of the world

His power changes the course of rivers
and shapes the face of the earth

He is disturbed by_a terrible vision
He fears the image of a demon

'with eight limbs

that is fierce and swift

The Tartar horn blows
and the vision
in a whirlwind comes

At the Dragon Gate

At the Ivory Gate

the bowmen mount the towers

But the demons pass by, not against the wall

but round, their brave hearts pounding distance away

It is the frenzy of the little horses

and the savage tribal men
.Two creatures made one

The Tartar horn blows

and the Tarpan carries the tribesman on

The wall is left to the westwind

The yellow axes of the Imperial Guard are untried
The horsemen passby, pass round

The cities are pyres

The Jade images are shattered

The silk of the Imperial banners

lay tattered beneath the conqueror's hooves

 




The Excava tion

Giant Moas — Extinct 1850

The earth is pulled up

like a coffin lid

Bones like unstrung bows

' and a battlefield of broken spearshafts
Giant shin bones cracked

like diviners' yarrow‘ stalks

Beaks like shattered spearheads

The hexagrams of this dry graveyard swamp

I saw the broad clawed footprint
ofthe giant bird in clay
beneath the hump of the hill
that shadows the valley

Later we found-
a ring of Moa skulls
with a hunched chieftain's skeleton

at its centre

Clutched in his Spidery grip:
a great Moa egg

like the dragon pearl

that is the Maori moon

Sap of the Veronica wood

they called "I-ioa‘s blood"

They roasted Moa flesh on its fires
When an enemy was- defiant at the death
they called him ”fierce as the Moa"

And when the white man came

and the Maoris fell

.Jhen pestilence and war broke them

and all their world was ending

l‘hey cried out "Ka ngaro i te ngaro a te rioa
Alas, we are "lost as the :-loa is lost"

In this valley I am shaken
by a vision rising

like the dragon pearl moon
Bclipsing, for a dark hour
the bright noonday sun

,Senator Robert Dole's S. 657 to reduce animal suffering in labo~
ratories, anﬁ Congressman Clarence Long's H.R. 1797 to enﬁ use of

In both these areas, the United States is still far behind most
other western éemocracies. we must do our very ntmOst in this
session of Congress to right the terrible wrongs being inflicteé
on huge numbers of animals in laboratories and on traplines.

Both bills are moderate and have been drafted with great_care ano
much consultation to make them possible to passu~a vital considera~
tion sometimes overlookeﬁ. Copies of both are enclosed.

I would be happy to speak by phone with any writer or researcher
whom you might assign to either bill. If the writer shoulo wish
to speak with wellwinformed staff members, Mark Scanlan in Senator

Animals 1n research

 

NEWS

NATURE VOL. 301 17 FEBRUARY 1983

 

..o

COngress gears up for legislation

Washington

BIOMEDICAL researchers were warned last
week that a refusal to compromise on
animal welfare legislation may play into the
hands of militant animal rights groups that
have vowed to increase their protests in the
coming months.

The warning came from Mrs Christine
Stevens, president of the Animal Welfare
Institute, a moderate group that does not
oppose the use of animals in research but
which wants tougher rules to eliminate un-
necessary pain and distress. Stevens
appeared along with Dr Michael DeBakey,
the Texas heart surgeon, at a forum on
animal care sponsored by Howard
University in Washington DC. Howard
University was the victim of a Christmas-
night break-in by a group calling itself the
“Animal Liberation Front”, which stole
28 cats and then announced its achieve-
ment to the Washington Post. The same
group stole a dog from the Naval Medical
Center in Bethesda two weeks later.

DeBakey held to his position that current
safeguards are adequate to prevent abuses
and that new legislation would “create
more obstacles to doing research”. Under
the existing National. Institutes of Health
(NIH) rules, each institution receiving NIH
research funds must have an animal care
committee that monitors laboratory
conditions and, at some institutions,
reviews experimental protocols requiring
the use of animals. “You can besure that
they’re doing this as well as any federally-
funded policemen”, DeBakey said. “The
mere fact that abuses take place in a small
number of cases should not overshadow
the fact that most scientists want to meet
the guidelines set by NIH and the animal
welfare groups.”

Bills are expected to be reintroduced
shortly in both the House of
Representatives and the Senate, taking up
where last year’s failed efforts left off. The
cornerstone of the legislation 1n the eyes of
the Animal Welfare Institute is a
requirement that the animal committees at
NIH-supported institutions be required to
take on one outside, non-scientist member
who would specifically represent animal
interests and that the committees be
required (not just advised, as now) to
review experimental protocols.

Both bills are likely to drOp the pro-
visions in last year’s proposals that would
have required accreditation of all federally-
supported research facilities by a group
such as the American Association for the
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.
(Senator Robert Dole is drafting the Senate
bill, Representative Doug Walgren the
House bill.)

Stevens’s plea for compromise comes at
a time of increasingly militant action on the
part of more extreme animal rights groups.
An umbrella organization known as

0028-0836/83/070558-01$01 .00

 

Mobilization for Animals, which describes
itself as a “direct action” group, is
“targeting” four of NIH’ 3 seven regional
primate centres for a protest on 24 April.

Although Mobilization for Animals denies
any involvement, several of the primate
centres have reported attempted break-ins,
apparently by animal rights groups.

,The legislation may, however, be
obviated by changes that NIH itself is con-
sidering in its regulations. According to Dr
Robert Whitney of NIH, a draft of
proposed changes ‘ ‘suggested a mandatory
protocol review” by the institutional
animal committees and the inclusion of an
outside non-scientist. Whitney noted that
NIH was also initiating an inspection pro-

 

gramme to determine how well the current
system, which places the burden of respon-
sibility for enforcement on institutions
themselves, is working. The proposal has
apparently been slowed down by some of
the same opposition that DeBakey
expressed with regard to the legislation,
and is now being redraft'ed. Whitney
emphasized that its final form has not yet
been set.

DeBakey, in any event, said he was un-
impressed by the argument that failing to
support these changes would undercut the
moderates, such as Stevens, and strengthen
the extremists in the animal rights move-
ment. “It’s completely unrealistic to think
that you’re going to stop the antivivi-
sectionists who want to stop all research in
animals” with such legislation or new
rules, he said.

Contraception

 

DjeraSsi calls f0r more research

New York _

CARL DJERASSI, the Stanford chemistry
professor who 18 known as the inventor of
the contraceptive pill, continued his 15 year
campaign for more research into birth
control technologies last week in a
memOrial lecture at Rockefeller University
in New York.

Djerassi decried the obstacles, which he
called the “politics of contraception”,
standing in the way of control of the
world’s population growth. In his view, a
range of technologies is needed, including
devices for men and pOSt—conception
devices for women, in order to make birth
control more acceptable 1n the deVeloping
world’s varied societies.

One obstacle 15 the complacency caused
by international family planning pro-
grammes in the 19705, which lowered the
rate of increase in the world’s population.
Djerassi is now, however, claiming that
countries such as Mexico, which now has
approximately 70 million peOple, could
have 600 million people by 2050 if present
trends continue.

Djerassi charged that under the Reagan
Administration, the National Institutes of
Health and the Agency for International
Development have been cautious about
funding research that might be construed
as related to abortion.

Also, according to Djerassi, US
manufacturers of oral contraceptives have
been discouraged from developing new
technologies because there are as many
lawsuits filed involving oral contraceptives
as there are for all other manufactured
drugs combined.

Finally, the research programme
Djerassi favours most, the World Health
Organization’s birth control programme,
has been hurt by the continued refusal of
the United States to give funds. The pro-
gramme runs on approximately $16 to $20
million per year, contributed mostly by

 

Scandinavian countries It is successful 1n
part because it is international and avoids
the stigma that a single nation encounters
in selling so-called “genocidal” drugs to a
poor country. But the foreign operations
subcommittee of the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee has consistently blocked
US contributions. Michael D. Stein

 

Polish civil rights

 

Physicist on trial
THE opening in Warsaw last- week of the
trial of Dr Zbigniew RomaszeWski,
physicist and civil rights activist, concided
neatly with the resumption in Madrid of the
review conference on the implementation
of the Helsinki FinalAct For, although the
formal charges against Dr Romaszewski

deal with his alleged work for the

clandestine “Radio Solidarity” (he was
described in the court record as its “head
and chief organizer”), the heavy sentence
initially demanded by the prosecution ——
eight years —- suggests that his other
activities were tacitly taken into account.
In particular, Dr Romaszewski
compiled, on behalf of the “Workers’
Defence Committee” (KOR), the chief
civil rights pressure group in Poland in the
pre-Solidarity era, a report on breaches in
Poland of the Helsinki provisions on
human and civil rights, which was
submitted to the Madrid review conference
in November 1980. Like many KOR
members, Dr Romaszewski was later
closely involved with Solidarity, serving on
its National Coordinating Commission,
while his wife Zofia, also a physicist, and
now indicted with him on the “Radio
Solidarity” charge, served on the
Solidarity Warsaw Region “Intervention
Bureau” which dealt with complaints of
unjust treatment and victimization of
workers. Vera Rich

laboratory animal legislation, and there will be an article by
the head of "Action 81," whidh is an organization that is ﬂavotoo
to stopping the theft of pets for solo to laboratories. Pet
theft would lend itself well to a cartoon, so I am enclosing

some information on Action 81 for bookground.

Since we only rarely use cartoons. 1 should qualify Ehia lotto:
'by saying that any iﬁoa you may submit will, of course, havo tO'

Dear Saundra:é$

Enclosed is a listing of the pending bills and copies of them.
The Schroeder Bill, H.R. 4e06, is the one with the greatest
relevance to the 1BR case. The chapter on laboratory animal
welfare, page 46 of Animals gg§_Their Legal Rights, tells the
story of how the law was passed: ané the complete Animal Welfare
Act appears beginning page 58. Enclosed is a copy of the current
regulations under the Act. ~

I am enclosing. too, a copy of AWI's Comfortable Quarters for
Laboratory Animals whiCh we provide free on request to scientific
institutions in an effort to improve conditions for the animals.

Physical gag Mental Suffering Q§_Euggrimental Animals gives examples
from the scientific literature which, to quote Dr. Peacock's Preface,
"by ﬁesign inflict great suffering of many kinds on a variety of
animal species." He further notes, "It seems to me that great gain
for little gain is incompatible with the scientific ethic.”

Dr. Pratt's Alternatives ;g_Pain in Exggriments Q9_Animals pursues
ways in which such suffering may be mitigated or eliminated. Some
photographs of eyes of rabbits used in the Draize test appear on
page 217.

A copy of the 1966 Life article which I mentioned is also enclosed.

Please don't hesitate to call me at 337~2332 if I can be of further
help to you in preparing your article.

A Word for the Wilderness

 

GEORGE F. WILL

t is said that any stigma will do to beat a

dogma with, and environmentalism is-

often stigmatized as an “elitist” cause. It is
odd to say that removing lead from gasoline
or from paint in tenements concerns Palm
Beach more than Baltimore, or that regulat-
ing chemical wastes beneﬁts only one class.
It is less obviously wrong, but still wrong, to
say that preservation of wilderness is elitist
in any awful way.

Colorado’s Maroon Bells wilderness area
is one of the brightest jewels in the nation’s
diadem. More than 50,000 persons visit it
annually, more than visit most wilderness
areas but fewer than half the number that
watch the average Michigan Wolverine
home football game. And no wilderness
area is as heavily used as most national
parks are. (Yosemite has an indispensable
institution of civilization: a jail.)

An Irreplaceable Asset: In 1964 Con-
gress created the wilderness system,
“where man is a visitor but does not re-
main.” A 20-year “window” was left open
for leases for oil, gas and mineral claims.
As the Dec. 31, 1983, deadline approaches,
there is developing a dash for applications.
More than 1,000 are pending against 3
million acres in 200 wilderness areas, in-
cluding 30,000 acres of the Bells. Previous
administrations routinely rejected virtual-
1y all applications, but the current Interior
secretary, James Watt, wants to open up
wilderness areas. This week Congress con—
. siders a bill that would close the window,
imposing an immediate ban on leases ex-
cept in cases of urgent need afﬁrmed by
Congress.

There are 80 million acres of designated
wilderness, 56 million of them in Alaska.
Only 1.2 percent of the “lower 48” states is
wilderness; only 4 percent could ever be so
designated. Surely the nation’s vitality and
security are not so marginal as to depend on
that 4 percent. According to one study,
wilderness contains just 1 percent of the
nation’s onshore oil and gas. It would be a
pity to damage an irreplaceable asset for a
few weeks’ worth of oil. Particular wilder—
ness designations may have to be reconsid—
ered, eventually. For example, one area (the
Sawtooth Range in Idaho) contains perhaps
$1 billion worth of minerals, including co-
balt. The United States imports 97 percent
of the cobalt it uses.

Opposition to wilderness designations
comes not only from industry. It also comes
from individuals whose recreation prefer-
ences are at stake. This conﬂict may have a
class dimension, pitting plain folks in their
station wagons and motorboats against
backpackers who are suspected of packing
Brie rather than Blue Ribbon and of going
to earth in winter at Radcliffe or Grosse
Point. Pristine wilderness is an acquired
taste and is incompatible with the enjoy-

ment of some popular tastes such as dirt ‘

bikes, snowmobiles and other off-road vehi-
cles. But surely there is no shortage of space
in America for persons whose play must
involve internal-combustion engines.

All gains involve pains. Environmental

 

 

Watt may discredit
economic analysis

by seeming sympathetic
only to ecOnomic
considerations.

 

 

protection has an economic price. Wilder—
ness designation can raise the cost of many
things, from minerals to lumber, affecting
many things, from job creation to the cost of
housing. Environmentalism that is careless
about cost will be regressive in effect and
will discredit itself by seeming to be a luxury
of persons afﬂuent and callous. But the
current danger is that Watt will discredit
economic analysis by seeming sympathetic
only to economic considerations.

Part of the Watt problem is the
Watt manner: he acts like a machine in the
garden. When he testiﬁes beneath bright
television lights, his high, glistening fore-
head, his electric smile and his eyes ﬂash-
ing behind metal-rimmed glasses call to
mind a 1955 Buick, a convention of
chrome. When he speaks, you half expect
to hear gears grind, and you sort of do. He
has no patience for the toing—and—froing
practiced by persons who understand that
in politics the straightest line between
two points is rarely the easiest route. He
speaks almost too clearly, indifferent to
the bureaucratic art of constructing whole

paragraphs perfectly devoid of substance.

His cocksureness, his thirst for conﬂict,
his tone-deafness regarding his own shrill-
ness in the nuances of a subtle city—have
invigorated environmental groups and have
caused Congress to say (as a Michigan state
legislator once said), “From now on, I’m
watching everything you do with a ﬁne-
tooth comb.” He has made it easy to carica-
ture conservatism as philistine, as hostile to
all but commercial values. He sometimes
seems unreconciled to government’s stew-
ardship concerning community assets.
Some assets, such as wilderness areas, can—
not survive if unprOtected from the morals
of the marketplace.

It is a law of politics: extreme political
intensity begets equal and opposite intensi-
ty. Watt is partly a cause and partly an effect
of persons for whom environmentalism is
political romanticism masquerading as sci—
ence, a doctrine for putting sand in the gears
of industrialism and for expressing root and
branch rejection of America’s commercial
civilization. Their liking of chipmunks ex—
presses primarily a dislike of human beings,
creatures of nasty despoiling rationality.
Such environmentalists value wilderness
areas primarily as refuges from all remind-
ers that they share the planet with other
human beings.

‘The Challenge’: This nation began as an
“errand into the wilderness.” The ﬁrst, task
was to tame that wilderness, but as Wallace
Stegner says, we need to preserve some of it
“because it was the challenge against which
our character as a people was formed.”

Most Americans will never care a ﬁg
about wilderness. Perhaps that means it is.
an elitist concern. But so what? Edith Ham-
ilton, the classicist, once said» 'to Ezra
Pound: “I have heard of a great Confucian
who wrote a letter so difﬁcult there was only
one other man in all China who could un-
derstand it. That is not very democratic, I’m
afraid. That is ariStocratic, like you, Mr.
Pound.” Pound replied: “It is democratic
insofar as it provides that anyone may have
the opportunity to learn enough to read that
letter.” Enjoyment of wilderness may not be
spontaneous and “natural.” It may be a
learned process, inviting and even requiring
reﬂection. But it is nonetheless valuable for
being an aristocratic pleasure, democratic-
ally Open to all.

Dear Mr. Segera:

Thank you for your letter of August 28th. I regret
that we are not in a position to take on a full-time
writer. Please do not think of giving up your position
'with the Lakebeuse Group. However, we would like to
‘work with you,

. It seems pessible that you could research and write an
article from time to time that would be valuable for
the Animal Welfare Institute, bringing infonmation not
otherwise available to the organization and readers of
.ghgngg; Quarterly. To do something of this nature would
not. I assume, interfere with your duties as a Senior
Editorial writer. '

Can you give me an idea of cost to AWI for an article of
say 2,000 words on the International Symposium on Marine
‘Mammals?. Or a brief account, say 1.000 words, on the
efforts of Ocean Feeds, Ltd. to secure the right to kill
whales off your coasts? Incidentally, I wonder whether
the effort may have been inspired by a Japanese company
that wanted to import whale meat?

If one or the other of these_subjects appeal to you or
if you have another suggestion, we would‘be pleased to
hear it. »

Sincerely,

country and in India.

we would like to give consideration to your pcoposal; but in .
order to do so. more information frcm.yau is needed. Could you
send us a bit more background material? Are you currently
writing for the Lake House Group? How large an Honcrarium.wcnld
you require? You speak of travelling expenses; can you give an
example so that we can consider the overall cost should the
board make a favorable decision?

Have you written articles about animals and animal welfare that
have been publiahad? If ad, could you send us capies of camp
of them? . ‘

I'm intcrested to hear that there have been proposals made for
commercial whaling from.5rl Lanka. were these foreign? I
certainly hope they‘wlll not bc accepted.

THE LAST CURLCV

"...And the curlews cries instead of laughterP--Anglo-Saxon,'
10th century

Eskimo Curlew -- extinct 1970

."I saw a flock a mile long and nearly as broad....The sum
total of their distant notes resembled the wind whistling
through a ship's rigging or at times the jingle of many
sleigh bells....Hunters would drive from Omaha and fill wagon-
loads each, with sideboards on. Often they would be so well

supplied with ammunition‘that“they'would dump piles of'birds on

the prairies to rot; as large as a‘couplenof°t0ns of coal, and

then go back and shoot some more." -- Dr. Packard. ,
' Nebraska, 1860

Migrating from Canadian sub-arctic to south of the Argentinian
Campos, called the 'prairie pigeon' by the hunters of the west
and 'dough birds' by those of the eastern seaboard. All the
big flocks wiped out by 1900, a few stragglers surviving for
another half century or so. Last Numenius borealis sighted in

the late 1960's in Texas.

LAST RITBS
Bali Tiger -- extinct 1937

Once numerous on Bali, Panthera tigris balica was the smallest

of all tigers. Its head and body measurement was 5 feet, compared
with other Indian and Asian tigers which measured 8 feet without
tail. It had a distinctive delicate striping pattern. lt suffered
a massive decline after World War I because of uncontrollee

trephy hunting by Dutch colonials and local peeples who.hnc reccitly
acquired EurOpean firearms in large numbers. The last Bali figer
was shot by a policeman at Sumbar Kima, ‘Jcst Bali on 27 deotcnbcr

1937.

 




THE ROC'S EGG

Elephant Bird —- extinct 1700

The Aepyonnis Maximus or Elephant Bird of Madagascar

was probably-the'model for the Rec of mythology. This
flightless ratite stood 10 feet tall and weighed 1100 lbs.

It had an egg with a maximum circumference of nearly 3 feet.
Its fluid capacity was the equivalent of 200 chicken eggs,
120 duck eggs, 20,000 hummingbird eggs -— or as one seaman
measured it, sixteen bottles of wine.

In Aladdin and Sinbad's tales of the Rec, the theft of
the bird's egg was the one crime that none might ever
commit and survive. Neither the might of the Jinn of the
lamp or the ring could achieve such a deed, the Rec was
the master of all the world's spirits. . -
The egg was sacred and held all the secrets of the world.
Barren women who looked on its shape learned of wholeness
that no others might ever know, and were granted the gift
of bringing forth life.

TAURUS
Auroehs - Extinct l7h0

"They are but little less than Elephants in size, and are of

the Species, colour and form of a bull. Their strength is

very great, and also their Speed. They Spare neither man nor
beast that they see. They cannot be brought to endure the

sight of men, nor be tamed, even when taken young. The peOple
who take them in pitfalls, assiduously destroy them; and young
men harden themselves in this labour, and exercise thzmselves

in this kind of chase; and those who have killed a great number--
the horns being publicly exhibited in evidence of the fact ~-
obtain great honour. The horns, in amplitude, shape and species,
differ much from the horns of our oxen. They are much sought
after; and after having been edged with silver at their mouths

they are used for drinking vessels at great feasts."
Julius Caesar in his account of the

ﬁlack Forest in he Belle Gallico

nos primigenius or Taurus primigenius, as the name implies

was the archetypal bull, the wild stock from which our domestic
cattle have descended. Once found throughout Burepe and nsiu,
the Auroehs were hunted by Man for tens of thousands of years.
TLey'were massive animals, measuring 6 feet at the shoulder.

SIREN 50*. .

Steller's Sea Cow — extinct l768

Evolution‘s answer to the absurd riddle: 'Vhat would
happen to an elephant if it decided it wanted to be

a fish?’ Hydrodamalis stelleri measured 20 to 30 feet
in length and weighed up to 7 tons. It was discovered
and named by Georg Wilhelm Steller, naturalist and
physician on the last expedition of Vitus Bering in
l7hl. By 1768, 27 years after its discovery, it had

been hunted to extinction.

"Their capture was effected by a large iron hook,
the point of which somewhat resembled the fluke of an
anchor, the other end being fastened by means of an
iron ring to a very long and stout rape, held by thirty
men on shore. A strong sailor took this hook and with
four or five other men stepped into the boat, and one
of them taking the rudder, the other three or four
rowing, they quietly hurried towards the herd. The
harpooner stood in the bow of the boat with the hook
in his hand and struck.as soon as he was near enough_
to do so, whereupon the men on shore, grasping the.'
other end of the rape, pulled the desPerately resisting‘
animal laboriously towards them. Those in the boat,
;however, made the animal fast by means of another rape
and wore it out with continual blows, until tired and
completely motionless, it was attacked with bayonets,
knives and other weapons and pulled up on land. Immense
slices were cut from the still living animal, but all
it did was shake its tail furiously and make such
resistance with its forelimbs that big strips of the
cuticle were torn off. In addition it breathed heavily,
as if sighing. From the wounds in the back the blood
spurted upward like a fountain. As long as the head,
was under water no blood flowed, but as soon as it
raised the head up to breathe the blood gushed forth
anew....The old and very large animals were much more
eaSily captured than the calves, because the latter
moved about much.more vigorously, and were likely to
escape, even if the hook remained unbroken, by its
tearing through the skin....

"Hhen an animal caught with the hook began to move
about somewhat violently, those nearest in the herd
began to stir.also and feel the urge to bring succor.
To this end some of them tried to upset the boat with
their backs, while others pressed down the rope and
endeavoured to break it, or strove to remove the hook
from the wound in the back by blows of their tail, in
which they actually succeeded several times. It is most
remarkable proof of their conjugal affection that the
male, after having tried with all his might, although
in vain, to free the female caught by the hook, and in

Spite of the beating we gave him, nevertheless fbllowed
her to the shore, and that several times, even after
she was dead, he shot unexpectedly up to her like a

Speeding arrow. Early next morning, when we came to
cut up the meat and bring it to the dugout, we-found the

Garefowl or Great Auk -- extinct lth

The leg Garefowls(Alca impennis) were killed 3 June lth

on the Icelandic Eldey or Fire Island. Hunted for eggs

and meat for many centuries, the birds nonetheless survived
until the feather merchants turned their attentions on the
bird. In a very few decades they had exterminated the major
‘part of their papulations on the north Atlantic islets, until
Fire Island remained the only site.

On March h, 1971, the Director of Iceland's Natural History
Museum paid $9,000 in Sotheby's Auction rooms for a mounted
Specimen of a Great Auk. It was paid for by public
subscription and was the highest price ever paid for a
stuffed bird. '

Barbary Lion: Extinct 1920

The Barbary Lion, Panthers leo leo, was the type—race of its
species: the largest of the lions, it had a distinctive gold
mane which covered fully & of its body. This was the lion of
the Roman arenas. The last of these animals was reported killed
in the Atlas Mountains in 1922.

 




:33 EXCAVATION

 

Moas - extinct 1850

I

'Moa kai ban” --”The Moa lives on air.” -- Maori proverb.

The last Of the giant flightless birds of New Zealand, the
Moas (Dinornithiformes), died out about 1850. This was
Dinornis maximus, a 13 foot tall and 600 1b bird(—- Dinornis
means ”terrible bird".) There seem to have been over 25 species
of Moa birds on New Zealand over a 60 million year period,
however, at the time of‘the arrival of the first men -- the
Moaris in 1000 A.D.-— there were about 15 species. Over the
next eight and a half centuries, the Mdnris and later the
EurOpeans seem to have totally eliminated the entire Order.

Moas were a subject of much poetry and proverb among Maurie:
”He wha whai a moa" -- a duel between moas (ie. two fierce
fighters), "whaka toa moa" —- dance of the moa (i.e. to perform
a derisive dance in the face of the enemy), ”Moaawhango"--the
name the Maoris gave certain geysers and possibly volcanoes

which means 'Roaring Moa'.

Shamanu or Japanese Miniature Wolf -- extinct 1905

The Shamanu (Canis hodOphilax) was the world's smallest

wolf, being 14 inches at the shoulder and 2 ft 9 in in head
and body length (plus a 12 in.tail). Called the HOwling God
by the aboriginal Japanese (the Ainus), it seems to have been
greatly feared, despite its diminiutive size. Each Japanese
household had a charm to keep wolves from their door.

Last Shamanu was killed near Washikaguchi in Honshu in 1905,
its skin is in the British Museum in London.

THE CENTAURS

 

Tarpan — extinct 1887

Equus ferus or Equus tarpan is the ancestor of the modern
'warm-blood' horses: the Arabs and the Thoroughbreds. It was

a small mouse and tan coloured horse with a flowing black mane
and tail. Found at one time throughout Eurasia on plateau lands
where it was captured and bred by the tribal peeples of those
areas. The last pure-bred Tarpan in the wild was killed near
Askamia Nova in Russia on Christmas Day in 1879. The last
captive animal died 8 years later in captivity in Polanc.

' Dear Ms. Fiorman.

Enclosed is additional information, which you may wioh to

add to your files on the evolution of tho environmental an& animal
protection laws.

Some of the very early-work on the Endangered Species Act
(1966, 1969, and 1973) was done in large measure by Congressman
John Dingell's office. In 1969, thowﬁocioty for Animal Protective
Legislation was one of-the few outside organizations working on
the bill. and in 1973, the field was joined by Fund for Animals.

Friends of Animals started the Marine Mammal Protection Act,
though they disoWned it when compromising amendments were attached.

Within the last four or five yéaxs there has been a
significanincreaso in the numbers of grouéa working on legislation
and the sophistication of those groups. AMost‘of the work is
still pretty specialized, too: therefore, those of us involved
with animal issues do not even know the people who are working
for Clean Air or Clean‘Water and‘vico verso. For this reason.
it is very important to check the oXportise as the group when'
‘aoliciting its Opinion on how something happenéd.

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

I'm off and running in an hour to Los Angeles,
to do a story on Armand Hammer, but I wanted to let
you know before I take off that there's a possibility
our factory farming story may be revived for the
November issue. The editor has taken a new interest
based on the possible inclusion of a section on
the harmful presence of antibiotics in the food chain
due to drugs in animal feed-~an issue I'm sure you're
familiar with. He believes that the story will be
more hard—hitting if we can prove factory farming
is ultimately unhealthy for people as well as animals.
Anyway, over the next couple of weeks I intend to
talk up this possibility (which means not talking
up lab animals) in hopes that we can finally get
this crucial story in the magazine. I’ll let you
know what happens.

I appreciate your keeping me informed of the ups and downs 9f the

The laboratory anﬂmal bill is now out of the full Committee on
Science and Tedhnalogy, and we are wnrking hard to get action in
the Health and Environmant Sdbcammittee of the House Committea
on Enargy and Commarca. t0 which the bill has alao'been referred.
‘We also neeé a Senate aponaer.

In ease I didn’t sené ycu a copy of the enclosed letter from tha
American Physiological Saciety. I think it might'be cf intereat
to your Science Editor, Jeff Wheelwright. While H.R. 6928 (the
‘Ccmmittee bill’s naw’nuMber) is not totally nonwcantroversial,
it is closer to a cansenaua poaition than any piece of legislau
tion on this subject that.1 have ever heard of bafOre. That may
not make for a sensaticnal story. but it certainly is different:

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

I talked with Jeff Wheelwright, our science
editor, and Steve Robinson, the news editor, about
the status of the factory farming story and the
possibility of a lab animals story. Unfortunately,
both are in a rather agonizing limbo. The factory
farm story has been photographed and is just waiting
to run—~Steve thinks it is quite good, but our new
editor, Dick Stolley, formerly of People magazine,
has so far been more interested in movie stars than
veal calves, and though he hasn’t definitely nixed
the story, he hasn't given it the go-ahead either.
I'll let you know if there are any new developments
on that front.

As far as the lab animals go, Jeff says he's
been interested in the topic for some time and
was in fact intending to bring it up with Stolley~~
and this will give him the impetus to do so. But
I doubt Stolley_will appreciate the niceties of
timing which might encourage us to run the lab
story first. In any case, both subjects are being
re-broached, but it's anybody‘s guess what will
thappen. '

I hope your vacation, filled with incidental
work though I'm sure it was, provided some needed
relaxation.

I know the law is different and there are government appointed

wildlife refuges so perhaps there are no comparable organisations.

Wildlife is everywhere «- it abounds in urban
areas as; well as the countryside. It gives us
pleasure, it excites our curiosity, but it can also
prove irritating and sometimes a downright
nuisance.

We grow flowers for their beauty, we trek out to
the countryside as often as we can, but when
we see sick or injured creatures we wonder
what will happen to them. We have an urge to
help, but are frustrated by lack of knowledge.
Wild creatures are injured or killed by humans
in large numbers: trapped, poisoned, run-over,
shot, contaminated —- whatever the cause,
when we see the result we want to do
something.

A child brings in a-fledgling blackbird, you find
a fox cub, its leg mangled in a trap, an owl
caught in a tangle of netting, a snake in the
bottom of a swimming pool, a duck with a
useless wingflapping in panic . . . what should
you do?

This bobk is for all who are concerned about
animal suffering. lt advises on handling,
simple diagnosis, first aid and treatment,
feeding and housing. The authors, with their
wide and varied experience in the field, also
show how living with wildlife can be good for us
too - increasing our powers of observation,
giving us a greater understanding and thus
confidence: a truer perspective of our real
place in the world of living things.

By Patricia Curtis

Wide, Wild world
of Hope Ryden,
. bedroll naturalist

 

i A ﬁerce sense of outrage over the treatment
of wildlife turned a documentary ﬁlm maker

into prizewinning conservationist author

 

 

 

, em, . s: , . , if - a '
In the National Elk Refuge near Jackson, Wyoming,
Hope Ryden looks over the country for coyotes.

The Wyoming rancher sits at the wheel of his parked,
beat-up, four-wheel-drive truck on the windswept
ridge and watches the slim, blonde woman slowly
approaching a black mustang. She is speaking to him
softly, singsong. The wild horse eyes her cautiously,
retreats slightly, but does not run.

“Do I think she has some miraculous way with
animals? I, don’t know," muses the rancher, Lloyd
Tillett. “But I know that if she had three weeks here,
she’d get within ten feet of that wild horse.”

Hope Ryden, naturalist, author, photographer, ﬁlm
maker and wildlife defender, has come to the Pryor
Mountain Wild Horse Range, as she does every
spring, to check on this horse and his mares and foals,
as well as the other horses in this particular herd.

To go aﬁeld with HOpe Ryden is to see determina-
tion incarnate. She scales the ridges to scan the hori-
zon or, undeterred by rocks and brambles, searches
out a stream bed to look for tracks. She reads the earth

and it tells her what animals and how many went
here, and when.

Ryden intends to count every wild horse on the
Pryor Range and won’t go home until she has. She
feels it is important to know precisely how many there
are-which ones died over the winter, how many mares
have living foals. That way exact ﬁgures can be pre-
sented if the herd is assumed to be approaching over-
population. Ryden is an indefatigable activist on be-
half of these dwindling symbols of the Old West.

“Sergeant Pryor has a new mare," she comments as
she climbs back into the cab of the truck. “That young
sorrel with the white blaze wasn’t in his harem last
year. She must be that ﬁlly from the bay’s harem—she
was two years old last year, remember? Sergeant Pryor
must have lured her away.”

Tillett, a Bunyanesque mountain of a man, long-
time friend of both Hope Ryden and the Pryor Moun-
tain mustangs, swings the truck into grumbling mo-
tion. It bounces slowly along the rutted, rocky, un-
graded path that serves as a road in this wilderness,
which 12 years ago was set aside as a refuge for one
of the last herds of America’s wild horses.

“Horses!” she cries, bringing her binoculars to her
eyes. Tillett brakes and looks in the direction she indi-

cates. This experienced outdoorsman can see nearly

as well with his unaided eyes as the rest of us can with
binoculars. He and Hope Ryden joke about a govern-
ment ofﬁcial who once referred to “ocular reconnais-
sance”—-“He meant- he went out and eyeballed the
situation,” guffaws Tillett.

What strikes a novice upon ﬁrst attempting horse
counting in the Pryors is how difﬁcult it is to spot the
animals. Miss Ryden and Tillett can gaze at a hillside
two miles away. and discuss the colors of the six or
eight horses there, plus all their foals (“There’s an-
other one, a black one, lying in the grass,” Miss Ryden
will exclaim).

The ﬁrst mustangs were feral animals, Once domes-
tic and descended from the noble mounts of the con-
quistadors. They still exhibit qualities of that blood-
line—smallish, compact, often with one less lumbar
vertebra, like Arabians. It looks as though the breed
tries to make up for that missing-vertebra by growing
a longer tail, for the tail of the Pryor Mountain muse
tang is no brushy little appendage but a glorious fall
of hair that may skim the ground at its heels. They
move so surefootedly and lightly they seem to ﬂoat.

The mustangs were traded or stolen from their
original Spanish owners by Indians in the 16th and
17th centuries. During many years of Indianwarfare
and migrations, some two million horses escaped and

went wild. The early explorers in the 18005 encount-
ered herds of them sweeping across the land. Settlers
helped themselves to these horses whenever they could
catch and tame them. The modern cow pony owes
much to its mustang antecedents. As the West became
settled, the dwindling herds were heavily depleted by
the practice of mustanging—running down the ani-
mals, capturing them, and sometimes brutalizing
them into submission or death.

“Today mustangs are threatened by loss of habitat.
They are resented by many cattle growers in places
where the horses share the public land with livestock,"
points out Hope Ryden. “And the hunting establish-
ment would also like the mustangs off the public land
because they believe the horses compete for food with
game animals.

“It was the mustang that made me become a bedroll
naturalist. I had been a documentary ﬁlm maker,
came out here with a crew in 1968 to make a ﬁlm about
mustangs for ABC television news. I learned that these
horses had absolutely no protection from abuse or ex-
ploitation. There they were on public lands, harming

A ﬁeld with H ope Ryden, naturalist no one, at the mercy of anybody who came along. Be-

 

cause they were feral, they did not enjoy the legal
status of a wild animal and consequently the protec-
tion of legislation. I realized that if I was going to help
them effectively, I'd have to learn about them ﬁrst-
hand. So I spent three years studying them, living for
months at a time in many of the places they existed. I
had never been happier. I wrote three books about
them, and never went back to ﬁlm making full-time.”

The mustang is not without friends. The American
Horse Protection Association, a vigilant, politically
sawy group, has fought in the courts for seven years
on their behalf.

Miss Ryden is an adviser to the AHPA and an ac-
tive board member of Defenders of Mldlife. Her tes-
timony before Congress helped pass the “wild free-
roaming horses and burros” Act in 1971, and when
the Act was challenged she presented an amicuscuriae
brief before the Supreme Court. The Act's constitu-
tionality was upheld and the horses’ right to exist was
guaranteed, at least legally.

Face-to-face encounter with a wolf

Hope Ryden was born in St. Paul, grew up in Illi-
.. y . nois, but every summer her family retreated to a cabin
p p . .. l in the woods of northern ’Wisconsin. There were few

' ‘ other children for miles around the Rydens' cabin, so
she became accustomed to spending hours in the for-
est alone, watching animals. She recalls a time when
she was about nine years old, meeting one of the last
wolves in that part‘of the country: “I was walking in
p the woods when all of a sudden, there it was. We

' looked at each other for a long moment. That wild
animal struck a deep note in me.”

She earned her bachelor's degree at the University
of Iowa, did graduate work at Columbia, and began
a career in ﬁlm making. She wrote, produced and
directed some 40 ﬁlms that took her all over the world,
and was one of the group funded by Time Inc. that
transformed documentaries from staged movies to the
authentic cinéma vérité they are today.

Hope Ryden regards her coyote studies as her most
signiﬁcant work. This greatly misunderstood and
much-maligned animal shares with the wolf a mythi-
cal and grandiose reputation for evil. It is regarded as
a marauder capable not only of decimating whole
ﬂocks of sheep but of bringing down deer, cattle, even
.. ‘~ elk on the hoof. “In truth, its main diet is carrion and

_. . .. small rodents," Miss Ryden explains. “In areas where

hunting has limited the amount ofcarrion and pois-
oning programs have eliminated rodents, some coyotes
have acquired the habit of feeding on sheep."

In the Florida Everglades, more suited to alligators, Coyotes are the most persecuted animals in the

hundreds of thousands of them each year, by sheep
ranchers and by federal agents.

“I ﬁrst became interested in these animals in the
late Sixties while I was doing my wild horse studies,"
she recalls. “But though there’s plenty of lore .about
them, I found very little information except about
their migrations and efﬁcient methods of killing them.
The late, great biologist Adolph Murie had made a
peerless study documenting the animal’s crucial role
as'a scavenger in the food chain of an ecosystem. But
there were no reliable behavior observations. Canis
latrans has been hunted so relentlessly, the survivors
have become extremely clever and elusive."

Miss Ryden began her ﬁeld studies of coyotes in
Wyoming, including two winters in Yellowstone,
tramping alOne on snowshoes or cross-country skis
every day into the closed park to observe the coyotes
search for food in the snow-shrouded wilderness. The
ﬁrst spring, in the National Elk Refuge, she discovered
a den of pups. Sitting day after day in an irrigation
ditch or in a hay shed where she could keep the ani-
mals in view through her 20-power spotting scape, she
realized she was seeing the social behavior of a coyote
extended family-which had always been presumed

not' to exist. She was the ﬁrst to publish observations
of “baby-sitting”—tending and feeding the young—by
an “aunt" or “uncle” coyote.

National Geographic magazine became interested
in what Hope Ryden was reporting and offered to
fund another season. So the following spring she got
permission to go off-road in a van in the Elk Refuge
and searched until she found the same coyotes she
had studied the previous year, at a new den.

“I knew you could never fool a coyote,” she says.
“And I knew they would never tolerate a person on
foot coming close. But I thought they might put up
with me in the van so long as they couldn’t see me.
So I determined never to show my face."

Coming close to “God’s dog"

For seven weeks, she rose with the dawn and aimed
her binoculars or her camera through the curtained
door of the van, making notes, taking photographs.

Her unique study of these canines contributed much
valuable insight about them and disproved some of the
myths. She borrowed the Navajos' name for the coyote
for the title of her book: God’s Dog.

Some time ago, as now seems natural, Ryden gave
up eating meat because, with her feeling for animals,
it didn’t go down that well and also because she feels
the scent of a meat-eater casts a predatory aura, enough
to repel the animals she wants to get very close to. She
has a way, this elegant, attractive woman, sitting at the
table with you in a fancy restaurant, of looking a long
way out into the distance. No one, you feel, could be
more tolerant of a poisonous spider, or a rattlesnake
she unwittingly stepped on (which she has).

To help subsidize her extensive ﬁeldwork, she some-
times returns to ﬁlm making. She spent the better part
of a year in Florida making a ﬁlm on the coastal wet-
lands for the Public Broadcasting System, and it was
during her work there that she caught sight from time
to time of a species of small, delicate, very beautiful
native deer. “Nobody could tell me much about them
except that they had been hunted to the edge of ex-
tinction and were now protected," she says.

Her interest led to another year of ﬁeldwork. “I be-
gan tramping through the mangrove thickets. The
mosquitos were awful! Compared to them, the snakes
and alligators there were nothing. I wore netting over
my face and washed my clothes every night in mos-
qui to repellent."

Another prob'fem she encountered was that in the
spring, when she wanted to photograph fawns, she
couldn’t ﬁnd where the does had hidden them. Infant
deer are well cambuﬂaged, and their inborn ability to
remain immobile is extraordinary. They spend the
ﬁrst four weeks of their lives virtually alone, hidden

123

 




and motionless in the grass, visited by their cautious
mothers for perhaps only 30 minutes a day for nursing.

Some local people who became friends of Miss
Ryden allowed her to observe three semitame deer
that came into their yard to be fed. One day she hap-
pened to meet one of those does in the woods. The
animal didn’t run away, and she talked to it for a
while. When the deer began to move on, she didn't
seem to mind being followed. The doe led her through
the mangroves to a higher ring of vegetation where
buttonwood trees grew. The doe stepped into a clear-
ing, and there was her fawn.

“I had been hunting in the wrong place. The doc
had shown me where to ﬁnd fawns—in the button-
woods and not in the mangroves,” Ryden recalls.
“Later on, in the fall, I concentrated on photograph-
ing bucks.” Her observations and photographs of these
deer (p.120) resulted in The Little Deer of the Florida
Keys. It won four awards.

“I once read a magazine article entitled ‘You'll
Never See a Bobcat)" says Miss Ryden. “But I,-with
all the arrogance in the world—that’s the animal I took
on next. I would never have attempted it if I had
realized what I now know about how furtive and re-
clusive bobcats are.”

She began studying bobcats in her usual fashion. “I

some, I just stay where they are. I quietly blend into
the landscape and wait, maybe for days and weeks.
The animals study me long before I ever see them.

“Do I carry a gun for protection? No—never. I be-
lieve animals know when you're armed—they pick it
up from subtle changes in your body language, and
they make sure you never see them. And I always have
to be alone when I'm doing a ﬁeld study. If you're
with someone, you talk; also, there’s twice the human
smell for the animals to pick up.

“I am perfectly happy to live anywhere under any
conditions when I’m working. My Work is an endless
learning process. In the ﬁeld, I just watch the animals,
take photographs and make notes. Then I go home to
NewlYork and plug into the great energy battery the
city provide-s and do my writing." (An article on bob-
cats by Hope Ryden, illustrated with her photographs,
will appear in a future issue of SMITHSONIAN.)

One secret Hope Ryden guards is her age. Another
mystery is why she has never married. “She came close
once, but she wouldn’t tell him her age, so the whole
deal fell through,” Lloyd Tillett cracks.

Her own comment is: “I might ﬁnd myself with

Ontario farm to find solace in a different environment.
He chose the sea, and spent six months exploring the coast-
line of Northwest North.America.... VOYAGE is a vivid
account of the natural splendors of the coast."

-Publishers weekly

 

Suddenly confronted by mortality, R.D. Lawrence experienced a
true mid-life crisis following the death of his wife Joan. To heal the
pain of his loss, Lawrence bought a twenty-four—foot cruiser, which he

named the Stella Maris and began a solitary six month journey:

 

' ..Those who have lost a great love will knOW'hOW it is
at such a time, while those who have not.will be unable
to fully grasp the awesome depth of despair that envelopes‘
the mind.... In short I was going through the motions of
living, but I didn't care about life itself.... I ran,
this time to another part of the wilderness...."

-fr0m VOYAGE OF THE STELLA

 

Born on a ship and raised on the shores of the Mediterranean, Lawrence
was no stranger to the demands of the sea. But from the very beginning
of his journey -— when he shattered several ribs while struggling to
prevent the Stella from running aground -- he found living afloat even
more challenging than he had anticipated.

lammence had set out to study the creatures of the Pacific, from
shrimp and crabs collected in specimen jars to sea lions and hair seals
observed in their natural habitats. But it was his contact with the largest
creatues that inspired the fear and elation that made him.so sharply aware

of his own mortality yet at the same time made hinifeel so joyfully alive.

and communed in ahmost mystical mutual fascrnation. He had equally dramatic
encounters with other denizens of the deep: fending off a shark with.his

bare fists, having an octopus literally eating out of his hands, and playing

 




with a school of Dall porpoises.

In VOYAGE OF THE STELLA, Lawrence recaptures the sights , sounds ,

same warmth and concern for living things so notable in his other widely

"The book is captivating. . . sensitive moments, quietly and
richly described. In celebrating 'the unabashed honesty
of the breed,‘ Mr. Lawrence reveals not a little of his own
honesty and offers insight into the psychology of the lone
human. "
-Barry Lopez , The New York Times Book Review

 

Secret Go the Wolves --

 

" [Fascinating] , enjoyable and totally believable. . . Iawrence's
descriptions of the changing seasons and the wild countryside
are truly lyrical . As each chapter unfolds , we are indeed
engagingly led to learn more about the world to which we
belong and its so—called lesser creatures . "

-Smithsonian

 

The Zoo That Never Was —-

 

"R.D.Lawrence could be described as the Gerald Durrell of
Ontario's north country. A biologist, he has a clinical
interest in animals; he also has a gift for understanding
and writing about them. Readers who enjoyed his earlier
books. . . will be enchanted by this one."

-Publishers Weekly

 

ABOUT THE AUTHOR:

 

R.D. Lawrence is the author of thirteen books on wildlife and

ecology, including Paddy, the story of the orphan beaver; The North Runner,

 

about an unusual wolf-dog; Secret Go the Wolves, about Lawrence' s

 

experiences raising two wolf cubs; and The Zoo That Never Was, in which

Bear Dr. Russell:

In your latter at January 26th, you asked ma if I had any thoughts
on articlas concerning marine mammals, anpecially whales and
dolphins.

Dr. Rnger Payne, whose Schweitzer medal accaptance speech I
thought wan outatanding. might be persuadea to write an article
for you. He is immensely knowledgeable ana always interesting.

Scott MbVay has long been interested in both whales and dolphins.
He wrote an opmed piece for Egg New*¥ork Times a few'yeara aga on
dolnhins and wan instrumental in having the film ”In Search of
the BaWhead Whale“ proaucea.

Sidney Holt cf the Food and Agricultura Organization is an
extremely knowledgeable scientist capable of effective expres~
Sion of his ideas on Whales.

As~you may‘knaw, Phoebe Wray in editing the Symposium on Cetacean
Intelligence and Behavinr whidh was held in washington, D. C. a
couple of years ago. We hepe it will nonn‘be out in book foam,
’and ynu may gat other iﬁnas from this as wall.

Frank Robson, who wrote ghinking Dolphins, TalkingWhales, is
another possibility.

If you neeé any addresses, wn cauld supply them. Best wishes,

Dear Christine,

Thank you so very much for your letter of January 20, with all
of the extremely interesting and important suggestions. I
very much agree with you that an important aim of the magazine
should be to raise the level of understanding and respect

for animals, and we shall endeavor to make this an important
part of each issue.

I am especially intrigued with the idea of an article by
Iain and Oria Douglas—Hamilton on the Lake Manyara elephants
(and perhaps, all African elephants). I read "Among the
Elephants" several years ago and was thrilled by it. Do you
have an address for them?

Any thoughts you have on articles concerning marine mammals,
especially whales and dolphins, would also be much appreciated.

Thank you again for your interest. I look forward to further
communication with you in the future.

With every good wish,

George K. Russell, Ph.D.

Dear Don Lessem,

Thank you for your letter of October 23 to Christine Stevens
and your inquiry about our assistance in producing a children's
newsletter on the environment. She has been out of the office
and asked me to answer you promptly. -

The idea isia good one, but unfortunately we are not in a
position to take it on. Right now we are producing a book
to be used by junior high and high school students working on science
fair and other projects which emphasizes endangered species. If
you have any recommendations for projects for this book, we would
be interested in considering them.

Have you contacted the Humane Society of the United States?
They produce a children's magazine, Kind, and may be interested
in a column or insert for their publication. In Massachusetts,
the American Humane Education Society (part of the MSPCA) at one
time published a newsletter for children. They might be interested
in your services, particularly if the ohblication were directed to
activities that would highlight their new Macomber Farm. ‘Judy
Starr is the education director for AHES.

Thank you for Life is No Yuk for the Yak. It is delightful.

Sincerely,

Dear Ms. Stevens:

Though I doubt you recall, we corresponded when I was coordinator
of endangered species information for a Smithsonian-affiliate in
Cambridge, the Center for Short—Lived Phenomena. The Center has long
since gone under as a private non-profit, taking with a newsletter for
young peOple on the environemnt which I created and am still eager to

put out. Meanwhile, as you see by the stationery, I have been keeping
busy writing on nature and nonsense for a variety of publications.

I am writing to inquire if A.W.I. would be interested in sponsor-
ing a revised Version ofmy ARK NEWS as a regular information source
on the developments in the animal world for young peOple. As you may
know, no publication now fills this need.

I'd be happy to discuss this prospect with you and am planning
a research trip to Washington in the near future. I look forwardato
the possibility of hearing from you soon.

Best wishes.

VICUNA

CRE ATURE

Good news! The VICUNA is back.
Just eight years ago, the little relative
of the camel stood on the brink of ex-
tinction. Fewer than 15,000 vicuﬁa
roamed the earth. Now under careful
supervision, the vicuﬁa population has
increased quickly. In one country,
Peru, there are now more than 40,000
vicuﬁa.

The vicuﬁa lives high in the Andes
Mountains of South America. In the
summer, herds of these wild creatures
feed on cactus below the snowy moun-
tain-tops. Before the winter begins, the
vicuﬁa move to the ﬂat and rolling
range where they munch on grasses.

Several hundred years ago, more
than a million vicuﬁa grazed through-
out the Andes. Native Indian shep-

herds sheared the animal’s shaggy coat I

to make wool.These herders never ,
harmed the vicuﬁa, nor its relatives,
the wild guanaco, and the tame alpaca
and llama. How then did the vicuﬁa
become so rare?

Nearly extinct just eight years ago, today the vicuﬁa is protected in South America.

The answer lies, in part, in the way
the vicuﬁa behaves. When scared, an
entire herd of the fast-running animals
may suddenly come to a stop. This be-
havior has made the vicuﬁa an easy
target for modern, gun-carrying hunt-
ers.

The vicuﬁa also had to compete with
other animals for space and food.
Packs of wild dogs often‘chased the vi-
cuﬁa, preventing it from eating enough
food to survive.

To protect the vicuﬁa and its habi-
tat, governments have set aside land

I as national parks, such as the Pampas
Galeras in Peru. Watching over the vi-
cuﬁa can be dangerous work. Poachers
who illegally hunt the—animals, have
killed a game-warden in Pampas Ga-
leras.

To discourage illegal hunting, sever-
al countries have prohibited the trans-
port of vicuﬁa fur across their borders.

. In the U.S., the laws forbidding this

trade will expire within the next two
years. If these laws are not renewed,
the vicuﬁa may be in danger once
more.

LOUSY LOUSE WORT
OR DARN DAM

A rare plant from Maine has sudden-
ly become vezy important. The yellow—
ﬂowering plant is the FURBISH’S

LOU SEWORT , and it stands less than
1 meter high.

 

 

A U.S. law protecting endangered
species may halt construction on two
major dams. The law is the Endan-
gered Species Act of 1973, and it pro-
tects the home region of plants and

The lousewort gets its peculiar name
from an ancient belief that cattle graz-
ing on the plant would become covered
with tiny bugs called lice, (lice is the
plural of louse). The Furbish variety of

lousewort is named for Kate Furbish, a

painter and nature-lover who discov-
ered the plant in 1880, While on a hike.

animals in peril of disappearing for-
ever. These home regions are called
critical habitats. The two critical habi-
tat cases described below are now the
subject of great controversy.

Until recently scientists thought
that. the Furbish’s lousewort had disap-
peared from its swampy homeland in
Maine and New Brunswick, Canada.
But last year, a small number of the
plants were discovered in northern
Maine. The louseworts inhabit an area
that the proposed Dickey-Lincoln dam
would ﬂood over. If the U.S. govern-
ment built the dam, the only known
Furbish’s louseworts would be de-
stroyed. _ ' _ . _

Conservationists argue that we must
preserve the endangered lousewort and
its wild setting. Opponents say that
the dam will provide much-needed jobs
and inexpensive electricity. They say
there may be other Furbish’s
louseworts not yet discovered, and sug-
gest transplanting, moving the exist-
ing louseworts to another location.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is
now searching Maine for other Fur-
bish’s louseworts. If the Army Corps

does not ﬁnd the louseworts elsewhere
the Dickey-Lincoln dam will not be

built.

THE SNAIL DARTER
WINS THE RACE

The. SNAIL DARTER is only ten
centimeters long. But this little brown
ﬁsh is holding up construction on a
$110 million dam.

The U.S. government stopped con-

But the snail darter is neither brightly
colored nor good to eat.

People who favor the Tellico dam
point out that the dam has already
cost taxpayers $100 million and is 90%
completed. They say the dam will pro-
duce needed electrical power.

Those who want to stop the dam con-
struction say that we should not de-

stroy a life-form. They also argue that
the dam would provide less than 1%
additional power to the Tennessee Val-
ley, and would destroy farmland.

Like the Furbish’s lousewort, the
snail darter still faces tests in the
courts. In addition, the snail darter
case will undergo review by the U.S.
Congress this summer.

. Why? The dam would have destroyed

The MALAYAN WREATH-BILLED
HORNBILL is hard to ﬁnd in its native
land, the forests of Malaysia and Indo-
nesia. But it’s not in danger of disap-
pearing. The Malayan hornbill is one of
45 species of hornbill. Hornbills are
found in such distant places as Africa
and the Philippine Islands.

People have been successful in an-
other effort to help raise baby birds. For
the ﬁrst timemever in captivity, a Malay-
an wreath-billed hornbill was hatched at
the Bronx Zoo in New York on April
18,1977.

The little bird with the big beak still
has no name. It’s too early yet to tell if
the bird is a male or a female. But soon
the hornbill will develop a blue-spotted
beak and reddish eyes if it’s a male, or
a yellow-spotted beak if it’s a female.

The zoo-keepers have been feeding
the new Bronx baby both fruit and
meat. Hornbills are omnivirous, mean-
ing they eat all types of food.

And why do hornbills have such huge
beaks? Those bills are useful tools for
digging nest-holes in trees.

the last stretch of free-ﬂowing water in
the Tennessee Valley. That water is
the critical habitat, the only home, of
the snail darter.

Darters earned their name from the
quick way in which they shoot out
from hiding spots when frightened or
hungry. Many darter species are found
‘in the streams of the U.S. from the At-
lantic coast to the Mexican border. All
darters are related to the good-tasting
perch. Some species are quite colorful.

—YOUR TURN

Hold your own mock court on the cases of
the lousewort and the snail darter. Appoint a
judge, prosecutor, defendant, and jury.

Consider the two cases together. Which is
more important to you—saving these creatures

or building the dams? Are there any other al-
ternatives?

Let your government know what you think.
These cases will be reviewed by the Senate

WllllllPINli SHANE IIIES

A 'WHOOPING CRANE,one of the

 

world’s rarest birds, was found dead be-

 

side a Wyoming highway on May 28.
The cause of death has not yet been de—
termined.

The young crane was one of 3 hatched
this year by sandhill cranes in a joint
U.S.-Canadian government program to
increase the whooping crane population.
Since nearly half of all whooping crane
young do not survive their ﬁrst year,
wildlife ofﬁcials moved several crane
eggs from their natural habitat to the
protected nests of the sandhill crane.
Five wh00ping cranes were successfully
raised last year by this transplanting
program.

Scientists who have counted the eggs
at the Canadian nesting grounds of the
wild wh00ping crane believe that the
population of whoopers will increase.

.. once again this year. Only 89 whoopmg
cranes now ﬂy the skies over the U.S.
and Canada.

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing to you to request any information you can send me regarding
animal experimentation. I am writing an article with Susan Hudgens on
animal experimentation, which we hope to have published in one of the
Seattle daily newspapers. I have enclosed a copy of an article we just
had published regarding the Burger King boycott and veal production.

The newspaper was quite receptive to our article and we hope that will
aid us in having them print the one on experimentation.

Our friend, John Hosum, of the Progressive Animal Welfare Society (PAWS)
in Lynnwood, Washington, will be making any information he has available
to us, i.e. problems at the University of Washington, etc. I have seen
your organization's name listed in various books as a reference for
articles and have the feeling that you may be able to supply us with some
valuable information.

I will gladly pay for any materials you can send, including postage. I
would like to find out more about your organization, so please send me an
application, etc. Susan and I are very concerned about the plight of
animals today and want to do all we can to help.

Thank you in advance for your help. Hopefully a lot of people will read
the article and become more aware of how animals are treated and do some—
thing about it.

Sincerely,

ﬂmgﬁm

Deena Jones

Dear Gearge,

I’m delightad to hear that yea will be the editor of Oricn‘s
succe330r. I‘m sure it will be much appreciated act only by all
who were ﬁorry to see Orign disappear but to the many wha I
think wogld have subscribed to it if they had known it existed.

You are wise to continua to glace amyhasis an the reviaws of
Abooks, I think, anﬂ I'm glad you'll incluée articles which will
raiae the level oﬁ underatanﬂlng of our fallow animals ané in~

. crease respect for them. I hoye there will be a lot about ani»
mals themaalvea, not only diacussions of ethics and what people
can or shoulﬁ do, for I believe a juﬁicious mixture will be more
agpealing to a larger public 59 that the magazine will stand a
good chance of success.

For axample, the amazing progress in cammunicating with the
great apea makes fascinating reading. Dr. Roger Fauts has
recently started Project washoe and could write an intaresting
article which weuld be both very humane anﬁ solidly scientific.

Eugene Linden who co~authored tha recently published “Educa~
tion of Rake“ with Francine Patteraon ( about the gorilla) is an
accamplished writer. He wrote “Apes, Men and Language” earlier.

A splendid poet who is having a small beak of poems on
andangered spacies published is Davié Day, author of “The Dooma~
day Bock of Extinct.Animal$." just publisheé. His poems and
prose are-both very moving. and his research into the causes of
extinction well grounﬂed.

 




Hope Ryden is an author who lives with hot subjects in the
wild one writes about them with tremendous sympathy. “God‘s Dog,”
“Bobcat Year,” "The Little Deer of the Florida Keye“-ore among
her books. she has frequeatly testified against poisons one
traps and for protection of wild horses.

Ruth Herrieon author of ”Animal Machines,” the pioneering
book against the crueltiee of factory farming. is another good
writer who eat at the knee of George Bernard Show in her youth
one who has etuoied the matters who writes about with meticulous
care. '

Diane Foeeey feels paoeionately for the gorillas she has
fought.eo hero to~oave and might write a fireteoloee article
about the struggle.

If Iain and 0:13 Douglae~Hamilton would bring us up to date'
with an article on the fight to save elephants in.Afrioa, you 1
might get something of the quality of their magnificent book, :
ﬁhmong the Elephants.“ 3

Lord Boughton, a Labor poor who pioneered “Putting Animale‘o
into Politics” in England is an excellent forceful eyeaker ‘
ﬂeepite his advanced age, and I ﬁhiﬂk an article from him on
the efforts he is making to improve protection for laboratory
animals in Britain and. through the Council of Europe for other
countries. might be very interesting. 0: he might orefer to
write about the political aspects of fights for animal welfare
generally.

Sylvia Townoend Warner wrote about hone rescued from battery
cages in a most compelling brief account. Riohard Adams wrote
for The Beast before it foldeﬁ. He woulé surely write for you,
too.

I have quite a few other ideas but muet close for now and
would rather get thie off to you than hole it till I have time
to write more.

Best wishes for eucceos: A really good magazine in this fielo
is greatly needed.

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens

P.O. Box 3650
Washington, D.C. 20007

Dear Christine:

As you may know, it recently became.impossible to continue
publication of Orion Nature Book Review. In the intervening
weeks, we have received many letters of regret expressing
the wish that the magazine could be continued in some form.
Perceiving that the publication had served a genuine need,
the Myrin Institute, a small educational organization, has
decided to publish a new quarterly magazine as a successor
to Orion. They have asked me to serve as editor.

 

Man's relationship to the natural world is being defined to-
day in many areas: animal husbandry, agriculture, education,
wildlife management. In articles on the philosophical and
practical developments in these fields and many others, the
Orion Nature Review will explore this relationship for the
intelligent general reader. At the deepest level, the
magazine hOpes to make apparent man's moral responsibility
for other forms of life and for the world he lives in. Two
feature articles, 3000—3500 words each, will provide a forum
for authors who have significant thoughts on this subject.
The topics might encompass animal rights, humane education,
alternative forms of agriculture, the present status and future
of wildlife and natural ecosystems, and other related themes.

 

Please note that these feature essays will not be limited in
scope to the discussion of books, as was the case in the ear-
lier magazine. The new Orion, however, will again include
reviews of a wide spectrum of books on nature and the environ—
ment.

I would like to enlist your aid in refining the thrust of the
new publication.

 




Mrs. Christine Stevens January 5, 1982

Could you provide us with a list of themes which
you feel deserve attention in feature articles?

Do you have an idea, problem, statement, favorite
theme on which you would be willing to write a
feature article (for suitable remuneration)?

3. Can you suggest the names of other authors who
might wish to contribute to our venture?

I am enclosing a copy of the final issue of Orion Nature Book
Review, so that you will have a ready reference regarding

our previous efforts. The editorial staff of the earlier pub—
lication will join me to work on the new magazine.

 

I would greatly appreciate your thoughts and suggestions,
and am most grateful for your time and consideration. I look
forward to hearing from you.

With every good wish,

George K. Russell, Ph.D.

I was happy to note from your letter that the portions about whale
killing in Japanese Buddhism that appear in To Cherish.All Life
were helpful to you at the meeting of the International whaling
Commission.

 

Could you also send to me in MeXico the information report in
which the announcement 0f the availability 0f the book is men~
tioned? That bit 0f information might be helpful in material we
put out promoting the book.

Two books which I previously got from the Institute, Hans Ruesoh‘s
Slaughter of the Innocent and Henry Salt's Animals' Rights, have
both been enormously inspiring. I received these books too late
to mention them in To Cherish All Life, but I will certainly in«
clude them in any future printings.

 

 

Thank you for yoor help.

Dear Deborah:

. Thank you very much for sending the interesting book, "To Cherish

All Life.“ It arriVed in my absence. but Fran Lipscomb, who
represented the Animal Welfare Institute at the International

Whaling commission-meeting which ended last Saturday. took xerox
copies of the pages referring to whale killing and Japanese

Buddhism, and she said they were of much value there. We will'
announce the availability of the book in a future "Information
Report.“

In case it may be reprinted in the near future. I want to give you

an update which should be incorporated on page 13. In 1978. an
amendment to the Federal Meat Inspection Act extended humane slaughter
requirements. I enclose further information about this. Even before
this helpful broadening of the law, the Humane Slaughter Act covered
between 80 and 90 percent of the animals slaughtered. This is because
the big packers own most of the slaughterhouses.

‘Roshi Kapleau might also wish to refer to abuses at livestock auc—
tions in a future edition. I am very glad that he started out with
factory farming, which is becoming worse and worse.

I hope Greens is having a great success. Kindest regards,

Bincerely,

Christine Stevens

Dear Christine,

Roshi Kapleau has asked me to send you a comp~

Life. Please notice the section on Whale Kill-
ing and Japanese Buddhism on page 49.

 

We at the Zen Center strongly support your
organization's efforts towards the ending

of cruelty and slaughter of animals. If it
is possible for you to review go Cherish All
Life in your book review section of the news—
letter, it would be most appreciated.

 

The book is available from the Zen Center,
and I enclose an order form in the event
that you need one.

Thanks for your letter of February 18th. Under separate cover
I'm sending you s copy of AWI's latest publication. “The~Bird Busi-
ness, A Study of the Commercial Cage Bird Trade." There is lots of
material for an article in it. and catching smugglers is quite a
fascinating sport. Fages 74~77 give some recent successes.

‘ We are anxious to get the word out about this disastrous trade

No doubt you read about the recent "sting“ operation by the
Fish and Wildlife Service special agents on walrus ivory in Alaska
and four other states. Enclosed is a copy of an article from an '
Alaskan newspaper and also of my testimony, on behalf of the Society
for Animal Protective Legislation. seeking more adequate appropria-
tions to enforce the laws designed to protect wildlife.

If you saw the article in this Sunday‘s ggngork Times about
the meeting now in progress in New Delhi of the 67 nations who are
party to the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora, you know that parrots and whales are the
biggest issues there. An article on CITES would be timely. Fran
Lipscomb is there for the Animal‘welfare Institute and the Society
for Animal Protective Legislation and she'll be glad to answer any
.questions you may have on her return in the middle of March.

Mr. M. Philip Copo'
500 East 85th Street

Dear Mr. Coop,

 

Thanks for sending me the piece about the nimal Medical Center.
I read it with interest. However, it isoutsﬁ®2 the areas in which
the Animal welfare Institute is working, so I am not able to give
you suggestions about other publications which might be interested,

in it.
Also, I had a very bad experience with/éblggfzs ago. A child~

hood friend of mine died while I was out of the country when I A
returned I learned her cat, anraltered ﬂraEewhom I had never seen,
had been sent to the Animal~Medical Center to be held for adoption.
I immediately phoned to see if the cat wag still there, was told
it was, and went there and picked it up. My mother said she would
care for it, and a few weeks later the cat had kittens! Obviously,
it was not my friend's cat. This degree of carelessness in the
handling of individual animals has left a bad taste in my mouth.

I believe a completely different staff is now in charge and trust
that great improvements have been made.

If you are interestdd in writing more articles concerning
animal welfare, I would be géad to send you background material on
trapping, factory farming, laboratory animals, eddangered species,
whales, dolphins, predatorscontrol and otheresubjects. Enclosed is
a listin and a few Information Re orts. I thought your article was
very wel written, and I hone you will decide to write a comprehensive
article on one or more of these subjects.

Sincerely,

 

Christine Stevens

DIANE DOWNS

ossibly the best hospital in New York

City, and certainly the best of its kind

in the world, is located on East 62nd
Street, just off York Avenue. It has one
major drawback, however: no matter how
great your wealth or influence you never
will be admitted as a patient—not unless
you happen to be an animal of a species oth-
er than man.

The name of this exclusive institution is
the Animal Medical Center, and if you were
to spend an hour or so there you would be
struck by two things: the incredible dedica-
tion of the hospital’s staff to the care of its
patients (and their owners), and the almost
equally incredible affection of the owners
for their pets—and for the hospital’s staff.

Let’s assume that you’re a New Yorker
and you discover your pet is in immediate
need of a veterinarian. It is late Saturday
evening on a holiday weekend. You grab a
cab and head for the Center. As you arrive,
you walk into the first floor reception area,
give one of the women on duty your name,
and by the time you get to the second floor
clinic they’re ready for you. In fact, they’re
ready for you 24 hours a day, every day of
the year. If you arrive after midnight, the
downstairs area will be closed, but all you
do is ring the bell and an aide will come
down to admit you—and, if necessary,
bring a stretcher for your pet.

But suppose your animal is not an emer-
gency case; you merely want to check on an
eye infection. You call and make an ap-
pointment—say, for 11 o’clock on a
Wednesday morning. At that hour the clinic
is likely to resemble a cross between a pet
shop and a menagerie. As you walk in, you
notice perhaps thirty owners sitting with
their pets awaiting their doctors. After
checking in and receiving your pet’s ID
card, you join the group—and what a group
it is. Not only are there'cats and dogs of all
descriptions, but you may also find squir-
rels, lizards, monkeys, snakes and an odd
hermit crab. You might even meet Scara-
mouche, an 18-year-old honey bear who
drives his own battery-powered miniature
Rolls-Royce and whose owner brings him in
regularly to have his claws trimmed.

How did this great institution—with its
widely varied clientele—come into being?

The Center was founded in 1910, when
the New York Women’s League for Ani-
mals, under the leadership of Mrs. James
(Ellin Prince) Speyer, set up a dispensary
for pets and work animals on Lafayette
Street in lower Manhattan. A few years lat-
er its first hospital was built, and after
Mrs. Speyer’s death was named for her.

In the 1950s, the Speyer Hospital re-
ceived two large grants from the estate of
Alfred Caspary, whose wife Margaret had
been a member of the League from 1924
and the League’s director from 1926 until
her death in 1952. The funds were intended
to create an animal hospital with services to
rival those of the best hospitals for hu-
mans. The plans included facilities for the
study of animal diseases—particularly
those that threaten both animal and human

 

  

life—and the creatid'n of a post-graduate
teaching hospital for veterinarians.

In 1961, the Animal Medical Center, a
nine-story, modern structure combining the
facilities of the Speyer Hospital and the Ca-
spary Research Institute, was built on its
present site. Today the Center has fifty-five
doctors, a support staff of nearly 200, and a
case load of more than 65,000 patient visits
annually, making it by far the largest ani-
mal hospital in the world.

Some of those who can tell us what
makes the AMC so great are the ones en-
gaged in its management, its medical and
research procedures, its treatment of pa-
tients, and its relations with the public. Un-
fortunately, the one group that could best
enlighten us on the subject—the patients
themselves—can’t say a thing. But their
owners are certainly able to.

ere, for example, is what one happy
pet owner, Leslie Von Karakas,
found when she unexpectedly had oc-
casion to visit the AMC. Some years ago,
before she had ever heard of the Center,
Miss Karakas was taking her four-month-
old Scottish terrier, Fergus, for a picnic in

_ Central Park. She was looking for a likely

spot to settle down when she noticed Fer-
gus had his nose buried in an overturned
tree stump. Suddenly he was attacked by a
swarm of wasps, and Leslie was trying to
swat them off. “The next thing I knew,”
she said, “Fergus looked as though he were
going into a coma. I started frantically call-
ing veterinarians. Of course, no one was
available on a Sunday afternoon. Even the
ASPCA didn’t have emergency service at
that time. So I called a. cab and asked the
driver if he had any suggestions. Fortu-
nately, he knew of the Animal Medical Cen-
ter. When we got there, they rushed us
upstairs. Fergus was examined immediate-
ly and found to be O.K.

‘ “But that was not my last experience
with Fergus and the Center. About two
years ago, I had him in the park, and he had
a sudden attack of vomiting and diarrhea. I
rushed him over to the hospital, and a sam-
ple of his blood was taken to a fabulous ma—
chine that analyzes its complete chemical
profile. Within a matter of hours they
found that Fergus had a complicated and
acute kidney disease. A biopsy was done,
which further pinpointed the problem so
that proper treatment could be started. For
the past year his blood has been completely
normal. I am sure, though, that if it had not
been for the quality of the Center’s doctors
and equipment, Fergus would have died.”

Paul A. Cameron, president of Purolator,
Inc., and the current president of the
Center’s board of trustees, gives its
founders high marks for excellence—as
well as for a pervading spirit of humanitar-
ianism. “Ellin Speyer and her friends real-
ized that animals cannot Speak for
themselves, and they chose to be earthly
spokesmen,” he explained. “The first part
of philanthropy is the giving of yourself,

  




and the second is giving of your net worth.
Those early founders did both, and fortu-
nately today, others like Mrs. Walter Roth-
schild, our board chairman, are carrying on
the tradition.”

Paul Cameron and Mrs. Rothschild are
not alone. The present board of trustees
consists of eighteen other equally dedicated
people, among them Mrs. Walter Hoving,
Cynthia Phipps, Elizabeth Remsen, Mrs.
Eben W. Pyne, Mrs. Taggart Whipple, Mrs.
Joseph Thomas, Charles W. Nichols, Jr.,
Philip W. Farley, Dr. Norman Orentreich
and Charles Simon.

One member of the Center’s staff, Dr.
Richard Greene, a general surgeon, has been
at the hospital fourteen years, and his reason
for staying attests to the excellence of the
Center. “It’s a fascinating place,” he says.
“You never stop learning. The diseases we
treat often are very similar to those in hu-
mans. We are always looking for parallels
to human medicine so that we can benefit
both animals and man. And, in animal sur-
gery, you cannot avoid cancer. What makes
it so complicated is that there is no one spe-
cific disease. Cancer is a very broad term.”

Cancer is probably the most feared dis-
ease in the world today, and although many
millions have been spent in the fight
against it, it remains a serious and baffling
problem. But as we shall learn from Dr. E.
Gregory MacEwen, head of the Center’s
Donaldson-Atwood Cancer Clinic, progress
is being made. In fact, what the Clinic has
accomplished may well turn out to be as
significant as any effort by any organiza-
tion in the field. Much of the Clinic’s work
has been conducted in collaboration with
the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Cen-
ter, which, over the years, has established
itself as one of the world’s leading cancer
research facilities. Dr. MacEwen explains
some of the work of the Clinic:

“Our emphasis has been on trying to
stimulate the body’s defenses to fight can—
cer. Dogs and cats develop cancer about the
same as humans do. They live in similar en-
vironments, are exposed to similar environ-
mental factors, and develop similar
cancers. That’s why we believe the dog may
be a valuable model for the study and man-
agement of breast cancer in humans, for
example, and why we feel there is much
promise in studying the immune response
to cancer in canines.

“Among the most significant work corv-
ducted at the Clinic is its studies in leuke
mia. When two Scottish veterinarians, the
Jarrett brothers, detected what they
thought might be the presence of a virus in
a study of leukemia in cats, they contacted
Dr. William Hardy Jr. at Sloan-Kettering.
He, in turn, called in the AMC, as well as
researchers from the Angel] Memorial Ani-

mal Hospital in Boston.

“We found that not only is leukemia a vi-
rus in cats, but that it is transmittable,” Dr.
MacEwen continues. “More importantly,
the group found that by testing a cat’s
blood, we can tell whether it has the virus.
Although a vaccine has been developed to
counteract it, it is still too early to tell
whether it can be effective over a period of
years. But if it proves to be, and if it can be
determined that there is a Virus which
causes the disease in humans, we will have
gone a long way toward bringing leukemia
under control.”

The Center’s reputation for success in
managing animal cancers is supported by
scores of grateful pet owners who learned
first-hand how calamitous the disease can
be, and how difficult it is to identify and
treat properly. Spencer is just one case.

In 1975, Spencer, a six—year-old Dutch
rabbit, took ill. Once a lively and healthy
apartment pet, she began to lose weight
alarmingly. Her mistress took her to a local
veterinarian, who diagnosed a virus and
prescribed an antibiotic. The medication
didn’t work, and finally Spencer’s owner
brought her into the Animal Medical Cen-
ter. X-rays were taken immediately, Spen-
cer was operated on within hours, and it
was found that she had cancer of the uter-
us, which was removed. Though there were
a few postoperative complications, for
which she returned for additional treat-
ment, Spencer celebrated her tenth birth-
day, as fat and lively as ever.

The detection and removal of Spencer’s
tumor, like the care of many of the Center’s
patients, required a team effort—a nurse, a
resident doctor, an X-ray technician, a pa-
thologist, an anesthetist, and acsurgeon.
This approach to veterinary medical care
reflects the Animal Medical Center’s three—
fold mission, which combines clinical care
with teaching and research.

The AMC’s education programs were es-
tablished in 1964. Each year the Center ac-
cepts candidates for nineteen—month
internships, two-year residencies in medi—
cine and surgery, and three-year residen-
cies in pathology. These programs are
voluntary—unlike medical school gradu-
ates who deal with humans, veterinary
school graduates are not required to take
internships before going into practice—but
because of the Center’s reputation, compe-
tition for these positions is intense. Each
year the center must reject many more can—
didates than it can accept.

In addition to its programs for-the study
of cancer, the Animal Medical Center is
emerging as a national center for veteri-
nary research in a number of areas. The
AMC has produced major work on inherited
metabolic disorders, heart disease, bone

plating techniques in orthopedic surgery,
the use of fiber optics in biopsies, epilepsy,
cryosurgery (freezing of diseased or dam-
aged tissues), and veterinary applications
of equipment and techniques used in hu-
man medicine. The Center also performs ef-
ficacy studies for major pharmaceutical
andmedical and surgical supply firms, as
well as for the federal government.

And all this has been accomplished with-
out any induced disease or injury to any
animal. The philosophy of the Center is to
study and treat disease only as it occurs
naturally, and it is a philosophy that is
strictly adhered to.

As with cancer, so is heart disease a
problem in animals, and a significant num—
ber of cases come to the AMC. Dr. Betsy
Bond, an assistant staff member in cardi-
ology, explains that 85 percent of these car-
diology cases involve valvular disease in
older dogs. “Through treatment with diga-
talis and diuretics,” she says, “we can give
them sometimes two or three more years of
life. I’ve had people come back and say to
me ‘my dog is like a puppy again.’ _We get
really dramatic results, but, of course the
animals are on medication for the rest of
their lives.

“In young dogs there are congenital
heart defects, things that they are born
with. In many cases we can correct these
defects surgically, and if the problem is cor-
rected early enough, the dog can go on to
live a normal life.”

Dr. Bond came to the Center as an intern,
and one thing the layman learns from her is
that interns are nothing if not gung-ho.

“We have what we call the double shift. It
starts at five in the afternoon and goes on
till midnight. Interns work two double
shifts one week and one the next. And that
is after a full day. The latest I was here
during my internship was 3:30 A.M. A dog
was brought in at midnight for emergency
surgery, and I didn’t feel right leaving the
surgeon alone with the dog. So I scrubbed
up and assisted him.”

One thing that doctors find most diffi-
cult—more than a heavy case load or an ex-
tremely complicated operation—is dealing
with a pet’s owner. As Dr. Richard Johnson
puts it, “People are occasionally offended
at the Center because they don’t get the at-
tention they get from their private vet. For
example, someone will bring in an animal at
night for surgery, and I will take over,
though the person has never met me. The
next day they will call and ask why they
can’t deal with the individual they met and
liked. They don’t understand that with us,
the animal comes first. The animals here
get the best care anywhere in the country.
But if I have to spend a lot of time talking
to owners, I can’t do my job.”

 




 

Other problems arise when the owner
wants to visit his sick pet. “In human hospi-
tals you can go in and see a patient,” ex-
plains Dr. Johnson. “Not here. There’s a lot
of supporting care taking place, so you
can’t just stop it to bring the animal out for
the owner to see it. If the animal is brought
out, it gets excited and thinks it’s going
home; it causes additional stress, and what
the animal really needs is complete rest.
We can’t ignore the owner, and we don’t
want to, but sometimes it presents a diffi-
cult situation.”

Although the majority of cases at the
Center involve cats or dogs, doctors some-
times get some rather exotic animals, as
Sandra Manfra, a resident surgeon discov-
ered when an owner brought in his iguana.

“He had dropped it,” Dr. Manfra recalled,
“and it had fractured its arm. We put a pin
in the arm and used wires to hold the frac-
ture together. The fracture, though, was
not the hard part of the operation. It was
the anesthesia. The plane of anesthesia is
very sensitive in animals, and you have to
be very careful not to give too little or too
much. The slightest overdose can be fatal.
But the iguana is fine, though the sutures
will have to stay in for about a month. They
don’t heal nearly as fast as other animals.”

So whether it is an iguana, a hermit crab,
or even a honey bear, you meet the most in-
teresting patients at the Center.

The treatment of these patients, howev-
er, is not always confined to medical prob—
lems. Research at the Animal Medical
Center reaches out in other directions as
well. Dr. Peter Borchelt and his colleague,
Dr. Daniel Tortora, are not veterinarians.
Both have Ph.D.s in comparative psycholo-
gy. What they are doing, as Dr. Borchelt
puts it, is “practically inventing a whole
new set of procedures for dealing with pet
behavior.”

 

Malcolm Ripley, president of the New
York State Humane Association presents

the board of trustees of the Animal Medi-
cal Center, with a plaque for her fifty
years of meritorious service to the ani-
mals in New York State.

Borchelt goes on to describe a typical
case. “Someone will come in with a statement:
‘My dog is barking, and it bites me every so
often.’ Now that gives us a general idea of
what the problem is, but what we need to
know are specifics—exactly what the dog
does under a variety of circumstances,
what the owner does in response to the dog
under each of those circumstances, and
what the dog does in response to the owner.

“Very often, owners will attempt to pun-
ish a behavior problem. That can lead to
other problems. There are many ways to
punish inappropriately and only a few right
ones. If the average person tries to repair a
computer, it usually ends up running back-
ward. So it is with punishment of animals.
And with reward as well.

“This field is so new there are only ten or
fifteen people in the country who are quali-
fied to practice. Basically, it is the applica-
tion of animal learning and behavior
modification to pet behavior problems.

“Our best clients are sometimes those
who can least afford the individual training
courses we give on animal behavior. But
these pet owners are highly motivated, and
they work very hard. The better the pet
gets, the better they themselves feel. So
this treatment of the pet is self-rewarding.”

Dr. Borchelt believes that the informa-
tion they have obtained eventually can be
applied to human behavior. “We’ve had a
number of cases where a parent will punish
both their pet and their child the same
way,” he says. “If having pointed out that
the punishment technique they are using on
the animal is totally ineffective, we were to
tell them that it is equally ineffective with
the child, they might feel threatened. But
we do see patterns emerging from prob-
lems with both pets and people.”

Katherine Rule is involved in the well-be-
ing of animals in yet another way. Al—
though she is not a doctor, her function at
the Center is vital. Her official title is su—
pervisor, preparatory operating and recov-
ery area, and in this capacity she oversees
eleven technicians. Among many other du-
ties, their jobs are to prepare the animals
for surgery, assist the doctors in anesthe-
tizing the animal, hold limbs in the proper
position for plaster casts, and position the
animal for surgery.

Like all her colleagues, Katherine Rule
loves her work; but unlike most, she has no
desire to be a veterinarian. As she puts it,
“I think you can do just as worthwhile a job
being an animal nurse. It is just like nurs—
ing in the human profession. The animals
have the same characteristics as people. You
get nervous people who are very uptight
about doctors, and you get animals who are
just the same. Each animal is an individual.
Some are very friendly, bubbling all over,

M

some are very reserved, and some are very
cross, ready to snap your fingers off. So
one of the most important aspects of any
job in this hospital is the handling of ani-
mals. If we can handle an animal well, we
are halfway there. If someone is excitable,
it transmits to the animals. And since sur-
gery is a very hectic area with all its emer-
gencies, we have to have people who can
talk calmly to the animal and get it to relax.”

Katherine is very happy to be an animal
nurse, but she would not want to make a
profession of nursing people. “I think peo-
ple are very difficult to deal with when they
are sick,” she says, “but animals are very
grateful for the care they receive.”

Like Katherine Rule, Mark Benveniste is
neither a doctor nor a veterinary student.
But his job is also one of the most impor-
tant in the Center, for it is he and his staff
who deal most directly with the owners of
animals that are brought in for treatment.

“We have a tremendous number of elder-
ly persons who come in here,” he says,
“and sometimes the animal is the only
member of their family with whom they
have a close relationship. So not only are
we treating the animal but many times the
client as well. It is very rewarding, though
at time it does get to you. How do you tell
an elderly persorf that it is best that their
animal, who might have been with them for
fifteen years, be put to sleep? Suddenly
your relationship changes from an adult
talking to another adult to a parent trying
to comfort a child. And each person is dif-
ferent. We can’t talk to a 75—year-old the
same way we do a 25-year—old.

“The most difficult situations are those
when an owner brings in an animal that has
been injured or is dead. We had an elderly
gentleman, a man in his seventies, who fell
out of the cab as he was bringing his dog
in. Both his knees were bleeding badly, but
he refused to go up the street to the New
York Hospital for treatment until we had
checked out his animal. Nothing we could
say would convince him until the dog was
sent to be X-rayed. Fortunately, the dog
was all right; but as soon as the gentleman
was treated, he came back to take it home.

“When an animal dies, you have even
more Violent reactions. Some people faint,
some break down in tears, and some just sit
and rock. And when you have a busy clinic,
with thirty or forty clients waiting for their
animals to be seen by a vet, things can get
a bit chaotic.” This is why the Center, and
more importantly, its clients, are so fortu-

nate to have people of the caliber of Mark
Benveniste and his staff to help them.

But to get the best overall picture of the
importance of the Center and its workings,
Dr. William Kay, the hospital’s chief of

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

staff, is the logical spokesman. He is one of
the nation’s leading veterinary neurolo-
gists, and listening to him is one way of
learning where veterinary medicine may be
going in the next ten or fifteen years.

“In 1977,” says Dr. Kay, “about 33 per-
cent of all applicants to medical schools
were accepted. During that same year, only
about twelve percent were admitted to
American veterinary colleges. One would
assume that a profession this attractive
must have something going for it.

“That something, I think, is the quality
of the work involved. I would say that most
of the staff at the AMC have a high sense
of purpose in terms of what their profes-
sion means to them. We’ve been very fortu-
nate to get the cream of the crop because
the Center has such sophisticated equip-
ment and is so unique in its teaching con-
cepts that people from all over the world
apply to come here and train.”

If you are wondering by now why there is
not an institution like the Animal Medical Cen-
ter in every large metropolitan center, Dr.
Kay offers some interesting insights into the
cost of excellence in animal health care.

“To put together an establishment of this
kind,” he says, “you have to be prepared to
lose money. You can put together a con-
cept, but you cannot run an organization
like this without resources other than fees
for professional services. Even with dona-
tions and grants from individuals, founda-
tions and corporations, we still end up in
the red. We could not treat pets consistent-
ly, with the quality of equipment and man-
power we have, for the fees we’re charging
clients alone. And we receive no govern-
ment financing, either local, state or feder-
al. But we are finding that, as veterinary
medicine (like medicine in general) becomes

more sophisticated, the cost of the technol-
ogy is simply outdistancing the public’s
ability to pay.

“Veterinary medical costs still have a
way to go before they become prohibitive,
but efforts are being made to find some al-
ternatives to ever increasing fees. Insur-
ance might be the answer. But there have
been numerous plans developed to have a
third party reimbursement of some type for
pet treatment, and as of today, none of
them have made it. The major problem is
that there are no actuarial figures on what
pet diseases cost, based on the sophistica-
tion of the treatment.

“The care of animals is indeed sophisti-
cated, and traditional lines between ‘ani-
mal’ medicine and ‘human’ medicine are
becoming less distinct in many areas of

treatment and research.”

Dr. Kay points out that the importance of
medical research in animals as it relates to
the health of humans touches many areas.
“For example,” he notes, “a disease in cats
called cardiomyopathy, which means heart
muscle disease, is very similar to one of the
heart conditions found in man. For many
years it was not known that cats got heart
disease, but thanks to our collaborative pro-
gram with Columbia Presbyterian, we have
done clinical research that shows that not
only do they get it, but there may well be a
commonality of causes in the disease be-
tween cats and humans. And that knowl—
edge puts us that much closer to
controlling it.”

But what of the future direction of veter-
inary medicine? Dr. Kay gives us some pro—
jections.

“Like man’s preoccupation with his
health and well-being in the late twentieth
century,” he says, “concern is expanding

beyond the physical to encompass the emo-
tional and psychological as well.

“One aspect of veterinary medicine that
we are beginning to explore, and one that
we consider most important, has almost
nothing to do with the animal itself. It has
to do with human suffering.

“I’ve seen sick animals pull families
apart. One member of the family wants one
thing, another wants something else. It is
destructive, and has even caused divorce.

“You see, to one person the statement, ‘I
think we ought to put your dog to sleep,
Mrs. Smith, since he has an incurable heart
disease,’ is exactly what she wants to hear.
She doesn’t want to solve the emotional
problem herself and is relieved that we
have done it for her. But say the same
thing to the next person, and you’ll find
yourself confronting outrage, if not hyste-
ria. Pets mean a great deal to people, cer-
tainly more than inanimate things, and
sometimes even more than other people.
It’s a problem we must learn more about.”

Dr. Kay believes that, over the long
term, the Animal Medical Center has ac-
complished a great deal of good—not only
in a scientific sense, but in making people
feel better.

“After all,” he observes, “we are the
court of last resort, an institution where
owners of pets expect the very best in ev-
ery department. So it is our job to see to it
that they get it.

“Thanks to a great staff, a dedicated
board of trustees, and generous donations
from people of all walks of life, we are the
best and hope to become even better.”

Pet owners continue to flock to the Ani-
mal Medical Center—and, in the final anal-
ysis, many of them would, in times of their
own sickness, gladly trade places with their
pets. Cl

Two headlines together carry a
message about where the world is
going. The first: “Continuing Mexi-
can Oil Spill Baffles Industry Ex-
perts.” And the second:
Chief Favors East Coast Oil Refin—
ery . . . Fought by Environmenta-
lists.”

It is four months since that well in
the Gulf of Mexico blew out. Mexi-
co’s state oil company has used its
own technicians and foreign experts
to try to stop the flow, spending mil-
lions in the attempt. But 10,000 bar-
rels of oil are still gushing out of
those broken pipes every day.

The Mexican disaster illustrates a
phenomenon of contemporary life:
The technology of exploitation has
'iraced . ahead of the technology of
control. We have invented a thou-

‘ ’ , sand ways to exploit the earth and

release its natural forces. But we
.are not masters of the processes we

I 1 have crea t.ed

The risks are great, and we know
that But economic forces press us
on. In the hope of short-term benefits
we risk long-term damage that we
do not know how to prevent.

The refinery approved the other
dayby the secretary of the army,
Clifford L. Alexander, would be built
where the Elizabeth River joins the
_ Chesapeake Bay, in Portsmouth,
Va. The Chesapeake Bay is rich in
blue crabs and oysters, and many
varities of fish spawn in the bay and
its tributaries. _

, Modern technology has already
,done fearful damage to the waters of
the Chesapeake. The manufacture of
Kepone dumped chemical poison
into the James River before it was
stopped. All fishing had to be banned
in that area, and no practical quick

way was found to remove the accu-

* 1- mulated chemical residue.
. , In approving the new oil refinery,
Alexander said it would meet “state-
of-the-art standards” for environ-
mental safeguards. No doubt it
, would. The problem is the state of
" the art.

“The environment,” as a phrase
has nowadays joined the category of
fighting words. Those who want to
protect it face a hardhat argument
that they are elitists concerned more
with esthetics than necessity.

In fact, the human longing for nat-
ural beauty is not confined to any
elite; we nearly all respond to the
curve of a beach or the lift of a
mountain. But in protecting the envi-

ronment we care for other funda- 1.

ample of danger is the plan to drill
for oil in Georges Bank, the richest

Dear Mr. Mitchell,

I had earlier eent you the six meet recent issues of the enimal
welfare Institute' 5 "Information Report“ which goes out to all
members on a quarterly basis. You have permission to quote from
them.

The Institute was set up to disseminate information about animals
and has a very wide range. As our name indicates, we are interesteé
in the welfare of all kinds of animals everywhere, from laboratory

animals to farm animals to wild birds to whales.

we started out as a small group epecifically designed to further”
the cause of humane treatment for laboratory animals at a time ‘
when all existing groups were either indiscriminately pro~ or anti~
vivieection. Our newsletter has always reflected a spare, dedicated,
hardwhitting approach.

Over the years we have become more and more aware of the value of
interesting, varied writing and eye~catching photograohe. and we
have started to be what could be described ae modee1ly zippy. I'm
enclosing some earlier “Information Reports" to give you an idea of
the savage battles we ve been through and of how far we have come.
Enclosed also are an information sheet on the background and
achievements of the Institute, and one of its companion organization,
The Society for Animal Protective Legislation.

Sincerely,

John Gleiber

Gentlemen: ;
appalling plight

I have just recently learned about the/of the little dairy bull
calveslwhich are sold under the label of "milk fed veal”. I am told there was
an article on this in the New York Magazine last fall but have not been able
to get ahold of it yet. The TV program "Those Amazing Animals" did a feature
on it recently but I felt it was much too watered down. It must be one of the
best kept secrets in America. I am a country girl and up until recently, I had
never heard of such a practice. What can we do about it?

I was so shocked by it and everyone I have mentioned it to feels the
same way and their reaction is always the same ”I'll never buy another pound of
veal" and therein, I think, could lie the answer. To tell the public how this
meat is come by might be the strongest weapon we have.

The way chickens are produced en masse is another ugly story on the Ameri-
can scene. Are these weird practices results of animal research in agriculture
schools? Could something be done there?

Dog fighting is another well kept secret in this country that literally
tears me apart. Dogs have been my beloved companions all my life and I, for one,
would like to see the dogs turn on the men who promote this vicious business and

give them a dose of their own medicine.

These things are hard to fight but I believe most people are basically

kind - but mostly ignorant of what goes on behind the scenes. I think a good

airing of the above atrocities would be the most effective way to fight it and

enlist the help of the general public to flush out and report suspects.

 




v

This has certainly been a year of animal oriented TV programs and I
would like to see the momentum kept up through programs like "Those Amazing
Animals”, the James Herriott stories and elsewhere where animals have appeared.
Does the APS have money for television programs or could they create campaigns
to raise it. It is by far the most powerful and effective tool we have.

Another way might be to have a column in local papers or even a syndicated
column dealing with animals. Such a space could be used in so many ways and I
think the peOple who own and love animals would find it intensely interesting
if handled right.

You may be wondering why you are getting this letter from me...

For several years now I have been crucified by what I have seen happening
to animals where I couldn't do anything about it or not much. VOr when I hear
about something like the veal calves or dog fighting. I finally decided that maybe
I would be easier in my mind if I got into the fight and tried to do something
about it.

So I am trying to learn as much as I can and share with you any ideas.

Just want to say one more thing. In order to bring social pressure on
the parties involved in cruelty to animals, you've got to hit peOple where they
live and get them aroused. Lukewarm, watered down accounts are just not effeCtive.

who -

One of my pet peeves: the adults let their female dogs have puppies so their
children can learn about birth. I say, they should also let their children see

those puppies die when they end up in a shelter, or worse, because nobody wants

them.
I will be very interested to learn more about what is being done in this

work and what the individual can do to help.

Sincerely yours

I have sent this same letter to the Humane Society Office in Washington.

Would like to add that since I typed the letter, called the Managing Editor
of our local newspaper and they are interested in providing a space.

By way of background material, might add that I have owned and shown horses
most of my life and am now showing dogs. So animals are not new to me.

Dear Ms. Tyrrell

I am writing an article for publication concerning
the theft and slaughter of pet dogs for profit.

The thrust of this effort is based on a report that
the leather garment manufacturing industry is turning
to dog hides as an alternative to scarce and expensive
animal pelts. The skins of pet dogs are said to be prev
ferred over street dogs because the skins of pet dogs are
usually healthy and unblemished.

I also desire to touch upon vivisection from the
steal-for-profit point of view.

If you have knowvledge of these matters your assist-
ance is earnestly solicited. Of particular interest are

resulting manuscript, you will be credited for your con-
tribution.

This is so important and makes such modest demands in terms of

Dear Ms Stevens;
This does not require an answer.

I just wish to share with you a disturbing statement
by Anna La Bastille in her auto biographical "Assignment:
‘Wildlife”, page 223:

(Instead of cutting down and burning rain forest to change
land into marginal fields) ... utilize existing fish
and wildlife.

"With proper management there can be game cropping and
aquaculture of animals such as the manatee (which is
more nutritious than beef) tapir, agouti, capybara,
turtles (the soucalled cattle of the Amazon), and nutria.

"Surplus number of primates, caimans and trOpical fish
could be exported for medical research, leather and pet
shops."

Miss La Bastille is well educated, smart and a
compassionate person. I cannot believe she knows the
dark sides of factory farming sea animals, the poor
survival rate of shipped animals, their fate in pet
shops, and the meaning behind words "medical research"
from the point of View of the victims.

INSIHIJBIIIIE
BREAKIHHHIIEII

by Liam Brophy

 

 

 

 

Animal lovers and protectors are often rashly and
illogically accused of being enemies of the human race.

 

The evils of vivisection
have become possible largely
because animals have come
to be regarded as things rather
than as sentient beings and
fellow-creatures. For an in-
calculable period of time man,
through the misapplication
of his own rational powers,
has allowed himself to be-
come exiled from nature, al-
ienated from the tremendous,
close-Woven processes of all
life, and that creation with
which our ancestors lived on
terms of uninhibited famil-
iarity. Wordsworth well said:
‘ “We lay waste our powers,
little we see in Nature that is
ours; we have given our hearts
away, a sordid boon!”

Candid scientists have
come to see and confess that
we have paid a high price for
“the sordid boon.” Thus
Bleibtreu, in his book The
Parable of the Beast says:
“This armor we wear -— the
armor of technology separat-
ing us from the rest of the nat—
ural world —— has created us
lately in the condition of ex-
iles . . . We have lately dis-
covered that there are forces
abroad in our world to which
animals respond. At one time
or another in our evolution-
ary history, we too re-
sponded to these forces. They
now remain almost vestigial

. This new mythology
which is being derived from
the most painstaking re-
search into other animals,
their sensations and behav-
iour, is an attempt to re-es-
tablish our losses —— to place
ourselves anew within the
order of things, because faith
in an order is a requirement
of life.” Henry David Tho-
reau was one of those rare
and gifted individuals who
re-established man’s lost in—
timacy with animals, and
learned from close experi-
ence much about animal per-
ception and behaviour more
than a century before modern
biologists.

It has been discovered of
late that animals use radar,
electric shock-waves and
early warning devices; that
they “see” electric fields, ul-
tra-violet and polarized light;
that they “hear” images, smell
things miles away, sense
earthquakes in advance, pro—
duce cries man cannot hear
and navigate by the sun and
stars. It has also been dis-
covered that in some animal
Paradises unvisited by man,
animals have not learned to
fear him or tremble at his ap-
proach. Thoreau discovered
how animals, with their mys-
terious intercom system,
spread around the tidings that

a human friend had come
among them.

How true the reverse is can
be illustrated from an inci-
dent related in H. A. Page’s
introduction to a biography
of Thoreau: “We read not long
ago in the account of a trav-
eller-naturalist, that in some
of the primeval forests of the
South, rare birds, undis-
turbed, eyed him inquir-
ingly, without fear, when he
was within a yard of the
branches where they sat, ‘til,
smitten with the scientific
passion for specimens, he
knocked some of them down
with a stick. But after re-
peated recourse to the stick,
we are assured that, though
our traveller-naturalist wan-
dered far and wide in these
almost boundless forests, no
more was he allowed to ap-
proach the birds he most
sought to reach. It was as
though telegrams of misery
and fear had in some un-
known tongue been sent forth
in all directions. The advent
of man had become an omen
of evil, and of evil alone.”

There is, fortunately, a dif-
ferent approach to animals in
our time: the camera and
notebook have replaced the
snare and gun to a large ex-
tent, and instead of studying
them in the artificial envi-

 




ronment of the zoo, biolo-
gists visit and study them in
their native habitats.

It might be truthfully said
that Thoreau was a trailbla-
zer to the better understand-
ing of animals, and by his
sympathy, kindness of heart,
and that deep intuition,
which is akin to endowed in—
spiration, anticipated the
methods of that great ethnol-
ogist, the Baltic Baron, Jacob
Johann von Uekiill and the
Viennese zoologist, Konrad
Zachasias Lorens.

A friend close to Thoreau
recorded that his intimacy
with animalssuggested what
Thomas Fuller noted of But-
ler, the apologist, that “either
he had told the bees things,
or the bees had told him.”
The same friend vouched for
it that snakes coiled ’round
his legs, fish swam into his
hand as he took them out of
the water, that he pulled the
woodchuck out of its hole by
the tail, and took the foxes
under his protection from the
hunters.

Another contemporary re-
ported of him that he never
used a weapon in his mature
years. He neither killed nor
imprisoned any animal, un-
less driven by very acute ne-
cessity. He brought home a
flying squirrel in order to
study its mode of flight, and
that done, carried it back to
the woods. He possessed an
abnormal sense of topogra-
phy, and could conceal things
in the bush and find them
again after long intervals.
“Nothing afforded him more
delight than to observe the
graceful prudence of ani-
mals. The shifts to which he
had so often put to himself to
achieve t ' nowledge
wit cruelty, perhaps, did
more than aught else to de-
velop in him his wonderful
half-animal sagacity.”

Animal lovers and protec-
tors are often rashly and il-
logically accused of being
enemies of the human race
under the banner of “odi pro-
fanum vulgus,” that they flee
humanity as monks are sup-
posed to do, and that they are
self-centered misanthropes at
best. We may point to Tho-
reau as a supreme example of
an animal lover totally free of
these alleged faults. He re-
tired from the world to Wal-
den, as we know, for the space
of two years and two months,
with the very laudable desire
of shaking off the artificial
checks which a technical civ-
ilization put between him and
the fullness of life with na-
ture. The experiment some-
what resembled the “survival
schools” for downed airmen,
deprived ’of all the props of
civilization, and compelled
to exist and survive in a world
which their primitive ances-
tors found sustaining for
many millions of years. It in-
volves closer co-operation
with natural forces than
learning how to light a fire
without matches.

During this period of ex-
periment, Thoreau contin-
ued to enjoy the friendship of
gifted men who sympathized
with his ideals, among them
the supreme essayist and
Transcendentalist, Emerson.
That great writer, though a
sensitive and observant lover
of nature himself, was as—
tounded at Thoreau’s pow-
ers. It was as though man’s
dominion had never broken
nature’s social union in his
case. He described the in—
tense delight of nature walks
with Thoreau, and he was a
man who loved to share his
enthusiasm with others: “Our
naturalist had perfect mag-
nanimity; he had no secrets;
he would carry you to the
heron’s haunt, or even to his

most prized botanical swamp
—— possibly knowing that you
could never find it again, yet
willing to take the risk . . . He
could find his way in the
woods at night better by his
feet than by his eyes. He knew
every track in the snow and
on the ground, and what
creature had taken the path
in the snow before him.”

Long after he returned to
Concord, Thoreau explained
to his friends with delight
how the wild birds had ceased
to be afraid of him, and how
they would come to perch on
his shoulder and even on his
spade when he was digging.
He was proud to regard it as
a sign that he was received
and accepted into the animal
kingdom.

Another matter in which
he anticipated animal re-
search was his belief in the
individuality of animals. Most
of us are familiar with the
fact that our pets have per-
sonalities, but it has been
found that this individuality
extends to all other animals
as well. He noted the stupid
and cruel ways in which an-
imals were treated, the habit
of mind which regards them
as things as if they had not
the feelings and character of
individual being — a habit
which, as we have insisted so
often, leads to the callous evils
of vivisection. Indeed, he
opened the way for discus-
sion on the instincts of ani-
mals, preferring to see them
as forms of wisdom and in-
telligence. The growing
number of opponents of Be—
haviourism and Pavlovian
experimentation might be in-
terested in developing Tho-
reau’s approach. We would
surely come to a better un-
derstanding of animals by re-
garding them as rudimentary
men, as Thoreau did, rather

than as bundles of condi-
tioned reflexes as identical as

sembly line.

We cannot but regret that
Thoreau returned to the city
of men after a mere two years
and two months in his woods,
when he believed he had fully
served his purpose. His father
died shortly after his return,
and to support the family he
took up the family business
of pencil-making, at which
he proved very successful,
for he was one of those men
who bring to perfection

whatever they feel to be their
duty to others, including an—
imals.

He did not abandon his
contacts with nature, but or-
ganized excursions into the
country, alone or with a party,
into such remote areas as the
White Mountains. It must
truly have been a wonderful
experience to share such ad—
ventures, and walk the earth,
as it were, with a Paradisal
man, somewhat as Adam
must have done before the
Fall.

Perhaps Thoreau got nearer

to the secrets of nature and
gained the confidence of an—
imals because he was essen-
tially a poet, with all the
poet’s delicacy and intuition,
plus a profound reverence for
life. Now that science is com—
ing to have greater respect for
poetry —— its greatest discov-
eries were made by intuition
— it may come to study the
approaches of men like Tho-
reau more closely, and hum-u
bly learn more of the world
in which we live and move
and share our being with all
creatures. I I

Dear Ms. Bemelmans,

I am a cultural anthropologist currently doing research for a book
about the relationship between dogs and people around the world. At the
moment I am focusing on the problems of dogs in twentieth century America.
A section of the book deals with dogs in transit. Recently, I visited the
AnimalPort at J.F.K. in New York and was impressed with the accommodations
and the personnel working there. What I am interested in learning is how
typical this facility is compared with those of other airports around the
country. Are there any statistics regarding dog fatalities during transit,
or on the kinds of conditions which they must face when traveling? Specifically,
can it be shown that the conditions have improved :in I the years following
the Animal Welfare Act?

I am also interested in learning what you consider to be the most
important areas in which we need to improve legislation to ensure the
welfare of dogs in particular. (Please understand that my personal concern
extends to all animals, but for the purposes of this research project I
must limit inquiries to those regarding dogs.) I assume these would include
dogfighting and the use of dogs in laboratory experimentation, but perhaps
there are other legislative battles being fought of whihh I am as yet unaware.
Any information, literature, statistics, -- and also past newsletters -—
that deal with dog welfare or the need for_more protective legislation, will
be deeply appreciated. (Please bill me for the postage if it is excessive).
And please add my name to your regular mailing list.

Thank you very much in advance for your valuable time and consideration.
I am very grateful for both. Looking forward to hearing frmm you soon, I remain

Very sincerely yours,

Dear Vic:

Thank you for the Iiterature that you encTosed with the review. Both wiTI
be usefuI.

I have read your review, and don't find any major probIems with the factuaI
information. I shouId Iike to make onTy a few comments for your consideration.

In the first paragraph, it appears to me that the statement ”It may, or may not,
kiIIother mammaIs which it attacks." may be somewhat misIeading, since aTT Tisted
excepting bats, seem aImost invariany to be kiIIed.

In the same paragraph, with reference to naturaITy-occurring, neutraIizing anti—
bodies, some modification is probabTy required. It is true that such antibodies
are sometimes detected, but they aIso have been found in animaIs which have never
had contact with the virus of rabies. In a recent review by MandeIer (1980),
this situation has been discussed. The few pages of interest have been copied
and encIosed for your use.

Unfortunater, the situation with respect to the age—composition of populations
of foxes over severaI years where the virus is endemic is not understood. In
AIaska, incIuding St. Lawrence IsIand, we obtained rabid arctic foxes aimost
annuaIIy over about 25 years (perhaps no records during 2-3 winters, but probabTy
a resuIt of Tack of IocaI interest in the probIem), the major outbreaks during
times of high numericaI density. With red foxes on the AIaska PeninsuIa, two
extensive outbreaks were separated by an lntervaI of about IO years. We have
data not yet summarized which may be of ‘v.erest; we processed foxes at random,
and found quite a number to have recov able virus in the brain. Ages of aII

of these were determined from sectiorx if teeth.

Again, on page 3, para. 2, you mig i want to modify this after reading WandeIer's
materiaI. The probIem is that foxes, at Ieast in the Arctic and Subarctic, don't
have any opportunity to consume rabid prey unTess they eat carcasses of other foxes
dead of rabies. Such carcasses may be abundant, but I have never seen any evidence
of their being eaten by foxes. I did suggest that brown bears may consume carcasses
of rabid foxes when they first emerge in spring foTIowing an epizootic, but they
require a very Iarge quantity of virus for infection (by injection). There has
been no evidence of rabies in any rodents in North America (occasionaI marmots and
tree squirreIs at Tower Iatitudes excepted). CDC does not even recommend the test-
ing of rodents foIIowing bites. Such rodents made up the majority of theanimaIs
tested by us in AIaska, since we preferred to avoid any risks, but none was ever

 




 

found to be positive for the virus.

On the basis of experimentaI infections, we found that the period of incubation
in arctic foxes may extend to at Ieast 6 months. ConsequentIy, this wouId seem
to account for perpetuation of the virus in a popuIation. AIso, of course,
arctic foxes wander wider. We obtained a rabid animaI from the ice—isIand,
T-3, when it was about 600—700 miIes from Iand.

I have discussed some of these things in a coupIe of puinshed papers. I may
not have any reprints now, but can make copies if these wouId be of interest to
you.

Anyway, I hope that these comments wiII be of some use. NandeIer is a competent
worker, and I beIieve that you can rer on his information. If I can be of
any further assistance, pIease Iet me know.

With regards,

Rabies and Wildlife; a Biologist's Perspective. 1980.

 

David W. Macdonald (Oxford Univ. Press), 151 pp. Paper.
B 3.95 in United Kingdom.

.Rabies is a dreaded viral disease of the nervous system.
In humans, if untreated, it is fatal. It is a special
threat to people in crowded nations such as India, where
it kills about 10,000 yearly. It may, or may not, kill
other mammals Which it attacks. These victims include
cats, dogs, foxes (and many other carnivores), cattle,
deer, and New World bats. Rabid vampire bats in Latin Amer-
ica yearly kill cattle valued at $250 million. In the wild,
rabies epizootics rise and fall in intensity, their cycles

mainly

controlled/by constantly changing ratios of individuals
possessing natural, serum~neutralizing antibodies. A fox
population reduced by/iabies epizootic to one-tenth will
recover in about six years.

Macdonald, a British biologist and Specialist in fox

behavior, focuses on rabies in the fox, for he believes

that the nature of rabies can best be understood if one

studies in depth its effects on a single species or species~group.

He suggests that "any wildlife management problem can and
should be tackled only on the basis of a thorough under—

standing of the behavioural ecology of the species involved."

 




He agrees that rabies is most apt to flare up where

foxes are abundant, yet he concludes that ”mass—killing
[of foxes] has generally not worked." He points to the
success of the Polish method, which is based largely on
biocontrol (the control of life by ‘ life). When rabies
erupts in Poland the authorities kill ailing foxes and
all stray dogs and cats, then let the disease run its
course, that is, limit itself.

In 1952 an attempt was made to stop the southerly
spread of rabies through the province of Alberta. Largely
through the distribution of strychnine and cyanide poisons,
about 50,000 foXes, 100,000 coyotes, 4,300 wolves, 7,500
lynxes, 1,850 bears, 500 skunks, 64 cougars, 4 badgers,
and l wolverine were killed. "There are depressingly
few instances," Macdonald writes,"where the introduction
of such control schemes can unequivocally be said to have
resulted in the eradication of rabies.”

Moreover, in Alberta ”the number of deer and moose
increased greatly after the slaughter of carnivores which
had previously preyed upon them; this resulted in serious
over-grazing and consequent long~term damage to the range,
which reduced its capacity to maintain big game herds."
When poison baits are set against foxes they kill not only
foxes but raptorial birds. What often follows?...fewer
birds, mggg field rodents and (supported by rodent foods)

more foxes:

 




3

Because the rabies Virus persists in wild-animal
reservoirs, man can't hope to eradicate it as he has
eradicated the smallpox virus, although he can soften its
impact. In Britain, however, the virus was wiped out by
1903 as a consequence of laws Which called for vaccination
of all pets, killing stray dogs, and imposition of a strict
national quarantine. (A pet dog smuggled into Plymouth in
1918 started a local epizootic which took three year's
efforts to quell.)

The best hope for rabies control in the future is "to
persuade the foxes to vaccinate themselves." It seems that
foxes will take baits laced with an oral vaccine which
subsequently takes effect either through the mouth or the
intestine. The resulting immunity~~if I rightly understand
it-—resembles the natural immunity developed in young
foxes when they eat rabid prey carrying the virus in its

nonvirulent.stage. Oral vaccine can be dropped from
aircraft at a cost af about six cents per fox-taken bait.

One baiting experiment furnished a curious insight

into fox behavior. Freeze—dried vaccine, stored in beef—

flavored plastic bags, had been hung on trees with little

success. When a sterilized stone was added to each bag, the

acceptance rate jumped from 3 percent to 80 percent. The
over

foxes showed their preference for heavier foods iilighter

ones .

 




 

 

 

"It remains unknown," Macdonald tells us, "whether
vaccine-induced rabies could maintain a chain of infection
in the wild, during Which its initially low Virulence might
be increased."

Macdonald seems a practical sort. In the event that
rabies should return to Britain he would immediately
surround the focus of the epizootic with a fox-killing
zone or cordon~~to thin the population and reduce the
chances of fox-to-fox contact~~and would surround this zone
with another in which foxes would be immunized.

As a fellow biologist I find Macdonald's natural,
holistic approach to rabies control convincing. Rather than
continuing to rely on seek~and~destroy methods, he would
use such biocontrol methods as are now available, meanWhile
seeking to learn all there is to be learned about the

ages—old relationship between a pathogen and its hosts.

By Patricia Curtis

Wide, wild world
of Hope Ryden,
bedroll naturalist

A ﬁerce sense of outrage over the treatment
of wildlife turned a documentary ﬁlm maker

into prizewinning conservationist author

Thai"

In the National Elk Refuge near Jackson, Wyoming,

Hope Ryden looks over the country for coyotes.

The Wyoming rancher sits at the wheel of his parked,
beat-up, four-wheel-drive truck on the windswept
ridge and watches the slim, blonde woman slowly
approaching a black mustang. She is speaking to him
softly, singsong. The wild horse eyes her cautiously,
retreats slightly, but does not run.

“Do I think she has some miraculous way with
animals? I don’t know," muses the rancher, Lloyd
Tillett. “But I know that if she had three weeks here,
she’d get within ten feet of that wild horse.”

Hope Ryden, naturalist, author, photographer, ﬁlm
maker and wildlife defender, has come to the Pryor
Mountain Wild Horse Range, as she does every
spring, to check on this horse and his mares and foals,
as well as the other horses in this particular herd.

To go aﬁeld with Hope Ryden is to see determina-
tion incarnate. She scales the ridges to scan the hori-
zon or, undeterred by rocks and brambles, searches
out a stream bed to look for tracks. She reads the earth

 




A ﬁeld with Hope Ryden, naturalist

A friend and defender of the much-maligned and
persecuted American coyote, Hope Ryden was able

and it tells her what animals and how many went
here, and when.

Ryden intends to count every wild horse on the
Pryor Range and won’t go home until she has. She
feels it is important to know precisely how many there
are—which ones died over the winter, how many mares
have living foals. That way exact ﬁgures can be pre-
sented if the herd is assumed to be approaching over-
population. Ryden is an indefatigable activist on be-
half of these dwindling symbols of the Old West.

“Sergeant Pryor has a new mare,” she comments as
she climbs back into the cab of the truck. “That young
sorrel with the white blaze wasn’t in his harem last
year. She must be that ﬁlly from the bay’s harem—she
was two years old last year, remember? Sergeant Pryor
must have lured her away.”

Tillett, a Bunyanesque mountain of a man, long-
time friend of both Hope Ryden and the Pryor Moun-
tain mustangs, swings the truck into grumbling mo-
tion. It bounces slowly along the rutted, rocky, un-
graded path that serves as a road in this wilderness,
which 12 years ago was set aside as a refuge for one
of the last herds of America’s wild horses.

as well with his unaided eyes as the rest of us can with
binoculars. He and Hope Ryden joke about a govern-
ment ofﬁcial who once referred to “ocular reconnais-
sance”—“He meant he went out and eyeballed the
situation,” guffaws Tillett.

What strikes a novice upon ﬁrst attempting horse
counting in the Pryors is how difﬁcult it is to spot the
animals. Miss Ryden and Tillett can gaze at a hillside
two miles away and discuss the colors of the six or
eight horses there, plus all their foals “There’s an-
other one, a black one, lying in the grass,” Miss Ryden
will exclaim).

The ﬁrst mustangs were feral animals, once domes-
tic and descended from the noble mounts of the con-
quistadors. They still exhibit qualities of that blood-
line—smallish, compact, often with one less lumbar
vertebra, like Arabians. It looks as though the breed
tries to make up for that missing vertebra by growing
a longer tail, for the tail of the Pryor Mountain mus-
tang is no brushy little appendage but a glorious fall
of hair that may skim the ground at its heels. They
move so surefootedly and lightly they seem to ﬂoat.

The mustangs were traded or stolen from their
original Spanish owners by Indians in the 16th and
17th centuries. During many years of Indian warfare
and migrations, some two million horses escaped and

went wild. The early explorers in the 18005 encount-
ered herds of them sweeping across the land. Settlers
helped themselves to these horses whenever they could
catch and tame them. The modern cow pony owes
much to its mustang antecedents. As the West became
settled, the dwindling herds were heavily depleted by
the practice of mustanging—running down the ani-
mals, capturing them, and sometimes brutalizing
them into submission or death.

“Today mustangs are threatened by loss of habitat.
They are resented by many cattle growers in places
where the horses share the public land with livestock,”
points out Hope Ryden. “And the hunting establish-
ment would also like the mustangs off the public land
because they believe the horses compete for food with
game animals.

“It was the mustang that made me become a bedroll
naturalist. I had been a documentary ﬁlm maker,
came out here with a crew in 1968 to make a ﬁlm about
mustangs for ABC television news. I learned that these
horses had absolutely no protection from abuse or ex-
ploitation. There they were on public lands, harming

no one, at the mercy of anybody who came along. Be-
cause they were feral, they did not enjoy the legal
status of a wild animal and consequently the protec-
tion of legislation. I realized that if I was going to help
them effectively, I’d have to learn about them ﬁrst-
hand. So I spent three years studying them, living for
months at a time in many of the places they existed. I
had never been happier. I wrote three books about
them, and never went back to ﬁlm making full-time.”

The mustang is not without friends. The American
Horse Protection Association, a vigilant, politically
savvy group, has fought in the courts for seven years
on their behalf.

Miss Ryden is an adviser to the AHPA and an ac-
tive board member of Defenders of Wildlife. Her tes-
timony before Congress helped pass the “wild free-
roaming horses and burros” Act in 1971, and when
the Act was challenged she presented an amicus curiae
brief before the Supreme Court. The Act’s constitu-
tionality was upheld and the horses’ right to exist was
guaranteed, at least legally.

Face-to-face encounter with a wolf

HOpe Ryden was born in St. Paul, grew up in Illi-
nois, but every summer her family retreated to a cabin
in the woods of northern Wisconsin. There were few
other children for miles around the Rydens’ cabin, so
she became accustomed to spending hours in the for-
est alone, watching animals. She recalls a time when
she was about nine years old, meeting one of the last
wolves in that part of the country: “I was walking in
the woods when all of a sudden, there it was. We
looked at each other for a long moment. That wild
animal struck a deep note in me.”

She earned her bachelor’s degree at the University
of Iowa, did graduate work at Columbia, and began
a career in ﬁlm making. She wrote, produced and
directed some 40 ﬁlms that took her all over the world,
and was one of the group funded by Time Inc. that
transformed documentaries from staged movies to the
authentic cine’ma vérité they are today.

Hope Ryden regards her coyote studies as her most
signiﬁcant work. This greatly misunderstood and
much-maligned animal shares with the wolf a mythi-
cal and grandiose reputation for evil. It is regarded as
a marauder capable not only of decimating whole
ﬂocks of sheep but of bringing down deer, cattle, even
elk on the hoof. “In truth, its main diet is carrion and
small rodents,” Miss Ryden explains. “In areas where
hunting has limited the amount of carrion and pois-
oning programs have eliminated rodents, some coyotes
have acquired the habit of feeding on sheep.”

Coyotes are the most persecuted animals in the
United States, she says. They have been exterminated,

Cookie, she joins forces in a range cattle drive.

hundreds of thousands of them each year, by sheep
ranchers and by federal agents.
“I ﬁrst became interested in these animals in the

late Sixties while I was doing my wild horse studies,”
she recalls. “But though there’s plenty of lore about
them, I found very little information except about
their migrations and efﬁcient methods of killing them.
The late, great biologist Adolph Murie had made a
peerless study documenting the animal’s crucial role
as a scavenger in the food chain of an ecosystem. But
there were no reliable behavior observations. Canis
latrans has been hunted so relentlessly, the survivors
have become extremely clever and elusive.”

Miss Ryden began her ﬁeld studies of coyotes in
Wyoming, including two winters in Yellowstone,
tramping alone on snowshoes or cross-country skis
every day into the closed park to observe the coyotes
search for food in the snow-shrouded wilderness. The
ﬁrst spring, in the National Elk Refuge, she discovered
a den of pups. Sitting day after day in an irrigation
ditch or in a hay shed where she could keep the ani-
mals in view through her 20-power spotting scope, she
realized she was seeing the social behavior of a coyote
extended family—which had always been presumed

not to exist. She was the ﬁrst to publish observations
of “baby~sitting”—tending and feeding the young—by
an “aunt” or “uncle” coyote.

National Geographic magazine became interested
in what Hope Ryden was reporting and offered to
fund another season. So the following spring she got
permission to go off-road in a van in the Elk Refuge
and searched until she found the same coyotes she
had studied the previous year, at a new den.

“I knew you could never fool a coyote,” she says.
“And I knew they would never tolerate a person on
foot coming close. But I thought they might put up
with me in the van so long as they couldn’t see me.
So I determined never to show my face.”

Coming close to “God’s dog”

For seven weeks, she rose with the dawn and aimed
her binoculars or her camera through the curtained
door of the van, making notes, taking photographs.

Her unique study of these canines contributed much
valuable insight about them and disproved some of the
myths. She borrowed the Navajos’ name for the coyote
for the title of her book: God’s Dog.

Some time ago, as now seems natural, Ryden gave
up eating meat because, with her feeling for animals,
it didn’t go down that well and also because she feels
the scent of a meat-eater casts a predatory aura, enough
to repel the animals she wants to get very close to. She
has a way, this elegant, attractive woman, sitting at the
table with you in a fancy restaurant, of looking a long
way out into the distance. No one, you feel, could be
more tolerant of a poisonous spider, or a rattlesnake
she unwittingly stepped on (which she has).

To help subsidize her extensive ﬁeldwork, she some-
times returns to ﬁlm making. She spent the better part
of a year in Florida making a ﬁlm on the coastal wet-
lands for the Public Broadcasting System, and it was
during her work there that she caught sight from time
to time of a species of small, delicate, very beautiful
native deer. “Nobody could tell me much about them
except that they had been hunted to the edge of ex-
tinction and were now protected,” she says.

Her interest led to another year of ﬁeldwork. “I be-
gan tramping through the mangrove thickets. The
mosquitos were awful! Compared to them, the snakes
and alligators there were nothing. I wore netting over
my face and washed my clothes every night in mos-
quito repellent.”

Another problem she encountered was that in the
spring, when she wanted to photograph fawns, she
couldn’t ﬁnd where the does had hidden them. Infant
deer are well camouﬂaged, and their inborn ability to
remain immobile is extraordinary. They spend the
ﬁrst four weeks of their lives virtually alone, hidden

 




and motionless in the grass, visited by their cautious
mothers for perhaps only 30 minutes a day for nursing.

Some local people who became friends of Miss
Ryden allowed her to observe three semitame deer
that came into their yard to be fed. One day she hap-
pened to meet one of those does in the woods. The
animal didn’t run away, and she talked to it for a
while. When the deer began to move on, she didn’t
seem to mind being followed. The doe led her through
the mangroves to a higher ring of vegetation where
buttonwood trees grew. The doe stepped into a clear-
ing, and there was her fawn.

“I had been hunting in the wrong place. The doe
had shown me where to ﬁnd fawns—in the button-
woods and not in the mangroves,” Ryden recalls.
“Later on, in the fall, I concentrated on photograph-
ing bucks.” Her observations and photographs of these
deer (p.120) resulted in The Little Deer of the Florida
Keys. It won four awards.

“I once read a magazine article entitled ‘You’ll
Never See a Bobcat,’ ” says Miss Ryden. “But I, with
all the arrogance in the world—that’s the animal I took
on next. I would never have attempted it if I had
realized what I now know about how furtive and re-
clusive bobcats are.”

She began studying bobcats in her usual fashion. “I

some, I just stay where they are. I quietly blend into
the landscape and wait, maybe for days and weeks.
The animals study me long before I ever see them.

“Do I carry a gun for protection? No—never. I be-
lieve animals know when you’re armed—they pick it
up from subtle changes in your body language, and
they make sure you never see them. And I always have
to be alone when I’m doing a ﬁeld study. If you’re
with someone, you talk; also, there’s twice the human
smell for the animals to pick up.

“I am perfectly happy to live anywhere under any
conditions when I’m working. My work is an endless
learning process. In the ﬁeld, I just watch the animals,
take photographs and make notes. Then I go home to
New York and plug into the great energy battery the
city provide-s and do my writing.” (An article on bob-
cats by Hope Ryden, illustrated with her photographs,
will appear in a future issue of SMITHSONIAN.)

One secret Hope Ryden guards is her age. Another
mystery is why she has never married. “She came close
once, but she wouldn’t tell him her age, so the whole
deal fell through,” Lloyd Tillett cracks.

Her own comment is: “I might ﬁnd myself with

Dear Mr. Nevin:

I want to express the appreciation of the Animal Welfare Institute
for your article on Mike Fox and the major animal abuses he described
and you brought so vividly to public attention. It was good, too.

to see excerpts reprinted in the Boston gundaz Globe. I hope you
will continue to bring those subjects to the American public. for
they have received far less attention hora than in Europe.

A third major area in which the United States is far behind is
the trapping by cruel means of furbaamm and predators. Forty-
eight countries have outlawed tho staelujaw loghold trap, but the
United States continues to insist upon its use. Encloaad is a
copy of Facts About Furs, just published by the Animal Welfare
Institute. I hope you may find a way to bring some of thaaa faota
to public attention.

The Keller-t study. done under the auspices of tha Yale School of
Forestry and Environmental Studies under contract to the U. 8.
Fish and Wildlife Service, shows that throe—quartera of the Amariw
can public oppoee the use of the stool trapwrightly so. in View
of the appalling suffering and injury it causes.

The amazing stubbornness of industry in its determination to
Whitewash steel-jaw leghold traps is wall exampliflad in the
encloaad notice in 33?. A93 Weekly. which caused us to obtain the
study it referred to. Excerpta from the study are xeroxod along
with the notice so you can see that two of the four coyotas in
the study chewed off their feet and died of starvation.

Is this abuse necessary?

A practical scientist fights man’s random cruelty to animals

By David Nevin

e comes swinging through the

drooping moustache and a very
quick smile. and pulling ahead

~ on a long strap leash is a wotf.
You don‘t expect to see a wolf in a city park in
Washington, D.C., so you ask him -— it's really
a dog. is it not. just an oddlooking dog, leaner
and larger and more feral than most dogs?

“Oh, no," he says in an impeccable British

accent, most professional. most assured. smil- .

ing, “it’s a wolf, left over from a research

pack. ‘I studied wolves and their behavior for ‘

years. This is the only one left."

He introduces himself: He is Michael W.
, Fox, veterinarian. animal ethologist. scientist.
crusader for animal rights. And readily, there
in the park. with the wolf gamboling at the
end of the leash as people stop to gape, he ticks
off in his crisp accent the Obscenities that an
ever larger. ever more sophisticated and tech-
nological culture works on animals today. He
'used to be part of that world and its effects
obsess him. Now he intends to change it.

What Obsesses Michael Fox is the range of
abuses routinely inflicted upon livestock and

ples of unnecessary suffering that are all too
easy to find.

cows and bull calves become veal. But first —
in the modern veal systems -— they will live for
16 weeks in a chute like those on this Virginia
farm. «

The farmer has a frightening investment
and he obeys the rules of the feed company.
which for the first year supplies the calves. the
feed and the medication. on which he depends.
Each animal is chained in place. The calf can
back up 12 inches and he can thrust out his
head to eat the high-intensity mash made of
milk solids low in iron. (This diet induces ane-
mia. which results in the white meat prized in
veal.) ..

The chute floor is of slats. It is rough when
he lies down. for it has no straw. which would _
interfere with the cleaning and which he '
would eat. since at about three weeks he re- :
quires rOughage to develop his rumen. The calf
learns to brace his cloven hoofs against the
craCks and his leg muscles develop for bracing
instead of walking. The lights are on only at

5 feeding ‘time; the calf lives in darkness 22
‘ hoursa day; this reduces motion, andis said
, to produce more tender meat. The calf can

barely move -— he stands perpetually in one

position or else he lies in his cold feces.

life in darkness, almost motionless in a cage
the size of a coffin. and he will never have
turned or stretched or run or touched another
calf or had a bit of roughage. and when he
comes out for slaughter on untried legs. he
may fall down.

Laying en cages

The cruelty of such isolation is matched by
the bucolic bedlam in which modern hens are
kept. After a lifetime in the egg business. an-
other Southern farmer finally put his hens in
battery cages, which is the method used in at
least 90 percent of American egg production.

For years his hens had lived in 38 separate
houses, scratching about in the yard‘by day
and roosting by night. The houses stretched
up and down the hills of his farm near Chesa-
peake Bay. But his old father, who always re-
sisted change, went into a nursing home, his
sons weren‘t very interested. hired hands were
hard to find and he couldn't handle alone the
awful labor of 38 separate chicken houses. He
built two long, narrow barns and installed
standard laying-hen cages. '

He is a small-scale operator by the stand-
ards of the modern chicken industry; he has
10,400 birds.

" The cages are in long banks. Running
along each bank is a trough" carrying water
and a small conveyor belt carrying feed. The
cages, with no perches, are made of wiremesh
which allows feces to fall through. The mesh
catches eggs, which roll forward for collection.

Each cage is 12 by 18 inches and four birds
are put into each. Four chickens are crowded
in a space 12 by 18 inches, so they scramble;
pecking and clawing each other, and one of
the four generally is on the bottom.

The lights are on 18 hours a day to encour-
age the chickens to lay constantly. And it is a
disastrous anomaly for the chicken that under
these hellish conditions, egg production rises.
Each hen averages an egg every 32 hours for
14 months and then goes to slaughter. And if
the cages and the lights and sheer hard use of
the birds seem like a scene conceived by

Dante, well. who really is to say what a chick- '

ten wants? _

. Most people would agree that animals have
rights, but there is far less agreement on what

those rights are. or. how far they extend.

Animal ethology is the study of animal be-
havior — the nature of the animal - done in
terms of its environment. It is that emphasis
on the animal's nature that makes Fox effec-
tive today. '

Fox came to the United States in 1962 for a
research fellowship in Maine. Then he went to
a research hospital in Illinois and on to a pro-
fessorship in psychology at Washington Uni-
versity in St. Louis. His work in canid ethology
— specifically, examining the effects of domes
tication on dogs compared with wolves — led
to his second doctorate from London Universi-
ty‘and a growing reputation. ,

About this time John Hoyt. president of the
Humane Society of the United States, was put-
ting together the Institute for the Study of Ani-
mal Problems. The trouble with the old
humane approach. Hoyt thought. was its lack
of scientific rigor. '

What animal rights needed. Hoyt thought,‘
was its own scientist —- and Fox proved to be
just the man he was seeking. The institute
opened in late 1976 with Fox as its director.

Vast numbers of animals are involved in
the problem. American laboratories use some

20 million animals a year, of which about 18 ;

million are rats and mice. The livestock indus-
try handles 4 billion creatures a year. of which
3.5 billion are poultry.

Fox's role is a natural for an ethologist‘be- 1

cause his training is to see the animal as an

ed, remote, antiseptic, seientific time, this is
not so easily done.

In factory farming. all the emphasis is_on
economies of scale. mechanization that re-
duces labor costs and maximum production
per unit of time. The laying hens in their tiny
cages become egg machines — feed them, wa-
ter them and collect their eggs. The lights are
on unnaturally long hours to make them lay
more, just as there are experiments to make
beef cattle and other animals eat more and
thus gain faster. -

“It is ecological and economic suicide to
continue this," Fox says, ., .

Fox is not preaching vegetarianism (which
is one reason some animal rights advocates
consider him a sellout). ”In a highly technolog~
ical society," he insists, “it is sound to eat
some animal products, because we have a lot
of industrial and agricultural byproducts that
can be recycled through animals. . .

”if some animal liberationists had their
way." Fox adds, "they would let all farm ani-
mals loose, and have them out free ranging.
That would mean more destruction of natural
habitat, causing greater ecological imbalance
than we have already.”

Fox argues with similar moderation for re-
duced use of animals in scientific research.

“The Humane Society is not antivivisec—
tionist,” he says, ”nor am 1. Our policy is that
animal suffering is justifiable if it can be dem-
onstrated that it is going to alleviate a greater

suffering in other animals or man.” The prob«
lem is that the same “intensive use" which
characterizes factory farming also runs
through the lab animal world, as when count-
less products such as hair rinses, or sham-

., .poos, are tested in a rabbit‘s eye, sometimes
. causmg acute painand blindness.

“One of my primary roles,” Fox says, “is to

; raise consciousness. to get people to see ani—
animal. In our increasingly production-orient- ,

mals as animals and treat them so. Sometimes
so little can make such a difference. The self—
mutilating monkey may not want out of its
cage as much as it wants companionship. Put
mirrors before a monkey’s cage and you have
improved its life. Give chickens perches. It has
been proved that pigs get along best with no

. more than 29 in a pen. Let confinement pigs

get together — that‘s all they want. Put veal
calves four to a pen and let them move around.
And, my God. it seems that laying-hen cages

Cruel deprivation

. Total confinement pig barns may be the
worst abuse of all. for there sows live for years

the animal's intrinsic nature and its needs. It
’ is inhumane to deprive an animal of its natu-
, ral needs, he says, just as it is inhumane to
inﬂict unnecessary pain. f
Adopting a simple code first proposed in-
‘ England, Fox suggests that all farm and labo-
ratory animals should be granted five basic
rights. or “freedoms": the freedom to be able
., easily to get up: lie down: turn around: stretch:
and groom or preen. Social animals. he points
out, should have a right to some kind of social
interaction. What rights does a veal calf have?

“Veal calves have eyes and legs." Fox says,
"therefore they should have light to see by and
sufficient freedom to move." This is not deter-
mined by scientific research, he adds. “It's
obvious.“

chained alone in cages while they nurture
litter after litter of piglets. Like veal calves
they “never touch each other —- and anyone
who has ever seen pigs nudging, scratching
and licking each other in a pen will ‘under-
stand the deprivation.

“All animals engage in social grooming."
Fox says. “It is absolutely basic to their lives.
It keeps them neat and healthy, but even more
important, it is their basic mode of social in—
“teraction — which is the trouble with isolating

Animal Rights Society

 

Plans Series of Seminars

By GEORGE A. FORD

Seminars for Activists on the west
and east coasts, demonstrates against
cosmetic tests on animals and a demon-
stration against fur are planned by the
Society for Animal Rights within «the
coming months.

The society’s first seminars, con-
ducted last year in Clarks Summit and
Boston, were well attended and well
received. Similar programs have been
scheduled for Los Angeles and Phila-
delphia. Other cities are under consid-
eration for additional seminars.

The purpose of the seminars is to
provide information on organizing
committees or organizations against
the exploitation and abuse of animals;
on obtaining documentary evidence of
the abuse of animals; on the prepara-
tion of material for printing; on suc-
cessful demonstrations and other ac-
tivities, all related to calling public
attention to the suffering of animals
and securing rights for animals.

Citizens for Animals, the society’s
lobby and political arm, will co—sponsor
the seminars, providing information on
urgently needed political activity for
animals. Plans for 1980 also include
seeking a working relationship with
other organizations in the development
of strategy and action directed to end-
ing exnsrimeotation on animals. 'The
Society’s current campaign against cos-
metic tests on animals is an Opening
effort which is intended to end one
entire field of experimentation. When
success is achieved in that area, the
same experiments performed to test
other products can more easily be end-
ed. Although cosmetics are not required
by law or regulation to be tested on ani-
mals, other products are, in some cases
by law, in others by regulation.

The society believes that concerted,
well-planned action is needed by a num-
ber of organizations, both existing and
yet to be formed, to bring the gigantic
evil of experimentation, financed by

billions of dollars of the taxpayers’
money and the corporate wealth of
drug, chemical and other companies, to
an end. The group wants to organize

 
 

 

Let’s Talk Dogs

mass rallies and demonstrations in the
cities of New York and Los Angeles in
October, 1980, and will appreciate
hearing from organizations wishing to
be represented.

In 1978 it was reported almost one-
third of the students enrolled in veteri-
nary colleges in the United States and
Canada were women. The proportion
apparently will go even higher, if the
latest information from the University
of Pennsylvania can be taken as a
guide. The university’s School of Veteri-
nary Medicine recently announced that
women outnumber men in an incoming
class for the first time in the school’s
96wyear history. There are 55 women
and 54 men in the class of 1983.

Dog owners who keep their pets out-
side all year are reminded that the
dog’s house should be cleaned regularly
to prevent the harboring of unwelcome
guests such as ﬂeas, ticks or other para-
sites. -

No matter what kind of material is
used for bedding inside the house,
cleanliness is the most important con-
sideration for the dog’s comfort and
well-being. If shredded neWSpaper or
wood shavings are used, they should be
swept out and replaced every week. If
old carpeting, blankets or towels are
used they must be cleaned every week,
too.

The interior walls of the doghouse
should be scrubbed clean every few
weeks and allowed to dry completely
before the dog is permitted to occupy it
again. Dampness is the dog’s enemy, so
the walls and roof should also be
checked for cracks which might allow
water to enter. .

Activists Center Attention on the Steel Jaw Leg-hold Trap

  
  
 
  
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

Humanitarians rallied in Columbus
Circle in March to draw attention to
the cruel and miserable ways in which
animals are killed for their fur. While
hundreds of fur merchants, manufac-
turers, designers, and trappers at-
tended the annual International Fur
Fair inside the New York Coliseum,
concerned representatives from the
ASPCA and other humane organiza-
tions marched in protest outside.

The fur industry continues to use the
deplorable steel jaw trap, which is so
inhumane that it has been banned in
forty countries. The trap mercilessly
snaps shut, indiscriminately gripping
innocent victims by the leg until star-
vation, blood loss, predators, or the
trappers ﬁnally kill them. Some ani-
mals are able to chew off their paw,
leave it behind, and limp away, but
even they stand a slim chance of
survival. The steel jaw ensnares about
80% of the 1,400,000 animals trapped
annually in New York. Approximately
70% of these creatures are then dis-
carded because they are not the type of
animal the trapper meant to catch.

So-called “ranch-farming” is no bet-
ter. Minks and chinchillas are force-
bred and spend their entire lives in
cages no bigger than shoe boxes. The
animals are killed by electrocution,
painful gassing, decompression, or
cyanide, or by having their necks
broken with devices resembling nut
crackers.

The ASPCA hopes that with con
tinued attention and pressure directed
at the fur industry, the general public
will realize that beautiful and less
expensive “fake furs” are just as warm
and fashionable as real furs and cause
no animal to suffer.

Greetings:

I am enclosing an outstanding short article i want
to share with you. it was written for a recent

issue of MS. MAGAZINE - by Alice Walker, who as you
know wrote "Color Purple”.

I was deeply touched by this sensitive piece and
somehow believe you will respond as I did. Please
set aside a few quiet moments to read it, and I
promise it will bring a tear....or two. How
reassuring to know that a young writer of such
great talent has been touched by an emotion that

is so paramount in our lives.

‘Aint These Tears in These Eyes Tell’én’ You?” *

FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS MY
partner and I rented a small house in
the country that stood on the edge of a
large meadow that appeared to ruh from
the end of our deck straight into the
mountains. The mountains, however,
were quite far away, and between us and
them there was, in fact, a town. It was
one of the many pleasant aspects of the
house that you never really were aware
of this.

It was a house of many windows,
low, wide, nearly ﬂoor to ceiling ones in
the living room that faced the meadow,
and it was from one of these that I first
saw our closest. neighbor, a large white
horse who ambled about cropping grass
and ﬂipping its manemnot over the en—
tire meadow, which stretched well out of
sight of the house, but over the five or so
fenced-in acres that went with the
twenty—odd that we had rented. I soon
learned that the horse, whose name was
Blue, belonged to a man who lived in
another town, but was boarded by our
neighbors next door. Occasionally, one
of the children, usually a stocky teen-
ager, but sometimes a much younger girl
or boy, could be seen riding Blue. They
would appear in the meadow, climb up
on his back, ride furiously for 10 or 15
minutes, then get off, slap Blue on the
ﬂanks, and not be Seen again for a month
or more.

There were many apple trees in our
yard, and one by the fence that Blue
could almost reach. We were soon in the
habit of feeding him apples, which he re—
iisheci, especially because by the middle
of summer the meadow grasses—~80
green and succulent since January——
had dried out from lack of rain, and Blue
stumbled about munching the dried
stalks half-heartedly. Sometimes he
would stand very still just by the apple
tree and when one of us came out he
would whinny, snort loudly, or stamp the
ground. This meant, of course: I want an
apple.

It was quite wonderful to pick a few
apples, or collect those that had fallen to
the ground overnight, and patiently hold
them, one by one, to his large, toothy

mouth. I remained as thrilled as a child
by his ﬂexible dark lips, huge, cubelike
teeth that crunched the apples, core and
all, with such finality, and his high,
broad—breasted enormity; beside which,
I felt small indeed. When I was a child, I
used to ride horses, and was especially
friendly with one named Nan until one
day I was riding her and one of my
brothers deliberately spooked her and I
was thrown, head first, against the trunk
of a tree. When I came to, I was in bed
and my mother was bending worriedly
over me; we silently agreed that. perhaps

horseback riding was not the safest
sport for me. Since then I have walked,
and prefer walking to I‘iorseback rid-
ing-~but I had forgotten the depth of

' feeling one could see in horses’ eyes.

I was therefore unprepared for the
expression in Blue’s. Blue was lonely.
Blue was horribly lonely and bored. I was
not shocked that this should be the case;
five acres to tramp by yourself, end-
lessly, even in the most beautiful of
meadows—and his was—cannot pro-
vide many interesting events, and once
rainy season turned to dry that was
about it. No, I was shocked that I had for-
gotten that human animals and nonhu‘
man animals can communicate quite
well; if we are brought. up around ani-
mals as children we take this for granted.
By the time we are adults we no longer

 

remember. However, the animals have
not changed. They are in fact cmrzpleted
creations (at. least they seem to be so
much more than we) who are not likely
to change; it is their nature to express
themselves. What else are they going to
express? And they do. And, generally
speaking, they are ignored.

After giving Blue the apples, 1 wan-
dered back to the house, aware that he.
was observing me. Were more apples not
forthcoming then? Was that to be his
sole entertainment for the day? My part~
ner’s small son had decided he wanted to
learn how to piece a quilt; we worked in
silence on our respective squares as I
thought. . .

Well, about Slavery: about white
children, who were raised by black
people, who knew their first. all—accept-
ing love from black women. and then.
when they were 12 or so, they were. told
they must “forget" the deep levels of
communication between themselves
and “mammy” that they knew. Later
they would be able to relate quite calmly,
“My old mammy was sold to another
good family.” “My old mammy was '
_.___ .” Fill in the blank. Many more years
latera white woman would say: “I can’t
understand these Negroes, these blacks.
What do they want? They’re so different
from us.”

And about the Indians, considered
“like animals” by the “settlers” (a very
benign euphemism for what they actu-
ally were), who did. not understand their
description as a complement.

And of the thousands of American
men who marry Japanese, Korean,
Filipina, and other non-English—speak—
ing women and of how happy they report
they are, “blissfully, ” until their brides
learn to speak English, at which point
the marriages tend to fall apart. What
then did the men see, when they looked
into the eyes Of the women they married,
before they could speak English? Appa—
rently only their own reflections.

I thought of society’s impatience
with the young. “Why are they playing
the music so loud?" Perhaps the chil-
dren have listened to much of the music
of oppressed people their parents
danced to before they were born, with its

passionate but soft cries for acceptance
and love, and they have wondered why
their parents failed to hear.

I do not know how long Blue had in-
habited his five beautiful, boring acres
before we moved into our house; a year
after we arrived and had also traveled to
other valleys, other cities, other
worlds—he was still there.

But then, in our second year at the
house, something happened in Blue’s
life. One morning, looking out the win-
dow at the fog that lay like a ribbon over
the meadow, I saw another horse, a
brown one, at the other end of Blue’s
field. Blue appeared to be afraid of it, and
for several days made no attempt to
come near. We went away for a week.
When we returned, Blue had decided to
make friends and the two horses ambled
or galloped along together, and Blue did
not come nearly as often to the fence un~
derneath the apple tree.

When he did, bringing his new
friend with him, there was a different.
look in his eyes. A look of independence,
of self~possession, of inalienable horse-
ness. His friend eventually became preg~
nant. For months and months there was,
it seemed to me, a mutual feeling of fair-
ness, of peace. I fed apples to them both.
The look in Blue’s eyes was one of un-
abashed “this IS itness."

It did not, however, last forever.
One day, after a visit to the city, I came
out to give Blue some apples. He stood
waiting, or so I thought, though not be
neath the tree. When I shook the tree
and jumped back from the shower of ap—
ples, he made no move. I carried some
over to him. He managed to half—crunch
one. The rest he let fall to the ground. I
dreaded looking into his eyes-because
I had of course noticed that Brown, his
partner, had gone—~but I did. If I had
been born into slavery, and my partner
had been sold or Killed, myeyes would
have looked like that. The children next
door explained that Blue’s partner had
been “put with him” (the same expres—
sion that old people used, I had noticed,
when speaking of an ancestor during
slavery who had been impregnated by
her owner) so that they could mate and
she conceive. Since that was ac—
complished, she'had been taken back by
her owner, who lived somewhere else.

Will she be back? I asked.

They didn’t know.

Blue was like a crazed person. Blue
was, to me, a crazed person. He galloped
furiously, as if he were being ridden,
around and around his five beautiful
acres. He whinnied until he couldn’t. He
tore at the ground with his hooves. He

 

butted himself against his single shade
tree. He looked always and always to—
ward the road down which his partner
had gone. And then, occasionally, when
he came up for apples, or I took apples to
him, he looked at me. It was a look so
piercing, so full of grief, a look so
human, I almost laughed (I felt too sad
to cry) to think there are people who do
not know that animals suffer. People like
me who have forgotten, and daily forget,
all that animals try to tell us. “Everything
you do to us will happen to you; we are
your teachers, as you are ours. We are
one lesson,” is basically it, I think. There
are those who never once have even
considered animals’ rights: those who
have been taught that animals actually
want to be used and abused by' us, as
small children “love” to be frightened, or
women “love” to be mutilated and
raped. . . . They are the great grandchil-
dren of those who honestly thought, be-
cause someone taught them this:
“women can’t think,” and “triggers can’t
faint." But most disturbing of all, in
Blue’s large brown eyes, was a new look
more painful than the look of despair:
the look of disgust with human beings,
with life; the look of hatred. And it was
odd what the look of hatred did. It. gave
him, for the first time, the look of a beast.
And what that meant was that. he had
put up a barrier within to protect. himself
from further violence; all the apples in
the world wouldn’t change that fact.

And so Blue remained, a beautiful
part of our landscape, very peaceful to
look at from the Window, white against
the grass. Once a friend came to visit and
said, looking out on the soothing View:
“And it would have to be a white horse;
the very image of freedom.” And I
thought, yes, the animals are forcedcto
become for us merely “images” of what
they once so beautifully expressed. And
we are used to drinking milk from con—
tainers showing “contented” cows,
whose real lives we want to hear nothing
about, eating eggs and drumsticks from
“happy” hens, and munching hamburg—
ers advertised by bulls of integrity who
seem to command their fate.

As we talked of freedom and justice
one day for all, we sat down to steaks. I
am eating misery, I thought, as I took the
first bite. And spit it out.

 

Alice Walker is someone who would like to
be a vegetarian She has stopped eating
beef; except for the occasional burger——
which reminds her she is a meat addict——
but still eats chicken and fish She has not
found the courage so far to go cold tu rkey,

awareness of the feelings of animals to
pres‘sure herself along.

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Yesterday morning I spoke to Cathy Liss about the possibility of interviewing you for a
book titled The Scalpel and the Butterfly: The War Between Animal Research and Animal
Protection. This book is a popular history of the research/anti-vivisection conflict which
will be published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in New York'City. I am writing this book
because during the nearly seven years I worked as a an editor/writer at the Johns Hopkins
Center for Alternative to Animal Testing I came to know and respect many people with
different perspectives on this issue. I have also done quite a hit of historical research and
found that the same holds true for those who have struggled with this issue in the past. For
example, I admire both pioneering physiologist Claude Bernard, whose Introduction to the
Study of Experimental Medicine helped create modern biological research, and Anna
Kingsford, physician, mystic and antivivisectionist, whose perspective on nature and

animals f oreshadows contemporary animal rights philosophy.

I am currently researching Chapter Five of my book, which will chart the rapid growth of
animal experimentation in the US. following World War 11.: In this chapter I will also
describe the passage of the Animal Welfare Act—~an achievement in which you played a
crucial role. I’d like to talk with you about the founding of the Animal Welfare Institute,
the development of your worldview as both the daughter of a physician/ researcher and
animal protectionist and your ability to integrate these roles into a unique perspective. I’d
also like to discuss your funding of Russell and Burch’s UFAW research and how that
came about. My research has led me to conclude that your role in developing a pragmatic
approach to this conflict has not received the scholarly attention it deserves.

I look forward to hearing from you and hope to discuss all of these things at your earliest
possible convenience.

PS. If you’d like a personal recommendation before agreeing to meet with me, I’m sure
that either Andrew Rowan or Henry Spira would be happy to vouch for me.

THE ADVENTURER‘

Centuries of History and Culture

' By JACQUELINE T BESCOTT
Washington Post Staff Writer

 

The elder uncles have
paused in their ritual
card game and pushed
their pots of quarters
aside to relive the career
of a great baseball player,
Willie Mays. They de-
scribe the muscular
swing, the way he com-
manded center ﬁeld and
hugged the wall in New
York’s Polo Grounds.
The uncles get loud,
scrape back their chairs,
disagreeing over details
about a catch in the 1954
World Series. Did Mays fall on his knees? Was he ﬂat
against the wall?

In the past that historic moment would be jumbled
in the quicksand 'of memories, revived again for
another argument. But now the uncles can turn to
Encarta Africana, a multimedia encyclopedia that
among its more than 3,000 articles and numerous
video clips has black-and-white proof of Mays’s incred-
ible feat. He did lose his hat, he did end up on his
knees, and he was close to the wall as he caught,
barehanded, a ball off the Cleveland Indians and saved
the ﬁrst game of the Series for the Giants- ,

With only months to go in the century, a team of
researchers led by Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Kwame
Anthony Appiah of Harvard University has joined
Microsoft to produce a sweeping electronic compila-
tion of . black history and culture from the African
continent to the Caribbean to the United States. It
fulﬁlls a goal that W.E.B. Du Bois, the leading black
intellectual of the century, set in 1909—to show the,
long history of African civilizations, to show the feats
of soldiers, politicians and teachers, to show how an
artistic output from architecture to song could inﬂu-
ence a wOrldwide Culture. .

Nothing like this encyclopedia, which was released
yesterday on two CD-ROMs, has existed before.

Baseball great Willie Mays:
The Encarta Africana discs
include a video clip of his
famous 1954 catch.

wilderness. - ‘
Wade Davis, who was working as a hunting
guide nearby, heard about the moose and went
back to retrieve it. He butchered the beast,
ﬁlled his canoe with more than 1,000 pounds of
meat and paddled back to the hunting camp.
Drenched in moose blood, he presented the
meat to an old Gitxsan Indian named Alex Jack.
For months, Davis had been coaxing Jack to
tell him the legends of his people, but Jack just

that make other magazine publishers weep with envy.
Owning Bride’s is about as close as publishers get to
. having a license to print money. In fact, the trademarked
Bride’s motto at the bottom of the press release pretty
much said it all: “Where Love Meets Money.” '

A few days after the arrival of the behemoth Bride’s—
which weighs in at 4 pounds 9 ounces—I received two
more gargantuan bridal magazines: Modern Bride, at
930 pages and 3 pounds 11 ounces; and the weddings
issue of Martha Stewart Living, comparatively anorexic
at only 408 pages and a tad less than two pounds.
Finding myself in pOssession [of over 10 pounds of bridal
mags, I ﬁgured I’d better investigate this phenomenon.

I’ve never been a bride, so I’ve never perused bridal
magazines. (I was a groom once, but I prepared for my
wedding by getting so drunk at the bachelOr party that I
was nearly catatonic the next morning, when, according

to eyewitnesses, I gOt married.)

Thus I come to the subject of brides’ magazines utterly
fresh and completely objective. And now, after careful
reading—well, careful skimming—of 2,680 pages of
bridal coverage, I have learned many things. I learned
that a good gift for bridesmaids is a “one-of-a-kind
handblown paperweight.” I learned that addressing
wedding invitations is so painful that you should buy a
special “cushioned” pen—“prices start at $50.” I learned
that Melissa Levis, a New York singer-songwriter, will
serenade your wedding with a custom-made song for
only $2,000. Sample lyrics: “A six-week romance, one
year to reconvene/ Now it’s happily ever after for Rob

and Francine.”

I also learned that this year’s hot fashion trend for
brides is: long, thick bridal armpit hair dyed blond and
carefully braided into comrows, then tied with a bright

red ribbon.

Just kidding, future brides. I made that up. Actually, .
this year’s hot fashion trend for brides is: long white
dresses. There are approximately 9,243,792 pictures of
brides wearing long white dresses in these magazines.
I’d say that qualiﬁes as an authentic trend. Remember:

You read it here ﬁrst. .

To the average man, these dresses are virtually
identical, the only difference being how much bosom
they reveal. But apparently there are other, subtler
differences that can only be discerned by women and

day.”

stance, Bride’s reveals that this
year the designers have, in
their inﬁnite wisdom, decided
to “focus on sleeves.” And the
result of this heightened atten-
tion is sleeves that range from .
“ultra-long, knuckle-grazing
demi-bell designs” to “delicate
silk-organza doughnuts worn
high on the arm.”

Actually, if you’re going to
wear a doughnut of any kind
high on your arm during your
wedding, you might want to
check out Modern Bride’s ad-
vice for brides who sweat too
much: “Apply a thin layer of
Drysol to your armpits at night,
then 'wrap a thin layer of Saran
Wrap over your pits, and pull -
on a tight t—shirt (to keep you
from unraveling). . .. Do this
each night for two weeks before
your wedding, and you won’t ;
sweat a drop on your wedding

For in-

The articles in these maga-
zines are delightfully loopy. For instance, Bride’s 11213.3
piece about “how your ﬁance’s proposal can clue YOU in
on his partner potential.” If your ﬁance proposed”
hiring a blimp to ﬂash “Gillian, Will You Marry Me? to

you at a footbalhstadimn packed with 50,000 people,

Bride’s types him as “The Exhibitionist” and concludes
that ‘This guy is going to be fun!” But the mag also
summons a shrink who adds this brilliant insight: “He

should only propose to a woman before ﬁfty thousand

people if she’s the type who’d like that.” - .
Bride’s also has a piece on how to get in shape “(1.1116
planning your wedding. It proposes the followrng
wedding-related aerobic activities: “Climbing the stall’S
of your former roommate’s high-rise apartment bulldlng ‘
to break the news of your engagement” and “Walking
around the mall to look at shoes, rehearsal-dinner
dresses, and something naughty to wear on your
wedding night.” Not to mention “Crying tears OfJOY after
accepting his proposal.” I think this is a humor piece but

it’s hard to tell.

One. thing conspicuously missing from all these
malgalzmes is the groom—and all men for that matter.
The ratio of females to males in the photographs is well
. over 100 to 1. In fact, if beings from outer space read
these mags to study, the phenomenon of '
marnage, they would probably conclude that weddings ’ .
are an exclusively female phenomenon. And their
suspicions would be conﬁrmed by the ads for Vera Wang
Brldal Salons, which show a bunch of brides with short,
severe haircuts hanging all over each other.

Obviously, grooms need their own magazine. The
only problem is grooms are utterly uninterested in
weddings. They’re more interested in bachelor parties.
The ideal issue of Modern Groom would consist of 1,241
Pages of ads for booze and strip clubs and one sentence
of advice: “Don’t have your bachelor party on the night
before your wedding if you hope to remember anything

at all about the ceremony.”

ast week was deadly quiet. Except for the
president being tried for high crimes and
misdemeanors, American jets attacking
Iraqi targets, an Israeli election and ﬁghting in
Yugoslavia, nothing happened, and all of us in
the news business yawned.

Then the big bomb dropped. Michael Jordan
quit basketball. That’s what Isaid: Michael
Jordan hung up his Nikes and went home to
count his money. Everyone went into
shock—the greatest basketball player of all time
would no longer be with us.

Americans who had been through a lot never
dreamed they would see this day. They gathered
in bars and barbershops, in Wendy’ s,
McDonald’s and Pizza Hut, staring at the screen
as Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather
broke the news and Christiane Amanpour of
CNN reported Iraqi reaction to the bulletin.

In America kids on playgrounds stopped
shooting foul shots for one minute tomark the
tragedy, and all the NBA teams agreed to donate
10 percent of their gates to the Michael Jordan
Pension Fund.

The man in the street was the most affected
by the resignation. Ira Harris, a Bulls fan, had
tears in his eyes when he said, “I never thought ‘
Iron Mike would leave. He made Chicago truly a
second city.”

Christopher Reutershan said, “What got me
furious was when several of the stations that
were broadcasting the story about Michael
Jordan interrupted to update us on the
president’s Senate trial. Don’t the news
directors have any judgment at all?”

Whatever those of us who feed off the big
stories thought, we had to admit there was
nothing bigger than Michael Jordan’s exit. Not
only the United States but also the world will be a
poorer place without Michael dunking in the ball.

The Adventures
f Wade Davis

DAVIS, From CI

 

ﬁve of them written by Davis, in-
cluding his latest, a collection of
travel essays called “Shadows in the
, Sun,” and his most famous, “The
Serpent and the Rainbow,” a best-
selling study of Haitian voodoo that
was made into a movie so awful that
it is now a cult classic.

Davis, 45, has a bachelor’s degree
in anthropology and a PhD in ethno-
botany. He makes his living as a
writer and lecturer. He describes
himself as “an independent scholar.”
But he is really something far more
romantic, something that millions of
adolescent boys once dreamed of
becoming, something that seems
like an anachronism in the late 20th
century. 9

He is an adventur .

He has slogged through the rain
forest and trekked across the arctic
tundra. He has watched women pos-
sessed by spirits chew burning coals
in voodoo rituals. He has hunted with
an Ecuadoran tribe so warlike that
nearly half its members die in battle.

He has eaten live termites and fried '
grabs and roasted monkeys that .

looked disturbingly like little babies.
He has drunk the hallucinogen apa-
huasca with a painted shaman in
Colombia and watched as the heav-
ens and the Earth cracked open,

At a time when his Harvard

classmates were carefully climbing ‘

the corporate ladder, Davis was
searching for adventure. He not only
found it, he also found some fame
and fortrme and the love of a beauti-
ful woman, Gail Percy, who hap-
pened to be an anthropologist and a
model and the daughter of former
senator Charles Percy. Now they
have two daughters, a house in
Georgetown and a hunting lodge in
British Columbia that stands across
a lake from an uninhabited area the
size of Ireland.

So, who needs the corporate lad-
der?

“I’ve been extremely lucky,” he
says.

“Themanskatesonthinicewith
a lot of sparkle,” says Daniel Taylor-
Ides, who has trekked through the
Himalayas with Davis. “Wade loves
an adventure. If there isn’t one
happening, he’ll make one.”

Beneath the Quest

His lifelong search for adventure,
he says, is a reaction to his father’s
quest for security. ,

His father, Edmund Davis,
worked for a bank, ﬁrst in Montreal,
then in British Columbia. He went
to work in the morning, managed
people’s estates all day, came home
for dinner. It was respectable work,
but hardly the stuff of adventure or
POCtI'Y- 9

Davis wanted something more
exciting. As a boy, he memorized
the routes of the old Canadian fur
traders. He got his ﬁrst chance for
adventure at 14, when his Spanish
teacher arranged for him to spend
the summer on a farm in the Colour-
bian Andes.

“I was just ecstatic the whole

 

time,” he says. “I kissed a girl for the ,

    

ﬁrst time, got drunk for the ﬁrst
time, rode horses backwards for the
ﬁrst time. Going to Colombia was a
pivotal experience for me, because it
gave me a sense of being thrown on
the benevolence of the world. It’s
naive, but you get imprinted with
the idea that you can go out in the
world and it won’t crush you.” 7

Back home, he spent winters at a
private school and summers work-
ing in British Columbia’s wilderness
parks, cutting trails and ﬁghting
forest ﬁres. It was tough labor for
little pay, and it attracted people
who Couldn’t land cushier jobs—Ca-
nadian Indians and American draft
dodgers. Davis considered both
groups a refreshing change from the
uptight world of provincial Canadi-
an private schools. When one of the
draft dodgers showed him a Life
magazine cover story about a stu-
dent strike at Harvard, he studied it
avidly. This place looked like fun. He
applied for admission and, to his
surprise, he was accepted.

He arrived in 1971 with no idea
what he wanted to do with his life. “I
sort of tried on a different cloak
every two weeks,” he recalls. “It was
radical politics for a while. It was
theater for a while. It was Eastern
religion for a while.”

And for a while it was drugs.
Davis did inhale—eagerly, avidly,
often. He also took LSD and, as he
puts it, “lay prostrate before the
gates of awe.”

His psychedelic interests inspired
him to take a botany course with
Richard Evans Schultes, the legend-
ary Harvard professor ,who had
trekked through the Amazon rain
forest back in the ’40s, living with
tribal people, cataloguing their
plants and sampling their psychedel-
ic potions in shamanic rituals. Davis

was entranced. Finally, he’d found a ,

mentor and a way of life that seemed
adventurous enough to suit him.

Early in 1974, Davis walked into
Schultes’ ofﬁce and announced that
he wanted to quit schOol and explore
the Amazon. The old man looked up
from his stack of specimens and
said, “When do you want to go?”

“He had three pieces of advice,”
Davis recalls. “He said, ‘Don’t bother
with leather boots because all the
snakes bite at the neck. Don’t forget
to bring a pith helmet. And don’t
come back without tryingayahuas-
w“, ”

Ten days later, Davis was on a
ﬂight to Bogota, scribbling his ro-
mantic, bohemian goals on the ﬁrst
page of his journal: “Risk discomfort
and loneliness for understanding.
. . . Stand raw naked but that much
more aware.”

“It sounds precious,” he says, “but
at the same time, I wasprepared to
do it.”

And he did. Within a week of his
arrival, he’d talked his way onto a
biological expedition to the rain
forest in Colombia. After that, he
met a British explorer, and the two
of them got lost for 10 days in a
swamp on the Colombia-Panama
border and nearly starved to death.
Then he hooked up with Tim Plow-
man, a Schultes protege who was
studying the use of the coca plant by

mentor Richard Evans Schultes. The two traveled throughout the Andes.

the Indians. Davis and Plowman
traveled through the Andes for
months, meeting Indians who hunt-
ed threetoed sloths with blowguns,
and sojourning with a tribe that
picked its priests in infancy, kept
them isolated in darkness for 18
years of religious training, and then
released them into a world they had
never seen.

And, of course, he took Schultes’
advice and tried ayahuasca, a power-
ful hallucinogen made from a combi-
nation of Amazonian plants. The
experience was alternately nauseat.
ing, terrifying and ecstatic.

It was a year of incredible adven-
tures and he learned ﬁrsthand what
he calls the most important revela.

found Davis. . ‘
“Wade was holed up in an ofﬁce in
a back room, wearing this Mexican
tunic,” she says. “He had his ofﬁce

Beneath his exotic garb, she

sensed the heart of a searcher. “He ,

was looking for The Other,” She
says. “He was looking for the un-

. known—even the unknowable.”

He was too restless to spend
much time on campus. He kept
retuming to the Canadian Rockies

to work as) a ranch hand and a logger

and a hunting guide. In 1982,
Schultes dispatched him to Haiti to
ﬁnd the secret of the zombies. Voo-
doo priests were reported to have a
potion that put people in a trance so
deep they’d been declared dead by
Western doctors and then buried,
only to turn up alive later. Schultes
wanted Davis to find out what was
in that potion.

“I was hired on what I thought
would be a two-week lark in the
spring of 1982,” Davis says. “I had
no idea it would end up consuming
four years of my life.”

During those years, Davis im-
mersed himself in the beautiful and
terrifying world of voodoo, even

bones grilled over a ﬁre and pound-
ed into “zombie powder.” But he

, concluded that baby’s bones weren’t

the active ingredient in the zombie
potion. Instead, it was a powerful
nerve toxin found in a blowﬁsh.
Back from Haiti, Davis holed up
on Currier’s farm in The Plains, Va.;
and wrote “The Serpent and the

, Rainbow,” an account of his voodoo

adventures. When it was published in
1986, the New York Times mocked
his prose style as “overheated,” and
Science magazine disputed his phar-
macological conclusions as “unscien-

ormed Davis from an obscure,

impoverished grad student into a

 

semi-rich, semi-famous professional
writer and lecturer.

“It was an amazing period of my
life,” he says. “I was graduated from
Harvard, which had been my home
since I was 18. My father died. I split
up with my girlfriend of ﬁve years. I
met Gail, my future wife. And I
made more money than I had ever
made. I went from an annual income
of about $3 to making $500,000. It
was like winning the lottery.”

The SilVer Tongue

When you’re trekking across Ti-
bet and a blizzard dumps several feet
of snow on you and you’re forced to
wait out the storm in a tent, Wade
Davis is the guy you want to have
around. Taylor-Ide knows this. He’s
been there.

“Wade’s one of the best people to
have in the tent,” Taylor-Ide says.
“You sit around the campﬁre with
him and the hours spin by. He can
transport you with his words to
other times and places. He’s a racon-
teur, no doubt about it.”

Taylor-Ide is the president of
Future Generations, a foundation
that maintains two huge nature
preserves in the Himalayas. Davis is
one of his trustees. On a 3,000-mile
trip across Tibet, Taylor-Ide mar-
veled at Davis’s ability to befriend
the Tibetan yak herders in the
expedition.

“He would get up early and sit in
the yak herders’ tent drinking tea
instead of sitting with the Westem-
ers drinking coffee,” Taylor-Ide re
calls. “He chatted with them al-
though he doesn’t speak Tibetan or
Chinese. He gets a dialogue going
with the other senses. He’s got that
big wide smile and a lot of gestures.
Remember: He’s been in the ﬁeld
with a lot of people he couldn’t speak
with.”

His wife, Gail Percy, concurs. “He
moves effortlessly in other cultures,”
she says. “He’s very engaging with
people and very genuine with them
on their level, whatever that level
may be, whether it’s a child or an
elder.”

Percy knows how hard that is—
she spent several years as an anthro-
pologist in Tunisia before she mar-
ried Davis and settled down. “I had

 

ery of oil: “The shaman I’d once
worked with had died, and his son
had a job with Texaco.

“You keep bumping up against
the terrible spread of this generic
modern industrial world and you see
its power to crush the spirit of these
different peoples,” he says. “We
forget that when these societies are
assimilated or go extinct, you lose
whole intellectual traditions—tradi-
tions that we really don’t under-
stand. I don’t know if we can change
that, but. we have the obligation to
bear witness to it.”

Following His Nose
He’s supposed to be writing a

 

, piece for National Geographic but,

like most writers, Davis would much
rather talk than type.

Sitting in his Georgetown studio,
his tousled Michael Douglas hair
falling over his black turtleneck, he
tells stories about the places he’s
been and the people he’s met. He’s
had an interesting life, and he never

. planned any of it, he says.

“I had no idea what I was going to
do with my life,” he says. “It’s so
absurd, the pressure we put on
students in college—the panic to
enter a career trajectory. It’s one
reason why they’ re so miserable.”

He always preferred to follow his
nose, look for adventure, trust in
serendipity. “By embracing seren-
dipity, you put yourself out there
where things can happen to you,” he
says. “Part of it is having the courage
to risk the new, the willingness to
ﬂing yourself on the benevolence of
the world.” .

He did it again last month, when
he was in Kenya, working on that
story for the National Geographic.
He was visiting a tribe of nomadic
herdsmen called the Ariaal when his
hosts offered him a gourd containing
the drink that is the staple of their
diet—fresh cow’s milk mixed with
fresh cow’s blood.

“I was really squeamish,” he
says, “but it turned out to be
delicious. It was like a salty straw-
berry smoothie.”

 

traveled more than he had when we. 9 :5}; , --

met,” she says, “so I was happy to
stay at home with the children.”

The family spends winters in
Washington, where Percy grew up
and owns a house and where their
children, Tara, 10, and Raina, 7,
attend private schools. In the sum-
mers, they retreat to their hunting
lodge in northern British Columbia.
It’s a delightfully bourgeois life for a
professional adventurer, but Davis
still heads off to the bush regularly.
In the past few months he’s traveled
to Borneo and Kenya.

Percy doesn’t worry about him .

when he’s off in the wilderness. “He
knows how to move in any situa-
tion,” she says.«“I-Ie’s much better in
the wilderness than he is in the city.

He gets lost in the city, but he’s

amazing in the wilderness.”

Davis’s writing, always richly lyri-
cal, has grown darker in recent
years. Early on, he admits, his prose

was “a little breathless” in its wide- '

eyed celebration of native cultures.
Now, it has taken on a more funereal
tone as he watches those cultures

pass away. In an essay, “The End of ,

the Wild,” which appears in his new

book, he writes about returning to '

visit an Ecuadorean tribe he’d en-
countered years earlier, only to ﬁnd

 

 

its culture destroyed by the diSCOv- - ‘2=.V-2~2-=--'-:

B'll McKibben is the nation’s environmental scold, warning that the world is hurtling toward an overheated season of doom.

By MAEC FISHER
Washingto n. Post Staff Writer .

 

NEW YORK
nder the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center on a
strangely warmDecembermorn, skaters twirl on the
crowded ice, a crowd cheers the purveyors of bad news
at the NBC studios, and tourists with bulging shopping
bags bump against one another,‘excusing themselves at
every turn. There’s a smile on nearly every face.
Even Bill McKibben’ s. ‘
He bounds over to the tree, bounces on his heels and pronounces
this an “amazing day, 70 degrees 1n New York City in December!”
For a moment, he is like the rest of New York, swept up in the
holiday cheer, dazzled by the color and bustle.

 

 

But then he remembers who he is, and the jaw juts and the
concern—always, the concern—slips into his voice. He walks along

“47th Street and notes, “The people’s faces are still grim.” He recalls his

years in this city, when he wrote ‘Talk‘of the Town” pieces for the old
New Yorker, Mr. Shawn’s New Yorker, “back before it was just about
rich people.” That was back before McKibben launched his career as the
nation’s environmental scold, author of one book after another warning
that the World is hurtling toward an overheated season of doom. ‘
“The End of Nature” was the ﬁrst popular book to make a convinc-
ing caSe for global Warming And McKibben went further: Man reigns
supreme—supremely destructive, and‘ ‘nature, independent nature, is
already ended. To fight for it 1s like ﬁghting for an independent Lat-
via.” McKibben wrote this 1n 1989. A few months later, Latvia was

McKIBBEN, From E10

 

‘ Republican thinking.

And if that evangelical world-
~ View supports a little millennial-
ism—the notion that an apocalyp-
tic event is coming, presaging the

return of Jesusé—well, McKibben ,

could do without the hoopla and
hysteria surrounding the dawn of
the Third Millennium, but he has
. to admit that his Own views ﬁt
rather neatly with other. scenarios
of deem.

“Actually,” he says, “I’m sur-
prised the world hasn’t gotten
even crazier as we approach the
millennium.”

Let’s see: war, impeachment,
worldwide econOmic strain, terror-
ism, fundamentalist upheavals,
widespread panic over the possibil-
ity of a devastating break in com-
merce and the power grid when
the Year 2000 computer bug kicks
in. Not crazy. endugh?

But all this 18 external stuff, and
what mest interests and worries

McKibben is the internal, the fault .

that lies within each of us.

In fact, the Christmas book is
something of a departure for
McKibben. He takes pride in his
ability to stick to the big picture. “I
don’t write those ‘It’s time to put a

brick in your toilet to save the .

world’ books,” he says with consid-
erable derision.

Though he does have a brick 1n
his toilet.

In fact, “Hundred Dollar Holi—
day” is in many ways. the ultirnate
McKibben big-picture book. The
excesses of Christmas are “a pow-
. erful metaphor for some of the
ways we might ﬁnally decide to
change,” he says. Then, sheepish-
1y: “Admittedly, it’s a long shot.”

But McKibben believes many
)BOplE are ready to cut and sand

heir own wooden blocks, to make :1

their children their own alphabet
books, to give presents of time,

attention and whimsy instead of '

Mattel, Sega and Gap

Wouldn’t $100 holidays throw
thousands out of wOrk? Isn’t the
Iwhole shebang based on continued

consumption? Nah, McKibben

says; we could boost our savings
rate, and anyway, check out the
Asian economic crisis. That, he
says, is a gift, the most impOrtant

step the world has taken toward '

saving nature by reducing con-
sumption

"McKibben is at pains to con- -

Vince a listener that he is no
. Scrooge, no sourpuss. “You can
feel the palpable joy in a new doll, "a
new toy as the kids get their gifts,”
he says. He reminds a visitor, over

and over, that he loves to get a ,

present.

But he Can’t stop himself: “Past
‘ the age of 9, there are very few
people who are orgasmic about the
pile of gifts. I don’t think an end-
less pursuit of accumulation is a.
necessary part of our nature.”

McKibben cites a study that
found that more than 80 percent of
Americans‘would prefer to receive
a picture album of their youth over
anything available in a store.

At the McKibben house next '

week, the family will exchange
presents they made themselves. In
past years, MCKibben has made
. bagels, sausages (chicken, of
course),'walking sticks and soap to
_ give as presents. He provides his
daughter with wOoden toys in-
stead of plastic or electronic ones.
And on Christmas morning, the
McKibbens will “wander the ﬁelds
’ and forests, scattering grain and

seed” to ease the day fOr the birds '

and beasts.
For all his writing about silence
2 and Solitude, for all his little digs at
the city, McKibben claims to love
:he possibilities of city life. It is,
rather, the suburbs from which he
, feels a compulsion to ﬂee. That
faceless place where he grew up—

Lexington, Mass, to be exaetw

that place “where things are so
oriented aroundyou.’

And so McKibben changed him-

self. He became a woodsman,a
writer, an observer of small things.

And a believer, a subscriber to the .

notion that this is man’s last
chance, the last moment in which
we can halt our evil ways and
return to the simplicity of wilder-
ness and nature.

McKibben rejects~ science’s'

claim to haVe harnessed man’s
imagination as a tool to make our
lives longer, more efﬁcient and
perhaps someday less abusive of
the planet’ s resources. He rejects
the concept of biotechnology as a
path toward replenishing some of
what man has taken from the
Earth.

Yes, McKibben says, man has
always, found a way to adapt. Yes,
centuries of predictions of popula-

A message from DWAA President, Mordecai Siegal

The best known aspect of DWAA is our annual writing competition. This. competition is meant to
encourage quality writing about dogs, their rearing, training, care and all aspects of companionship,
including the dynamic sport of dog shows. Recognition for quality writing includes the prized ‘Maxwell”
medallions for ﬁrst place in each category as well as cash grants for many of the special awards The
competition is open to all writers, photographers, editors, and publishers, whether they are members of
DWAA or not. The awards banquet has become one of the premier satellite events of the wonderful
Westminster weekend

For those of you who are not members of DWAA (and I hope that you will join us; over 500 strong) you
probably do not know that the Dog Writers Association of America came into existence on February 13‘“,
1935, at approximately 4:35pm, as the Westminster Dog Show was winding down for the day. Thirty
writers, editors and publishers were invited to the ﬁrst meeting Much has happened since then, not the
least of which is this ﬁne organization.

I wish to welcome you all here tonight to this time-honored event and thank you for being here, for entering
- our competition, and for lending your enthusiastic support. You, the writers, are the reason we are gathered
here tonight. You, the nominees for the 1998 DWAA Writing Competition, are gathered here in this
attractive ballroom of the Southgate Hotel to give recognition and to be recognized yourselves for your
outstanding efforts in behalf of all dogs everywhere. Let us never lose sight of the dogs; think kind
thoughts of those magniﬁcent creatures that have given us all so very much.

Allow me to congratulate each and every one of you for your good work You are all winners in every
way. Please enjoy your evening

Sincerely,
Mordecai
