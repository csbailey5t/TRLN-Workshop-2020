Into the drowsy stillness, which had settled upon the Wide, main street of a country
town, one afternoon in mid-summer, drifted the monotonous strains of a hand—organ,
which knew but one tune. On the porch of a comfortable house shaded by ﬁne, old trees,
a little group of girls had gathered round a table and were sewing, while Marion Johnson,
a cousin who was visiting them, read aloud.

“Why, I do believe 1” she exclaimed, laying aside her book and listening attentively,

“It is the very same man who came to our town a week ago, with such a miserable looking.

little monkey he called J'ocko. It seemed very tired, and Mother thought it was sick and
gave him money and his dinner, so that he would let it rest for a while and we could feed it.

“Later, the Williams children, who live out in the suburbs and belong to my Band
of Mercy, saw them, and heard the man speak very sharply to the monkey, which seemed
to be terribly frightened and not to know what he wished it to do. Then the organ~grinder
grew very angry and dragged the poor little creature into the woods and beat it cruelly. The
children heard its pitiful cries and ran in search of our humane ofﬁcer, but by the time they
found him, the man had disappeared. I think I’ll ask Aunt Kate to come out,” she added,
rising and going into the house.

When she returned it was with this warm-hearted relative, who could always be
depended upon to lend a helping hand to any human being, or dumb creature. needing a
friend. Her face lost its usual expression of placid good humor, as she walked to the
railing of the front porch, and saw‘on the sidewalk below, a tall, robust man leisurely turn—
ing the handle of a small organ, while a small, weak monkey, with dull, sunken eyes and
hollow cheeks. begged for pennies, and danced very wearily, with slow, lagging steps in
obedience to the sharp jerking of a chain attached to the stiff band of leather he wore
around his neck. A cap was held on his head by a piece of tight rubber passing under the
chin, and his gaudy dress was heavy and warm and weighed down his tired limbs. Now

and then. as he dared, Jocko laid a tiny, brown hand on the torturing chain, in an effort.

to ease the pain it was causing, and glanced appealing at his master as if trying to make
him understand how it was cutting his thin neck, but to this the man paid no heed, and
the merciless jerking continued.

Aunt Kate’s mild blue eyes came very near ﬂashing as she motioned the stout organ—
grinder to stop playing. “You no lika museec?” he said brokenly, glancing up at her in
some surprise. “Yes, that is right,” she answered, speaking very slowly and distinctly, in
order that the foreigner should grasp her meaning fully. “We do NOT like the music,

“and we do NOT like to see the monkey dance. and we do NOT like to see him take. off his
,/ cap, and above all we do NOT like to see you hurting his neck by pulling that chain.” A
,‘ look of sullen anger came over the man’s face, and he prepared to move on, but recon-
~ sidered and sat down on the porch steps, when he saw a coin in the lady’s hand, which she

promised him and food also, if he would allow the monkey to rest for an hour.

Jocko eyed the man apprehensively at ﬁrst, scarcely believing that he might rest his

aching muscles and tired feet, but understanding at length that nothing further was required

. of him just then, threw himself at full length upon the porch ﬂoor, as some wornout child
5 might have done.

Marion was then left on guard to see that he was not disturbed, while the others went
indoors to prepare food. On returning, they found Jocko resting on a porch cushion, a
comfort which his emaciated body had never before known. ’With considerable difﬁculty,
and only after being promised an additional coin, had the organ-grinder permitted Marion
to remove Jocko’s hard, leather collar, beneath which she had detected sores, in order that
she might bandage the, small, wasted neck with soft linen and salve, during which he had
looked on contemptuously at her work of mercy. The cap, with its cutting rubber band,
had also been laid aside.

When water was brought to him, Jocko drank it with pitiful eagerness and milk also,
for many hours had passed since his parched throat and dry lips had been moistened.
x. Then, never quite comfortable or at ease, and with anxious, troubled eyes glancing con—
“2 tinually in the direction of the organ—grinder (plainly showing that he feared punishment

" if by any chance he offended him) he ate, much as some wild, starving creature might have

done, a bountiful meal, such as he had never before seen.

Marion J'ohnson’s sensitive face was quivering with repressed feeling, and the hearts
of both aunt and niece were sore, and their eyes dim with unshed tears when, the purchased
hour of rest having expired, they stood alone upon the porch. In the distance the slouch-
ing, heavily—built ﬁgure of the organ-grinder was disappearing, carrying beyond their reach
the helpless little slave, which was dying by inches in his hard, cruel hands.

“What a dreadful man,” said Marion, breaking the silence. “There seemed to be noth-
ing to which one could appeal. I tried to ﬁnd a soft side to his nature while you were.
indoors, but failed utterly. Then, h0ping to touch the selﬁsh side, I said how much better
the monkey could dance, and how many more pennies it would bring him, if he gave it
plenty of food and water, and let it rest when tired, but he listened to all with equal indif-
ference, yet I saw by the expression of his face that he quite understood my meaning.”

“I cannot imagine what the societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals are think-
ing of to allow such things to go on,” answered Aunt Kate indignantly. “If this is not
cruelty—then I should like to know what cruelty is. Of all the means by which lazy people
make the world yield them an easy living, could there be any more contemptible and dis-
creditable than this, which we have just seen?”

“Your Uncle James,” she added, “once made a careful study of the methods by which
animals are trained to do unnatural and very foolish tricks, such as leaping through hoops
of ﬁre, and from great heights, etc., many of them causing them the greatest fear. I have
heard him say that the whole thing, from beginning to end, is hideously cruel, and that if
the public only knew what went on behind the scenes it would boycott such exhibitions, and
the theatres, etc., which give them. This would soon bring the wretched business to an
end, as there would then be no money in it. Have you read The Animal Trainer, by Alice
J. Cleator? It is excellent; I can give you a copy to use as a Band of Mercy lesson if you
would like to have it. Children are usually attracted by trained animals, being ignorant of
the cruelty involved, and should be carefully instructed in this very important branch of
humane education. Part of the poem runs like this—

--

“Listen, look! If not, there are but few who would not moan
he whip. descends, as from the arena’s rear _ To gaze upon the cruel punishment,
Leaps into line a crowd of animals, When trainer‘ with his pupil is alone.
Whose eyes are piteous with the light of fear. Ah, these poor pupils mastered by the whip!
* * * * * * * God never meant them for a life like this.
The dogs got gaily dancing round the ring, Kind Pity, sweep such scenes as these from earth,
But, oh, the pathos could one see their eyes! And turn the loud applause to scathing hiss!”

For tricks well done the Judas-kiss is given,

“The custom of keeping collections of caged, wild animals in various places, for the
entertainment of old and young is another great source of cruelty, which in Christian
countries, at least, should have been ended long ago,” continued Aunt Kate, going on with
a subject which was of deep interest to both. “There is no educationalside to it, as knowl—
edge cannot be acquired by standing for a few minutes before a wild creature which has
been placed in utterly unnatural surroundings, and looking at it through the bars of a cage.
On the contrary, very much may be learned by studying the wealth of literature that has
been written on the subject, and by pictures, charts, models, etc. When the animal is used,
it should always be the mounted specimen, never the living one, which suffers unspeakably
in captivity, and from having been trapped, also from changes of climate, and from having
been transported long distances by sea and land, often suffering for food and water, and
always at the\best, being very scantily fed.

Strengthened by food and rest, cheered by the unaccustomed kindness he had received,
and with the soft linen bandage protecting the sores on his neck, Jocko had responded with
more activity than for some time past to the commands of the organ-grinder, bringing him
in such a rich harvest, that it was late that night before he was locked into a close, stuffy

broken and restless. Now, he is living over that all too quickly passing hour upon the shady

You say dogs are speechless? His eyes are a

And if dull of learning, 0 pitying skies,

NO ALICE JEAN CLEATOR.

Mrs. Jennie Weller, President of the Hillsbo-rough
County, Florida, Humane Society, tells of an effec-
tive method of dealing with the organ grinder evil:

“I am pleased to tell you that in December, 1915,
our society addressed the Iayor and City Council
of Tampa, in the form of a Resolution, pointing out
the cruelties of the “Monkeyman,” and the fact that
he was a “Vagrant” under the law, and asked that
they repeal the then existing ordinance, which au-
thorized street performances, and that “all such
exhibitions herein mentioned, be prohibited for all
time to come, within the domain of our City.”
There was no protest; the resolutions passed on
ﬁrst reading, and great wase our joy. I used fre.
quently to have the monkeys “arrested,” that they
might have needed rest. One rosecution of the
“man” resulted in a- scathing re uke by our muni-
cipal judge, and ﬁning the “grinder” $25.00 or 30
days in jail. It was immediately following this
prosecution that our resolutions were presented and
adopted and Tampa freed.”

BEN HAZZARD’S GUESTS

From the C ongregmtionalist.
Ben Hazzard’s but was smoky and cold,
Ben Hazzard, half blind, was black and old,
And he cobbled shoes for his scanty gold.
Sometimes he sighedefor a larger store
Wherewith to bless the wandering poor;
For he was not wise in worldly lore;
The poor were Christ’s; he knew no more.
One night a cry from the window came——
Ben Hazzard was sleepy and tired and lame»-
“Ben Hazzard, open,’ it seemed to say,
“Give shelter and food, I humbly pray.”
Ben Hazzard lifted his woolly head _
To listen. “ ’Tis awful cold,” he said,
And his old bones shook in his ragged bed,
“But the wanderer must be comforted.” _
“Come in, in the name of the Lord,” .he cried,
As he opened the door, and held. it Wide,
A milk-white kitten was all he spied.
Ben Hazzard, amazed, stared up and down;
The stout house doors were carefully shut,
Safe bolted were all but old Ben’s hut. .
“I thought that somebody called,” he said,
“So-me dream or other got into my head!
Come then, poor pussy, and share my bed.”
Then out from the storm, the wind and the sleet
Puss joyfully lay at old Ben’s feet.
Truly, it was a. terrible storm,
IKen feared he should never more be warm.
But just as he began to be dozy,
And puss was pur'ring soft and cozy,
A voice called faintl before his door:
“Ben Hazzar'd, Ben Plazzard, help, I implore!
Give drink, and a crust from out your store.”
Out from his bed he stumbled again; .
“Come in, in the name of the Lord,” he said;
“With such as I have, thou shalt be fed.”
Only a little black dog he saw,

hining and shaking a broken paw.
“Well, well,” he cried, “I must have dreamed;

But verily like a voice it seemed.
Poor creature,” he added, with husky tone,
“Thou shalt have the whole of my marrow bone.”
He went to the cupboard, and took from the shelf
The bone he had saved for his very self.
Then, after binding the broken paw,
Half dead with cold went back to his straw.
Under the ancient blue bedquilt he crept,
His conscience was: white and again he slept.
But again, a voice called, both loud and clear:
“Ben. Hazzard, for Christ’s sweet sake come here!”
Once more he stood at the open door,
And looked abroad, as he looked before.
This time, full sure, ’twas a voice he heard:
But all that he saw was a storm-tossed bird.
“Come in, in the name of the Lord,” he said
Tenderly raising the drooping head,
nd, tearing his tattered robe apart,
Laid the cold bird on his own warm heart.

,

The sunrise ﬂashed on the snowy thatch,
As an angel lifted the wooden latch.
Ben woke in a, ﬂood of golden light,
And knew the voice that had called all night.
“Thrice happy is he that blesseth the poor.
The humblest creature that sought thy door,
For Christ’s sweet sake tho-u hast comforted.”
“Nay, ’twas not much,” Ben humbly said,
With a ruefuf shake of his old gray head.
“Who giveth all of his scanty store
In Christ’s dear name, can do no more.
Behold, the Master who waiteth for thee,
Saith: ‘Giving to them thou hast given to Me.’ ”
Then, with heaven’s light on his face, “Amen,
I come in the name of the Lord,” said Ben.
“Frozen to death,” the watchman said,
When at last he found him in his bed,

ith a smile on his face so strange and bright;
He wondered what old Ben saw that night.

WHAT IS THE JACK LONDON CLUB \(

With Its 200,000 Members in Three Years?

This Club was formed to put an end to one of the worst forms of existing cruelty
——the training of trick animals. Jack London’s “Michael Brother of Jerry” is an
exposition of cruelty connected with this business. He says: “No normal healthy
human would tolerate such performances did he or she know the terrible cruelty that
lies behind them and makes them possible."

He says there is one way to stop it. When humane men and women and children
will get up and leave the theater during one of these animal turns, returning to their seats
when it is over, the Management will know these performances are not wanted and will
cease catering them to the public. -

All you have to do to join the Club is to send your name to Our Dumb Animals,

180 Longwood Ave., Boston, Massachusetts. That means you will make this silent
yet powerful protest.

READ JACK LONDON’S “MICHAEL BROTHER OF JERRY”

it? N.B. We want each reader to secure as many members as possible and send us the

number of those signifying their willingness to join this Club. Now is your chance if you
really desire to do something for animals.

We will supply copies of the book at $1.00 each, postpaid. We will send the “Foreword”

free to any asking for it. A copy of the book free as a prize for three one-dollar

Dear Dr. Rowley: ~

My wife and I are most anxious to become members of the Jack London Club. We
have experienced many unhappy moments while being compelled to watch trained-animal
exhibitions, and it only needs a pledge of this kind to give us the courage to go through
the ordeal of “making ourselves conspicuous” by leaving our seats. After all, it will be a
very slight tax upon our sensibilities, compared with the agony of mind and body that
the poor animals have gone through. Believe me,

Yours respectfully,
(Signed) GEORGE ARLISS

My dear Dr. Rowley: N—

I am heartily in sympathy with this effort of the Jack London Club to suppress a
form of cruelty too little recognized. Count me among its members.

“THE ARGUMENT OF LEGS”

A California friend has issued a leaﬂet on behalf of the Club with the above title.
Getting up and going out is an argument stronger than words. In this leaﬂet is this
paragraph:—

A book of instruction for trainers tells the performer to ﬁnd out what is the most
tender part of the animal selected for “education,” in order to strike or spear that part
in training. If it is the nose, the animal is attacked in the nose, or dragged by the nose.
If it is the back, that part is hurt until the animal will dodge in any given direction to
avoid the hurt. In the case of elephants, the feet are extremely sensitive. Therefore
the_training of elephants is accompanied by hurting the feet.
