I realize thast more serious

matters confront the world today?

—. but I feel compelled to comment
on the unnecessary death of the
Audubon Zoo rhino, Jessie,
whose horn was removed simply
because it was thwarting the
male rhino’s attempts to breed.

The Times-Picayune reported

that zoo ofﬁcials were “eager for
her to breed” because she “was
nearing the end of her reproduc-
’ live life.”
What a barbaric method to fa-
wilitate breeding, when there was
- no guarantee that removal of this
particular rhino’s horn would re-
sult in her acceptance of the
male!

Breeding-is part of the preser-
vation of the species, but risking
a valuable animal’s life for that
purpose is in conflict with the
aim of preservation. If”'this fe-
male had been in the wild, she
,would have continued to thwart
. the male’s advances. Perhaps, for
some reason nature did not
intend for her to breed, or she
“was too advanced in age.

Maybe she was a “late
bloomer”- and would have suc-
cumbed to the male rhino’s
' advances next year, but now we’ll
never know.

rhino death at zoo

The purpose of a zoo should be
to present animals in their natu-
ral form in their natural habitat
(Audubon had improved dramati-
cally in this respect) and to allow
them to live as naturally as possi-
ble in a conﬁned zoo environ-
ment.

If a zoo animal cannot be pro-
tected from such unnatural and
cruel treatment, the zoos should
not be in existence or the
judgment of the zoo ofﬁcials who
make such decisions should be
questioned.

Was the possibility of any
other alternative explored? What
other “alterations” are made to-
zoo animals?

In the wild, rhinos are butch-
ered because of their horns; how
ironic that, in captivity, where it
is supposed to be protected, one
unfortunate rhino has in a way
suffered the same fate, albeit for
a supposedly different reason.

Now there is one less rhino in
existence. I and other members
of my family visit the Audubon
Zoo during the year, but doubt
that future visits will be as fre—
quent for some time to come,
particularly when visiting the
rhino exhibit will be such a grim
reminder.

According to Eugene J. Bar-
:ousse (Letters, Nov. 12), hunting,
which was once considered a
“sport,” now comes under the
category of entertainment.

I can’t perceive it to be either a
'sport (where’s the fairness?) or
entertainment (where’s the fun?),
but then I, who used to be called
a “bleeding heart,” am now called
an “animal-rights terrorist.”

Having read “The Dream of
the Earth” by Thomas Berry, an
ecologist of spiritual inclination, I
was moved by the comparison
between Berry’s viewpoint and
that of Mr. Barousse.

Berry writes of creating “even
a new sense of what it is to be
human. It is to transcend not
only our national limitations but
even our species isolation, to
enter into the larger community
.of l1Ving species. This brings
about a completely new sense of

"

C es
e/CﬂYUA/C

reality and of value.”

He then speaks of “the change
of consciousness that is'needed”
and adds, “the human is non-vi-
able in the present mode of patri-
archal functioning.”

I found these thoughts such a

contrast to those of the hunter,

still functioning in a “patriarchal
mode” and existing in “species
isolation.

I doubt Mr. Barousse and
others of the hunting community
even understand these concepts,
but I hope someday they will and
that we as a species evolve to
that point when, to quote Berry
again, the human itself becomes
“an integral member of the Earth
and not some lordly being free to
plunder the Earth for human
utility.”

These are concepts for the fu-
ture if we are to survive as a spe-
cies and as a planet. '4

“A. Volk resorted to a tactic peo-

Ms. Volk did not support her

you don’t understand. The truth
is, rejection of an argument is not
the same as not understanding it.

Although her dream of a

and mankind live side by side
would be nice, it is only feasible
in a world where all animals live
in cages. The survival of the ani-
mal World lies in a joint effort by
protectionists and hunters.

whitetail deer, need well regu-
lated hunting seasons to protect

them from the ravages of disease
and starvation. _ ,

Animal populations do not reg-
ulate themselves until they have
well exceeded the carrying capac-
ity of the land. That is the point
where starvation, disease and a
general decline in the quality of
the species occurs.

Domestic animals face this
problem even when controlled by
man. A quick call to any animal
pound will shOw how many cats
and dogs are euthanized every
year despite birth control efforts

by man. Unless you can ﬁnd a

way to impose effective birth
control on wildlife, some species
will suffer tremendously without
management by hunting.

I would also like to dispel the
concept instilled by the media

. that the peopl‘e who set marsh

ﬁres to shoot animals, shoot over
the limit on ducks and shoot out
of season are hunters. These are
outlaws —- criminals who are
dealt with by the law.

Just because they shoot ani-
mals does not mean they are
hunters. Every hunter I know re-
sents having poachers put in the
same class as hunters.

Finally, the majority of the

 

expenditures made to purchase
and maintain wildlife area lands

come from sportsmen, although

these areas are open to the
public. ' .

Of the $39 million budgeted for
the Louisiana Department of
Wildlife and Fisheries this year,
approximately $14 million has
come directly from. hunting and
ﬁshing fees and licenses. The fed- .
eral government matches those
funds with money collected from
federal waterfowl stamps, taxes
on guns and ammunition and
other hunting and ﬁshing related
revenues. .

Of the $9 million remaining, it
would be fairly safe to assume
that hunting and ﬁshing related .
expenditures by the public (such
as taxes on boats, hunting cloth-
ing, gasoline used in transporta-
tion in those activities, etc.)
generate at least that much.

Hunters are just as dedicated
to seeing wildlife ﬂourish as pro-
tectionists are. Maybe instead of
bashing each other, both groups
should listen to the wildlife bi-
ologists and realize that there’s a
time and place for everything:
protectionism and hunting.

LSU dOctor: .
Research sna
threatens lives

 

By BRUCE ALPERT
Washington bureau

 

WASHINGTON —.The phy-

sician who has conducted cat- ‘2

shooting experiments in New
Orleans said Thursday that con:

tinued suspension of the Con- ,
troversial medical research into

head wounds is jeopardizing
human lives.

“I watched the mobilization in-
the (Persian) Gulf, and am
enraged my research has been
held up,” Dr. Michael E. Carey of
Louisiana State University Medi-
cal School said at a news confer-
ence. “By delaying our research,
how many extra deaths may the
animal activists have caused, how

much extra suffering, how much -

disability, how many human lives
have they harmed and how many
families destroyed?”

Carey, joined by representa-
tives ,of the American Medical
Association and Other health care
organizations, accused the Gen-
eral Accounting Ofﬁce, the inves-
tigatory arm of Congress, of
bowing to pressure from groups
opposed to animal research.

The GAO, in a report released
last week, criticized the proce-
dures used in administering gen-
eral anesthesia in the cat-
shooting experiments, which are
sponsored by a $2 million Army

grant. But it suggested that the'

Army decide whether to resume
the research, suspended in No-
vember 1989 by congressional
mandate after complaints that it
was inhumane and ineffective.

Carey, who has directed the re-
search since its inception in 1983,
offered an emotional defense of
the work, which has included the
ﬁring of pellets into 700 anesthe—
tized cats. About 125 cats a year
were used in the experiments.

“These 125 anesthetized cats
must be compared to the 10 mil-
lion cats- destroyed in pounds
yearly and the 16,000 Americans
who die if brain wounds yearly

labo-

sponse to criticism of his project.
Carey said the research is'

driven by his experience as a neu-

rosurgeon during the Vietnam

_.-.- --_.'_—....._-—.._ -...—_.

War. He said the treatment was
no more advanced than it was
during World War 11.

“Not three blocks from here

stands the Vietnam Memorial,”

Carey said. “Every other name
on that monument died in
ground combat of a brain wound.
Now, when you look at the Viet-
nam monument, you see a name.
When I look at a name, I still
hear a voice saying, ‘Help me
doc.’ ”

Dr. M. Roy Schwartz, senior
vice president of the American
Medical Association, said the
GAO report was unfair because it
did not let Carey explain his re—
search directly to two medical
panels that evaluated the work.

“We think it (the GAO) was
biased when it started,” Schwartz
said. “We think it was biased
when it was conducted and we
think it was biased in the way it
came out.”

Dr. John Jane, a neurosurgeon
at the University: of Virginia
Medical Center and chairman of
one of the medical panels, said
his group wouldn’t have ques-
tioned Carey’s anesthesia tech-
niques if it had been privy to the
doctor’s subsequent explanations.

“I don’t think that there is
anything that needs to be done
(differently) because in fact had
we had access to Dr. Carey we
would have known he was doing
what we would have approved of
entirely,” Jane said.

The GAO has denied it was bi- .

ased in favor of animal-rights ac-
tivists. “GAO believes that both
the process used to conduct its
review and the concerns raised
are valid,” the agency said in its

; report.

and ~the American—'soldiers who
may need thetype of research on
brain wounds which my . ”
ratory was designed to prov1de,

Carey said in his ﬁrst detailed re-

Carey, Mic is on active duty as
a neurosurgeon assigned to a
medical unit recently called up
for possible Mideast duty,
pleaded with the Army to let him
proceed with the research, which
has produced a scientiﬁc paper
suggesting that brain-injured

, people might spontaneously re-

sume breathing long after they
stopped breathing unassisted.
But Carey said more work is
needed to test a promising exper-
imental drug for head wounds, as
well as other potential treat-
ments. Asked how much longer

the experiments should continue,
Carey said, “years.”

r—i

 

In its report, the GAO said
that if the Army decides the re-
search will “produce additional
useful information,” it should

continue the project, but only

after deﬁciencies cited by a group
of veterinary anesthesiologists

' are corrected. The anesthesiolog-

ists suggested that improper ad-
ministration of anesthesia.
threatened the reliability of re-
search data. ‘

Both Carey and Schwartz of
the AMA strongly disputed the
ﬁndings. Nevertheless, Carey said
he does not want to be “rigid,”
and “will do anything to improve
our experiments.”

The Army has given no timeta-
ble for deciding whether to re-
sume the LSU research. But Rep.
Bob Livingston, R-La., who re-
quested the GAO study, said the
Army must offer “compelling rea-
sons” if it decides to continue the
research or risk being overruled
by Congress.

Dr. Neal Barnard, president of
the Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine, said Con-
gress should permanently stop
the “wasteful, cruel and gro-
tesque” research.

“What Carey has pointed out i

rightly is that head injury is a
very serious condition,” said Bar-
nard, whose group has opposed
most animal research. “What he‘
hasn’t proven is that he has done
anything useful that stems the
tide.” . . ~

Red meat linked

. BOSTON — Meat lovers who
eat beef, pork or lamb every day
are more than twice as likely to
get colon cancer as those who
shun red meat, but switching to
ﬁsh and chicken reduces the risk,
according to a major new study.

...__ ,v- __.s-———-_

Experts have long suspected
that the fat in red meat contrib-
utes to heart disease and cancer.
But proving the cancer link has
been difficult, in part because
there have been few large, care-
fully controlled studies of the
question.

The latest research, conducted
on 88,751 women, provides some
of the strongest evidence yet that
eating lots of red meat does
indeed contribute to at-least one
form of cancer. ‘-

 

“Moderate red meat intake is

certainly better than large
amounts, but it’s 9111121: possrble
that no red meat mta e 1s.even
better,”.said Dr. Walter Willett,
who directed the study at Brig-
ham and Women’s Hospital 1n
Boston. ‘

Dr. Peter Greenwald of the
National Cancer Institute said
the study “adds to the ,ev1dence
of a risk of dietary fat, but he

cautioned against interpreting it
to "mean people should stop eat-
ing red meat entirely.

“Meat has important nutrient
value,” he said. “I would be care!
ful about a recommendation that
takes out from our diet a lot of
important nutrients. The mes—
sage. should be to cut down, not
to cut out.”

Colon cancer is the third lead—
ing cancer killer, after lung and
breast cancer. An estimated 110,-
000 new US. cases will be diag-
nosed this year.

The research was based on a
follow-up between 1980 and 1986
of the health and eating habits
of nurses across the country.
During that time, 150 of the
women studied got colon cancer.

\

 

Althoﬁal aTthe participants ‘
were women, the researchers
said their conclusions probably
apply to men.

Dr. David Hurt, a nutritionist
with the National Livestock and
Meat Board in Chicago, noted
that beef is 27 percent leaner"

. and pork is 31 percent leaner

than in 1986, when the statistics
were gathered.
“I don’t see how these num-

. bers can relate to today’s situ-

ation,” he said. “Meat today is
not the same as it was then.”

women who ate beef, pork or

ate meat between once a month

were significantly associated
with higher risk. However,

women who ate skinless chicken, '.
every day had only about half as

much risk as those who almost
never ate chicken.

Diets high in vegetable fats
were not linked with cancer. Nei-
ther were whole milk, cheese and
ice creamwwhich are other
sources of animal fat.

Many specialists believe that
eating too little fiber also con-
tributes to colon cancer, but the
study found no strong link be-
tween low ﬁber and cancer.

Dog Takes Sniff Test 1

'1'

For, D.C. School Board

 

By Marc Fisher

Washington Post Staff Writer

 

A Labrador retriever named Sam
sniffed his way through-the offices
of the DC. school board yesterday
as a demonstration for officials con-
sidering using dogs to sniff for
- drugs in student lockers.

Board member Phyllis Etheridge
Young (At Large) invited Sam and

his trainer to the board chambers to-

sniff for contraband—gunpowder in
this case, because having illegal
drugs in the school building would be
unseemly. The cream-colored dog
jumped and ran about the room,
checking the odors of identical en-
velopes containing garlic, lollipops,
teabags and The Substance. Sam got
his mark—and a cookie as reward——
every time.

“I have really been educated,” said
Young, who last month proposed us-
ing dogs after Howard County
schools approved canine searches.
“The rights of the majority are being
infringed upon whenever there are
drugs in the schools. The whole in-
tention of this plan is to protect the
rights of students and employes to a
hassle-free environment.”

Trainer Debby Kay, whose Vir-
ginia company teaches drug-search
and guide dogs, assured an audience
- of school administrators they had
nothing to fear from Sam. School
system headquarters had been
abuzz with mock jitters all day, as
staffers ribbed one another about
cleaning out their desks. But Sam,
trained to detect cocaine, marijua-

na, hashish and heroin, searches
only where he is told and he never

attacks people, Kay said.

“He’s about as ferocious as a gold-
fish,” said Walter Bastian, spokesman
for the dog training company.

Still, Sam unnerves some people.
WhenKay took a dog into one com-
pany office and the dog got interest-
ed in oneworker’s desk, the worker
“came over and sprayed aerosol de-
odorant all over the dog,” she said.

After 12 weeks of Pavlovian con-
ditioning, Sam finds what he’s look-
ing for. Sam can find drugs in lock-
ers. He can detect the odor of drugs
in a coat that held the stuff weeks

or even months before—a potential

problem in schools, where dogs
might identify lockers where a dif-
ferent student once kept drugs.
“That’s one of the issues we’ll have
to look at,” Young said.

Young has asked the administra-
tion to report by May on the feasi-
bility of three ways to use dogs:
only when no students are in the
building, only when hallways are
clear and students are in class, or at

the beginning of the day as students f;

enter the building.

 

 

“We’re getting a very positive i.

reaction to the idea,” she said. “Our
students want a drug-free environ-
ment. Now we’re waiting to hear
about the legal issues.”

School board counsel George Mar- é .
golies said courts have approved the E “~11
right of government to search lock

ers, but the law is less certain on

seizure of drugs. “We’re researching

those issues now,” he said.

To the Editor:

Los Angeles has experienced a
steady annual decline in the number
of dogs and cats handled in city shel-
ters since 1971, when it instituted a
low-cost spay-neuter program for
owned pets and animals adopted
from its shelters.

But since 1981, when Los Angel-es
repealed an ordinance that sent ani-
mals from city shelters to laborato-
ries for experimentation, the number
of animals brought in by owners and
rescuers has for the first time in a
decade increased. That strongly sup-
ports John Kullberg of the A.S.P.C.A.
(letter, March 21), who says, “forcing
shelters to sell unwanted pets to labo-
ratories encourages abandonment, in
the long run aggravating the overpop-

Pit bull’s F
E By Howard Pankratz ' . .
Denver Post Staff Writer ' '

The owner of a pit bull terrier that fatally

- mauled a 3-year-old Denver boy last October was

found guilty Friday night of violating three city

ordinances.

' Gilbert Troncosa appeared to sway on his feet-

T as Denver County ‘Judge Brian Campbell an-

nounced that the jury had found him in violation of

the city’s vicious/dog, licensing and vaccination or-
dinances. ‘ . ' , ,
Campbell warned Troncosa that he may be sent
to jail because this is the third attack by one of
'l‘roncosa’s dogs. Sentencing is scheduled in April.
_ Troncosa faces a potential $999 fine and 180 days
in jail on eaCh charge. - ,

_ 'Troncosa’s'pit bull terrier Missy saVagely at-
tacked Fernando Salazar after the tot wandered
into Troncosa’s yard at 1099 S. Dale Court about 5
pm. on Oct. 26, 1986. - '

Assistant City Attorney Tom Moe said the
youngster may have been attracted by the dog, by
swings in 'l‘roncosa’s backyard, or by a small por-
table swimming pool in the home’s carport.

A bewildered Troncosa said afterwards that he
was, surprised by the verdict. .

Troncosa denied from the witness stand Friday
that he was in any way responsible for what hap-

owner g

uilty or 3charges  _

pened to the youngster. ‘ . ..
' He said the dog belonged to his wife, that he had
posted warnings about the dog around the outside '
of the home, and that the dog was kept on a short
chain in a secluded part of the yard. ~

g “The dog was in a secluded area and no onehad
any business being there,” Troncosa told the jury.

Anthony Worth, one of Troncosa’s lawyers, told
the jury that if Troncosa was found guilty, it would

.make all dog owners in Denver potential crimi

nals. , ,
“Everybody who owns a dog in Denver is in
danger of being a criminal if their dog bites or
attacks, even if they are not there,” said Worth.
But Moe said that Troncosa was fully responsi-
ble for what happened.

He said that police and animal control ofﬁcials "

who responded to the scene saw no warning signs
posted, although they found one lying on the
ground near the dog house. ' /"' »

To establish Gilbert Troncosa’s ownership, Moe
introduced a statement from his wife Phyllis in
which she stated that the couple had two pit bull
terriers. . - ' .

“We kept Skeeter by the front door of the house
and Missy in the back,” she said. “We had them
for our protection. We always kept the dogs on
chains.” . , 4 , . ,

Dog laws

get new
impetus

By Peter Johnson

' USA TODAY

Prompted by reports of un-
provoked attacks and deaths

5 by pit bull terriers, states and

cities are sponsoring tough new

‘ laws on dangerous dogs.

Ten states — Oregon, Wash-
ington, California, New York,
Texas, Michigan, Louisiana,
Georgia, Maryland and Arkan-
sas — are considering laws to

, control dogs or punish owners

who don’t.

Rhode Island last year
passed the ﬁrst statewide get-
tough law — allowing ofﬁcials
to kill dogs involved in unpro-
voked attacks and ﬁne owners.

Nationally, 35 towns and cit-
ies have laws or are consider-
ing them. Pit bulls killed seven
in 1986, three so far this year.

New laws are proposed
“whenever there’s a very seri-
ous or fatal attack,” said the
Humane Society’s Randall
Lockwood.

Latest attacks: A retired sur-
geon was killed Monday by two
pit bulls in Dayton, Ohio, and a
lG-month-old girl was killed in
Oklahoma by one of three pit
bulls owned by her parents.

A Dayton city commissioner
has proposed a ban on pit bulls.

Local prosecutors Wednes-
day said the current law
doesn’t cover dog attacks on
the owner’s property — the cir-
cumstances of Monday’s inci-
dent — so the owners probably

1 won’t be charged.

The Humane Society recom-
mends laws on all dangerous
dogs, not just pit bulls.

Problem with pit bull laws,
said Roger Childress of the
Bremerton, Wash, Humane
Society is “they don’t address
other dogs with problems.”

 

 




Think of the environment
IT’S TIME that wildlife managers dealt in

ecosystems rather,than in game species.-

Emphasis is placed on manipulation of habitat

rather than on protection or restoration of as

natural environment that would provide for a
diversity of wildlife.

Aldo Leopold, the father of wildlife man-
agement, said that wildlife administrators are
too busy producing something to shoot at.

DETROIT FREE PRESS - April 4,1987

 

Do hunters help or hurt wzldlzﬁ?

f the subject were so not so grim, Thomas
L. Washington’s arguments 1n defense of
hunting in the March 29 Free Press would

- almost be amusing "(“Hunting: Beneficial
management or brutal slaughter?”). They
consisted of the same humbug that he and his
Michigan United Conservation Clubs have
'been laying on us for, 10, these many years.

Now, it’s true that the special tax on the
sale of guns and ammunition, the fees for
hunting licenses, and the purchase of duck
stamps generate substantial sums of money
that are apportioned to state wildlife projects.
The catch is that virtually all of this money is
spent propagating so-called game species,
although non-game species account for 90
percent of the country’s 3,700 types of wild-
life.

In 1986, the Michigan Department of
Natural Resources invested nearly $8 million
in projects calculated to multiply game ani-
mals, but a mere $600,000 in projects to help
non-game animals. And practically every bit
of that $600,000 was derived from a taxpay-
ers’ checkoff system on state income tax
refunds.

Theanswer, not the problem

_ THE MARCH 29 anti-hunting article by
Lewis Regenstein was a preposterous aggre-
gation of half-truths and patent falsehoods.
Particularly disturbing was the misrepresen-
tation of the Pittman-Robertson program,
which may very well be the single most
important factor in the conservation and
preservation of wildlife in the United States.

The act Was established in 1937 with the
intent of re-establishing wildlife habitat. It
has been funded by an 11 percent manufac-
turers excise tax on guns, ammunition, ar-
chery equipment, and state hunting license
fees. Since its inception, $2 billion has been
raised for wildlife restoration. Thirteen per-
cent of the fund has gone toward the purchase
of approximately four million acres of land.
Fifty percent of the fund has gone toward
habitat enhancement on those lands. Twenty-
seven percent of the fund goes toward re-
search in game management.

. Has the Pittman- Robertson program
worked? By any measurement the answer is
yes. Many threatened or endangered species
in the early part of this century have been re-
established in astounding numbers. Non-
game species have also benefited from habitat

. enrichment.

As we continue to crowd out wildlife
habitat with development, programs such as

Pittman-Robertson become increasingly

more important. Sportsmen, with judicious

f use of their tax and license dollars, are the
' answer to wildlife preservation, not the
problem. .

Shoot those animals
AFTER READING Thomas L. Washing-

- ton’s pro-hunting article, I’ve finally gotten it

through my thick skull: Hunters kill for
altruistic reasons. That being the case, go to
it, Mr. Washington: Kill, kill, kill.

The thrill of blasting away

I WONDER how many hunters would be
interested in hunting if they couldn’t use
guns. If hunting didn’t offer an opportunity to
use guns on a live target, I suspect the ranks
would thin considerably. Trapping and bow
and arrow can hardly match the macho thrill
of blasting away with a gun while helping to
control animal populations as a steward of
our natural resources.

BERNIE KLEIN

Man-made surpluses

AS A HUNTER, I do not let my fishing and
hunting fees give me license to state unequiv-
ocal domain over the creatures I see. As a
professional fishery biologist currently man-
aging commercial fisheries in the Great
Lakes, I understand the vagaries involved
with managing wildlife populations.

As stated by Thomas L. Washington,
wildlife management is based on tapping into
a harvestable surplus. However, any popula-
tion in equilibrium with the environment has
no harvestable surplus. It is only through
manipulation. by man that a surplus is pro-
duced: This is how biologists and game

3 managers take advantage of the otherwise

natural mortality of wild animals. The higher
the natural mortality, the more surplus that
can be generated. This is why the argument

by Washington that “hunting is humane” 1s
«not str1ctly true because, in fact, species such ‘

as deer are managed at artificially high:
‘ populations, as claimed by Lewis Regenstein, ;

I‘ .

in order to skim more “harvestable surplus’
cream off the crop.
Therefore, the current carrying capacity
' is actually derived by the sportsmen’s dollar

bills pushing at the system. As apparent in;
Washington’s case, pro-hunting discussions

do not progress very far anymore Without
some reference to dollars‘spent some
conservation ethic! ,
The upshot is that sportsmen need to
embrace more of the ethical attributes touted
by people such as Regenstein, especially in
the face of ever-increasing hunting pressure.
Conversely, Regenstein and followers need to
recognize the contribution to wildlife science
and habitat preservationIconservation
sportsmen have provided.

Humane groups will win out

DOVE HUNTING has been derailed be-
cause that’s the way the people want it. Fake
fur coats were substituted for real furs at the
Miss USA Pageant because people are seeing
fur for what it' 13 — unnecessary and barbaric.
Besides, the fakes used were beautiful and
showed you can have class without death.

Humane groups will continue to strive to
stop cruelty, control pet overpopulation, re-
store endangered species and to preserve our
environment. We understand and respect the
cycle of life; it just doe s not include the
senseless abuse and slaughter of animals.

STACY JACKSON

Divide the nation

I HAVE been a lover of wildlife and a
hunter all of my life. I think I have finally
thought of the perfect solution to this argu- .
ment.

I suggest that Lewis Regenstein and all his
supporters take all their people to one half of

the United States and settle there. Then I
suggest that Thomas Washington and all his
supporters settle-in the other half.

Once this is accomplished, Regenstein
could promptly ban all hunting, continue to
do nothing for wildlife, keep on spaying all
those dogs and cats, and still line his pockets
by telling his people how awful those hunters
are. The only drawback about this arrange-
ment is that 15 or 20 years down the road,
when Regenstein’s half doesn’t have any
wildlife left, they will all probably say the
reason for that is because the hunters shot all
of them before they left. .

fences, blinds and buildings for the
convenience of sportsmen.

The Michigan Department of Natu-
ral Resources often brags about how it
has in recent years increased the state’s
deer population from 400,000 to more
than a million. But it seldom mentions
how many acres of forest had to be cut

-_ing and maintaining roads, trails,

and natural areas bulldozed to produce
the necessary deer-browse scrub, or
the cost to farmers whose crops are
damaged by, and to motorists who
have collisions with, the overpopulated

deer. ‘

What must be done to save our
wildlife: The one thing that hunters,
non-hunters and anti-hunters should
agree on is that more government
money should be used to buy endan-
gered habitats and less should be used
to coddle hunters and propagate deer.
Unless we can halt the ever-increasing

destruction of our remaining natural

areas and provide adequate protection
to imperiled species that are being
hunted, such as grizzlies and several
species of ducks, someday there simply
won’t be much left to shoot at or argue
over. State and federalwildlife man-
agement programs, not groups like the
Fund for Animals, represent the real
threat to the future of sport hunting in
America.

 




WITH WINTER behind us, every-
one will agree that it was very mild.
DNR biologists predict that almost 100
percent. of the deer herd will survive,
making this year’s herd one of the
largest in state history. Already there
have been numerous complaints about
deer damage to Christmas trees, fruit
orchards and other cr0ps. The damage
is estimated in the hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars.

On a very alarming note, this in-'

creased deer herd size will also mean
more deer-car accidents and a possible
increase in human fatalities. How
would one curb the problem of this
large deer herd? There are only two
real solutions. One is to hope for a very
severe winter and a large starvation to
reduce the deer herd. The other is to
harvest the surplus population via
hunting. This will create recreational
opportunities and large monetary gains
for the state and local merchants and
ensure that the deer resource is utilized
instead of left unused and wasted in the
woods.

The debate probably will never be
resolved and everyone is entitled to his
or her opinion. Everyone is also entitled
to his or her rights. Hunting has long
been a form of survival, subsistence
and recreation. You will not meet a
truer conservationist than a hunter.
They pay for their recreation, support
its ideals, and fight for the preservation
of the nation’s dwindling natural re-
sources. They do not harm existing
populations and actually help sustain
healthier populations. The hunter
should never be sneezed at. He is an
educated, concerned, and responsible
'steward of our natural resources.

that is essential for the well-being and
conservation of wildlife. Putting aside
the question of what sport there is in
blasting squirrels, bears, raccoon and
other harmless, defenseless wild ani-
mals with high-powered rifles and
shotguns, the facts make it clear that
wildlife management, as. practiced, is
often inconsistent with and severely
harmful to the conservation of wildlife
species and their natural habitats.

The threat to endangered species:
Hunting has been responsible for help-
ing to wipe out numerous species of
US. wildlife, including the heath hen,
Eastern and Merriam elk, passenger
pigeon, Carolina parakeet, ivory-billed
woodpecker, Eskimo curlew and big-
horn. Hunting —— for sport or profit —
has been a major factor in the decline of
many birds andmammals that are
considered endangered or threatened,
such as the grizzly bear, whooping
crane, African leopard, jaguar and
Florida panther (of which perhaps a
dozen or two survive). After two years
of extensive hearings, the US. Senate
Commerce Committee in 1973 issued a
report that said that “the two major
causes of extinction are hunting and
destruction of habitat.” '

The decline of North America’s
waterfowl: And where is the alleged
harvestable surplus of ducks and
geese? On July 23, 1985, the US. Fish
and Wildlife Service warned that “the
total breeding numbers of ducks this
year is the lowest recorded during 31
years of surveys, and includes declines
in all but one of the 10 duck species not
important to waterfowl hunters.” Hav-
ing blamed the alarming decline in part
on hunting, the agency on Aug. 14,
1985, again stated that “total spring
breeding populations of most ducks
important to waterfowl hunters were
19 percent lower than last year and 24
percent below their average for the
past 30 years. “More _ restrictive

are being destroyed

By LEWIS REGENSTEIN

Another hunting season has just come and gone, and the
“sportsmen’s” annual ritual of taking to the woods to kill,
cripple, and maim hundreds of millions of defenseless wild
animals has, at least for the moment, largely ended. Still, the
suffering of millions of animals continues, and the forests
are full of crippled and orphaned I
birds and mammals and those
that have lost their mates.

Because it makes hunters un-
comfortable to justify this
wholesale slaughter on the
grounds of fun and recreation,
the gun lobby likes to pretend
the carnage is undertaken for the
purpose of wildlife management — a principle, we are told,

 

 

 

 

hunting regulations for ducks are need-
ed this year. . . . ” Yet under pressure

from hunting groups, the agency re-
fused to accede to urgings from the
Fund for Animals and other conserva-
tion groups to close or strictly limit the
, duck-bunting season, instead issuing

weak and modest restrictions on hunt-
ing dates and bag limits.

Moreover, the Interior Department ‘
estimates that some 21/2 million ducks
are crippled each year by hunters; the
same number or more waterfowl die
annually of poisoning from buckshot,
; which builds up in marsh bottoms and

is ingested by feeding dUCkS. Hunting
3 groups have been in the forefront of the
I fight to block government-proposed
, restrictions on lead shot, which is to be
i? phased-in for some areas.

_ Managing for an overpopulation of
deer: There is one argument that game
;; managers always resort to: that hunt-
ing is necessary to keep deer herds
., healthy and prevent overpopulation
5 and starvation. But, in fact, deer over-
ﬂ population is often brought about or
3 exacerbated by hunter-run fish and
g game departments propagating and
“managing for” deer in so-called Wild-
life restoration programs, which delib-
, erately try to create a surplus of deer
through restocking programs, clearing
forests, and other manipulations of
habitat.

Indeed, most of the money that
hunters claim to contribute to conser-
7 vation of the “resource” actually goes
to damage habitats and other species of
wildlife in order to propagate more
deer. This was made clear by the
interior Department in its 1978 Draft
Environmental Impact Statement on
federal aid to states for so-called fish
and wildlife restoration under the Pitt-
man-Robertson program. The state-
ment reveals that only about one-.

populations and there is no one who
respects wildlife more. Hunters under-
stand the various aspects of nature and
its effect on an animal’s life history.
Hunters hunt in accordance with the
law because they do understand that
the law is set in accordance with what
trained wildlife biologists feel is the
right balance between hunting and the
animal’s life history. '

The term “carrying capacity”
seems to be understood by all. It means
the number of individuals that a habitat
will support under natural conditions.
, Any number of individuals over the
carrying capacity is considered sur-
plus. Many wildlife species are at this
level in Michigan.

Wildlife biologists recommend to
the state Natural Resources Commis-
sion what the harvest should be for the
various species in their area. What this
means is that a wildlife biologist in
close contact with his area is able to
assess the wildlife populations in his
area and recommend to the commis-
sion what theharvest shOuld be, based
on the size of the surplus.

19505 generated from 1.5 million to
two million hunter days of recreational

and this is just a 21-day season for a

season generated an estimated $257
million in total spending. ' .

gued, are cyclic in nature and thus are

in this category. It has been biological-

nuisance to humans. Muskrat are a
prime example, as are deer. There are
not too many creatures that can be
more devastating to a wetland than a
muskrat. When populations become
too large they can create thousands of

; dollars in damage to man-made struc-
tures. An example is the damage done

to the Shiawassee National Wildlife
Refuge dike system. When muskrat
became too numerous to this area they
started to tunnel into the dikes. The

‘ dikes became weakened and finally

collapsed, causing thousands of dollars
in damage not only to the refuge but
also in repair costs.

lives to free whales

Fishing nets increasingly trap mammals

Lon Angeles Daily News .

‘ZUMA BEACH, Calif. -— Whe
lifeguard Craig Mattox heard a gray
whale was caught in a giant nylon
gill net about 300 yards off shore, he
didn‘t hesitate — he went to the res-
cue. ‘ .

With lifeguards George Merritt,
John Renaud and Jack Campbell,
he headed to sea where the whale
was thrashing, its tail dragging
about 200 feet of net .

“It was hung up in the kelp bed
and was exhausted," Mattox said.

“I jumped in the water and
patted it on the side below its eye,"
he recounted. “There was some
communication there. It knew what
I was doing."

Mattox and the other lifeguards '
who helped free the whale earlier
this month off Zuma Beach are l
among a growing number of South-
ern Californians who have risked
their lives to save whales caught in
commercial fishermen’s gill nets,
hundreds of feet long.

As use of the controversial gill
nets — which can increase a fisher-
man’s catch dramatically —- has ex-
panded, so has the toll on sea mam-
mals. ,

Tom Lewis, president of the Los
Angeles chapter of the American
Cetacean Society, said the number
of gray whales caught in gill nets
increased from four in the winter
of 1984 to 10 in 1985 to 12 in 1986.

This winter, seven migrating
whales are known to have been
caught in gill nets, with the peak
migration season weeks ahead,
Lewis said. The problem areas are
near the shore at Point Dume, Dana
Point and Palos Verdes.

“Most of them are young ani-
mals," Lewis said. “They are prima-
rily getting caught in halibut nets
anchored to the bottom. The net
continues to cinch down tighter
and tighter and can cause serious
wounds.

“Two have come up on the beach
dead this year,” he said. “They can
also be trapped under water and '
drown, and there is no way of know-
ing how many have died under wa-
ter.”

 

Alisa Schuman, whale research
director for the Los Angeles chap-
ter of the society, said 17,000 to
19,000 gray whales migrate up and =
down the coast each winter.
“We’ve been seeing between 15
and 50 a day,” she said. "Most of the
southbound gray whales have al-
ready passed by. The northbound
migration is just beginning. They
tend to travel closer to shore when
they are going north. By the first
week of March —— the peak of the
northbound migration -— we seegan
average of 90 whales a day during
daylight hours." .
Sports fishermen are the main
critics of gill nets in Southern. Calt- .
fornia. They claim the nets lndls-
criminately trap large numbers of
fish, many of which are thrown
away by the commercial fishermen.
ReSponding to their complaints,
California Assemblywoman Cathie
Wright, RSimi Valley, wrote legisla-
tion signed into law last year that
places a moratorium on new gill
' netting permits until 1990.

“My original intent was that
there be no use of gill nets three
miles from the coastline,” Wright
said. “It was because of complaints I
was getting from Ventura and Santa
Barbara that there were so many
nets out there that the Sportsfisher-
men couldn’t even get out there to
fish.”

Lewis said that he and others ac-
tive in the whale rescue effort do
not want to get involved in the con-
troversy.

; “We are neutral on gill nets, and
we want to keep it that way,” Lew15
said. “No fisherman wants to catch
a whale. It destroys their net, which
might cost $10,000 or $15,000.” .

In September 1985, when LEWIS

' realized that increasing numbers of
whales were getting trapped, he
and four friends set up the Whale

Rescue Unit. They have a 49-foot

boat called Westwind and several

Boston whalers supplied by MBC

Applied Environmental Sciences of

Costa Mesa, Calif.

The group has set up the Whale ;
Rescue Hotline — (213) 543-2888— 2
monitored 24 hours a day for re- '
ports of whales trapped in nets off
Los Angeles and Orange counties.

. Lewis said saving a trapped

whale is extremely dangerous.

; “A slight tap of a whale’s tail can

literally break someone in two,"
: Lewis said.

' Bob Talbot, a photographer and a
member of the rescue team, was
nearly killed in January 1985 when
his scuba diving tank and fin got
caught in a gill net he was trying to
cut off a whale.

,“The more the whale thrashed,
the more “1 gm entangled,” Talbot

"1 was dragged dawn under the

' water and back up again,” he said. i

“I couldn’t even tell you how many ‘
times I was pulled up and down. At

tank off my back, and the last time

the whale pulled me down another

diver was able to cut the net loose.”
Rick Ware, a member of the res-

MBC Applied Environmental Sci-
ences, said Talbot’s experience con-
vinced the group it was too danger- ,
ous to wear scuba gear when trying
to free netted whales. They now at-
tempt to cut the nets loose‘ while re-
maining in their boats, using

 

 

 

' knives at the end of long poles.

Aging dolphin lost in river dies
in arms of would-be rescuers

By ROB MECKEL
Post Reporter

 

An aging wayward dolphin
swam several miles up the San J a-
cinto River Friday, but died in the
arms of rescuers rushing to return
it to salt water. '

“It’s one of those situations of
it’s damned if you do and damned

if you don’t do something to help _

the dolphin,” said a saddened
John Kerivan, general curator at
Sea-Arama Marineworld in Cal-
veston.

Kerivan said the 9-foot, 500-
pound Atlantic bottlenosed dolphin
apparently died of shock after be-
ing captured in a small cove two
miles south of the U.S. 90 bridge at
the San Jacinto River.

“We were going right along for
a while, and suddenly it died,”
Kerivan said.

Sea-Arama Director Harry
Brown said the dolphin would be
taken to Texas A&M University’s
marine biology laboratory in Gal—
veston for an autopsy.

Brown’s five-man team went to
the rescue as part of the Texas

Marine Mammal Stranding Net-
work, which cares for marine
mammals that beach themselves
or become stranded. '

Brown said the team had no al-
ternative but to capture the dol-
phin and return it to salt water. It
would have died within a couple of
days in the fresh water of the San
J acinto River, he said.

The dolphin was captured about
7 p.m. after the Sea-Arama team,
assisted by Chris Klumpp of the
U.S. Coast Guard and two ﬁsher-
men who first spotted the dolphin,
corralled it with a 300-foot fishing
net.

Before being captured, the dol-
phin was coralled twice but both
times managed to slip under the
net and swim to a larger part of
the cove.

Rescuers spent several hours
earlier trying unsuccessfully to
maneuver the dolphin through a
15-foot-wide channel out of the
cove, down the river and back to
sea, said Ken Ramirez, Sea-Ara-
ma’s director of dolphin training.

Ramirez said dolphins rarely
swim so far into fresh water. One

was spotted in the Turning Basin a
couple of years ago, and some
have been seen swimming in the

Houston Ship Channel, he said.

He said Friday’s traveler may
have gotten confused or may have
followed a school of fish into the

- cave and become afraid to go back

through, Ramirez said.

“Or it may have been trying to
escape something,” he said. He
described the animal as old ' -
ing some teeth and blind ne
eye. '

Kerivan said the dolphin’s body
had “humongus shark wounds
that had healed over.” He said the
dolphin also appeared to have
been suffering from a virus.

Ramirez said the dolphin was
first spotted Thursday afternoon
by Robert Hayes and Mike Car-
penter as they were setting fishing
lines in the cove.

“We watched it a couple of
hours and tried to chase him back
into the river but he’d swim by the
mouth (of the cove) and never go
out it,” Carpenter said.

Hayes said he and Carpenter
notified Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department officials.

’ Hungry Eagles Find Danger _:

At Navy BaSe in Alaska

Adak, Alaska .

Eagles scrounging food
scraps at the Adak Naval Sta-
tion are being electrocuted
while perching on power poles
to watch for free handouts,
wildlife officials said.

“In the past, we’ve had as high
as 50 eagles die from electrocution
each winter, but the Navy’s done a
lot to reduce that,” said Fred Zeille-
maker, Adak manager for the Alas-
ka Maritime National Wildlife Ref-
uge. . '

About 20 bald eagles still die
each winter on Adak, far out in the
Aleutian Islands chain, and Zeille-
maker has issued an appeal to
Adak’s 5,000 Navy personnel and de»
pendents: Don’t feed the eagles.

Eagles are native to the treeless
Aleutian Islands, nesting in cliffs
and rocks.”

When the Pentagon introdticed
telephone poles to the treeless land-
scape -- an inviting perch —— and

brought in thousands of people,
there was a new threat to the giant
. birds. ,

. When an eagle, attracted to _'
Adak by food scraps, spreads its ’

wings —— as much 71/2 feet from tip
to tip —-- and touches two wires, “it
cooks them very well with the high
power," Zeillemaker said.

To prevent America’s national
symbol from electrocution at the
base, Zeillemaker said those station-
ed on Adak are being urged not to
leave food scraps out -— purposeful-
ly or carelessly.

Saving Sea Turtles
The New York Times

Busloads of angry Louisiana
shrimpers went to Washington last
week to continue their battle with
environmentalists over turtles. Every
year more than 10,000 sea turtles be-
come entangled and die in the nets of
shrimp fishermen. Without protec-
tion, four of the five species native to
U.S. waters could dwindle to extinc-
tion, environmentalists fear.

The conflict between industry and
environment is classic, but this time
there’s a practical remedy: turtle ex-
cluder devices on the top of shrimp
nets that serve as escape hatches.
Because of their scarcity, all five
species of turtles in U.S. waters are
protected by the Endangered Species
Act. The National Marine Fisheries
Service helped develop several of
the excluder devices and hoped
shrimp fishermen would use them
voluntarily. But that has not hap-
pened. So the head of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
tration, Dr. Anthony Calio, asked
government, conservation groups
and the fishing industry to negotiate.
Their agreement requires most
shrimp boats to use excluder devices,
depending on where, when and at
what depth they trawl.

Yet some shrimp fishermen re-
main fiercely oppcsed. The most vo-
cal are Louisiana shrimpers, whose
representative failed to sign the
agreement. They say Louisiana’s in-
shore waters are too cluttered with
ﬂotsam for the devices to function
properly. Extensive tests show that if
properly used, excluders let turtles
escape and don’t reduce shrimp
hauls. They also rid nets of non-tar-
get game fish, which otherwise are
dumped over the side.

Calio has demonstrated admirable
skill in balancing legitimate fishing
industry concerns with the duty to ‘
protect sea turtles. Let him now take

. the final step and turn the informal

agreement into a fair set of regula- .
: tions, and give one of our more frag- 1'

lie sea creatures a fighting chance to

survive.

LONDON OBSERVER - March 29, 1987

-.

A new danger to swimmers and ﬁsh may be lurking in our rivers.

TE

Although Britain’s freshwater fish are
enjoying a temporary respite from the
hook (angling’s close season started on
15 March), they now face a more
frightening menace — the common
snapping terrapin. in recent years this
North American reptile, which can grow
up to two feet long and weigh up to two
stone, has become a popular domestic
pet. Last year more than 1,200 common
snappers were imported into the UK. ’
The Thames Water Authority is worried
that some of these will end up in our
rivers and lakes, gobbling up the fish
stocks. Already a colony of red-eared
terrapins, presumably released by their
owners, has been spotted in the Thames
near Oxford. And last month, another
specimen, the size of a dinner plate, was
retrieved from a pond on Wandsworth
Common, south London. Fortunately, red-
eared terrapins are harmless, but the
TWA is convinced that it is only a matter
of time before their carnivorous cousins,
the snappers, go on the rampage.
‘People buy these terrapins when they
are hatchlings and about the size of a 50p
piece,’ says Brigitte Daniels of the TWA.
'They don’t realise just how big they can
become. Once the snappers outgrow
their tanks, the chances are that their

owners will release them into the wild.

‘We are trying to prevent a problem
before it occurs. The snappers are
dangerous predators, and if they started
to live in our rivers and lakes they would
upset the ecological balance.’

Reptile enthusiasts, however, are
anxious to quell any anti-snapper hysteria
before it gets out of hand. Steve Zlotowitz
of the British Pet Trade and Industry
Association says that bathers have
nothing to fear. ‘lt's possible that the odd
snapper might survive in the wild, but
they won't become a major problem.
Although our winters are similar to those
in America, our summers aren’t warm
enough for them to breed. in this climate,
they wouldn’t be able to incubate their
eggs.‘

While reptile experts may vouch for the
harmlessness of the snappers, their
grotesque appearance suggests that they
are not the kind of creature with whom
anyone would wish to share a bath. Their
shells give them an ugly, neolithic look,
and they have articulated heads which
pop out at mealtimes. Their mouths
(usually coated with green'slime) taper
into a mean-looking 'beak’fprobably
strong enough to remove a‘finger.

However, even if the snappers are at

cmnmc an mum in unvmriw (ma GIAVO A9 HdVUDC

large it is unlikely that they will be spotted
before the-summer. In winter and spring
they spend much of their time hibernating
on the river beds. They can go without
food for months.

Steve Zlotowitz remains unconvmcec‘,
though, that the snappers will cause any
harm. ‘Only a very small number of
snappers would ever be released,‘ he
says, ‘50 fish stocks won’t be at risk. A lor
of snappers were imported last year. but
most of those were destined for the sour.-
trade.

‘Most people who buy these pets are
responsible. You need a licence to keep
them and it is illegal to release them.
There is little chance of anyone.

THE HOUSTON POST - April 2, 1987

Buying the Whales

rnight ‘ save them i

’Ownership' of herd would promote

“To hunt a species to extinction is not logical. ”

— First Ofﬁcer Spock, Star Trek IV

By JOHN MAJ EWSKI

 

In the 23rd century, an alien probe is inadvertently
destroying the Earth with the superamplified sounds
of humpback whales. Since whales became extinct in
the 20th century, the crew of the starship Enterprise
must travel to 1986 to bring back two whales, which
will answer the probe and save Earth.

Filled with images of man’s brutal slaughter of
defenseless creatures, Star Trek IV exposes the plight
of the world’s whale population to millions of Ameri-
cans. Though we may not have to worry about alien
probes for a while, the movie presents an impassioned
plea to save the whales. But the only hint of a solution

to the decreasing whale populations is for us somehow ,

to become better people.

In this regard, the movie’s characters echo the cry
of contemporary environmentalists. The problem of
whale conservation is seen in the black-and-white
terms of “good guys” versus “bad guys.” If we can
only make the greedy, self-centered Whalers see the
light of the environmentalism, the whales would be
saved.

Unfortunately, the morality-play approach has
failed to stop the whalers in Japan and the Soviet
Union. Even in relatively enlightened America, the
moralizing of the environmentalists often has led
more to cynical “Nuke the Whale” bumper stickers
than sincere interest in the plight of the whales.

Mr. Spock focuses on the key issue: “To hunt a
species to extinction is not logical.” The movie whale
biologist’s quick reply is: “Who said the human race
was logical?”

Economists argue that human beings are logical,
given 'the incentives they face. It is the system of
property rights (or lack thereof), along with other
institutions, that makes up the incentives that in turn
produce a particular pattern of behavior. Examining

the property rights framework of whaling sheds light __

on the mystery of the vanishing whales.

This method of analysis leads economists to con-j
clude that ”greedy” Whalers are not the root of: the;

problem. Ranchers and farmers are -‘

as Whalers, yet cattle and Cornish 33231232222832?

other marine animals, boosting the populations of
each species.

The problem of whales is their property-rights ;
framework. They are a classic case of what environ- 5.
mentalist Garrett Hardin calls the “tragedy of the ‘
commons.” Since no one owns the whales, people"
have an interest in exploiting them before others do.

Imagine a group of children sipping one milkshake
through different straws. According to Hardin’s argu-
ment, each child will sip as fast as possible because if
one stops to conserve the shake, other children will
get more of it, leaving the young conservationist high
and dry. This is the essence of the whale tragedy. In
the absence of property rights, Whalers have the in-
centive to kill whales as fast as they can. " ‘ .

Though it is logical to establish property rights in,
whales, it doesn’t take a Vulcan like Spock to see the i,
roadblocks to such a plan. While the problems are-i
real, modern technology can make a solution feasible. 1

Enforcement would be expensive. Unlike cattle and f
Cornish hens, whales in the ocean cannot bephysical- {7
1y restricted to a certain area. A whale owner would;
have to monitor his animal for its entire life. Up to'
now that has not been practical. . i

Enter modern transmitting devices. Powerfuli
enough to be detected over long distances, the devices 3
can simplify enforcement. For example, killing a "
whale that is not on your frequency would be illegal.

i

Since many whales stay in herds (called pods), ‘ en-g.

forcement would be even easier; a person could buy;
one pod and use transmitters to monitor its position:
In this manner, he could claim property rights to the
natural increase of the pack, giving him anjincentive
to see to it that the pack grows. > ~ -
The beauty of whale rights is that Whalers w0uld
become conservationists. They would have every in-.
centive to expand their crops. A further advantage is.
that environmental organizations could put their;be-4
liefs into action. Instead of denouncing the fate of
whales, environmentalists could monitor whale packs

WOULD LIKE to commend
Warren J. Iliff on the excellent

proud that such a humane and in-

Iliff stated that “chimps and go-

He is not

' alone in this belief.

. The conclusion of scientists try-
ing to decipher our evolutionary
relationship to the great apes is
that, “Not one but four species of

day — the gorilla (homo gorilla);
the;two chimpanzees, (homo trog-

mates are then forced to endure a
hellish existence in research facili-
ties. Those that are fortunate
enough not to be physically tor-
tured often go mad from isolation
and close conﬁnement. They are
never able to walk or to touch an-
other living being, and many re-
sort to such abnormal behavior as
head banging and self-mutilation.
Many people are not aware of
the extent of animal abuse, while
many others are simply too
steeped in human prejudice to
care. There are important differ-
ences between humans and other

animals, and these differences
must give rise to some differences
in the rights that each have. Rec-
ognizing this simple fact, however,
is no barrier to the obvious case
for extending the basic principle of
rights to non-human animals.

Real or imagined differences in
intellect alone cannot justify
wholesale torture.

Charles Darwin in his book,
“The Expression of the Emotions
in Man and Animals,” notes count-
less non-linguistic modes of ex-
pression. \

The statement, “I am in pain,”
may be one piece of evidence for
the conclusion that the speaker is
in pain, but it is not the only. possi—
ble evidence — and since people
tell lies, not even the best possible
evidence. Human infants are un-
able to use language. Are we to
deny that a 1-year-old child can
suffer? If a being suffers, there can
be no possible justiﬁcation for re-
fusing to take that suffering into
consideration.

Jeremy Bentham wrote: “It may
one day come to be recognized

that the number of the legs, the
villosity of the skin, or the termi-
nation of the os sacrum are rea-
sons equally insufﬁcient for aban-

. doning a sensitive being. What else

is it that should trace the insupera-
ble line? Is it the faculty of reason
or discourse? But a full-grown
horse or dog is beyond comparison
a more rational, as well as a more
conversable animal, than an in—
fant. But suppose they were other-

_ wise, what would it avail? The

question is not, can they reason?
nor can they talk? but, can they
suffer?”

chain. If an owner insists on chain-
ing his dog, the society suggests a
15-foot chain to provide proper
space and recommends that the dog
should be taken off it each day for

exercise. . , y .
_ 7 The soc1ety advrses . against

chains because their use results in

dogs' hyperactivity, fear biting and

parasitism because the dog is con:
tinuously exposed to feces. In sum-

mer, dogs suffer from fly bites be-

cause the unsanitary conditions at-

tract ﬂies. Chains also .keep dogs

from human companionship that

they naturally desire and need.

“Chains lead to a bleak, lonely exJ
istence," Goldenberg said.

Goldenberg has worked in the'

humane law enforcement business
since 1972 and said she knows the
profile of people who neglect ani-
mals. Many of them do not new
animals as companions but as pos-
sessions for a particular use, such
as guard dogs, she said. ' ~

The animal is separated from the
family circle, so the owner never
learns the “endearing qualities or
the positive aspects of the animal,
and . . . they're oblivious or insen-
sitive to the animal’s need of human
companionship or exercise. These
conditions exist in virtually all valid
cases of animal cruelty,” Goldene
berg said. -

In spite of the neglect and abuse
they receive, dogs are grateful for
the attention showed to them, the
humane society ofﬁcial said.

“We've seen dogs so weak' they
could barely stand,” Goldenberg

‘ said, “but they still wagged their
tails when they heard their owners’
voices. It’s the nature of the animal.

. It’s this nature that makes dogs.
such wonderful companions. But it’s
pitiful to see how much they suffer
at the hands of uncaring owners.”

 

Dogs put in
suspended
animation

WASHINGTON (UPI) — Re—
searchers reported Tuesday they
succeeded in producing a sort of
suspended animation in dogs by
cooling them to near-freezing
and removing their blood, a pro-
cess that will aid surgery in hu-
mans.

The dogs survived the proce-
dure without injury, said Paul
Segall, a research associate in
the department of physiology
and anatomy at the University of
California-Berkeley.

“This has got a lot of medical
potential in many different ar-
eas,” said Segall, who will pre-
sent his paper Thursday at the
annual meeting of the Federation
of American Societies for Experi-
mental Biology.

Scientists around the world
have been experimenting with
cooling the body to stall circula-

' tion, heartbeat and other aspects

of metabolism, a process that
could make long operations easi-
er on the patient.
At low temperatures, blood cells
tend to start clumping and may
block arteries. Segall’s team
drained blood from anesthetized
dogs using a heart-lung machine
and replaced it with a blood sub-
stitute of water with chemicals.
After they had been in a near-
frozen state 15 minutes, gradual-
ly increasing proportions of their
own warmed blood were pumped
into the dogs to revive them.

WASHINGTON POST - March 26, 1987

: Watchdog for Animals

Washington Humane Society Always on Alert for Cruelty Cases,
And Though Many Dogs Die, Sometimes There’s a Happy Ending .

 

By Carolyn Hughes Crowley

Special to The Washington Post

 

Two-year-old Duke, an emaci-
ated Doberman pinscher, could
barely walk when it was left shiv-
ering and uncovered on a frigid Jan-
uary night on its former owner’s

. front lawn. .

Ernest Richardson, who had giv-
en Duke to a friend for protection
three months earlier, said he cried
when he saw the dog the next
morning. “I didn’t believe this could
happen to a dog. I called the Wash-
ington Humane Society,” he said.

Brenda Purvis, a humane officer

‘ at the Washington Humane Society
for six years, said Duke’s case was
“the worst I’ve seen when the dog
was still alive.” She said Duke,
starving and dehydrated, couldn’t
stand up for a week.

Purvis said starvation is the
worst cruelty seen by the humane
society, because the animal suffers

a long time. “It’s werse than beat- , ’

‘ ing,” she said.

 

. For 117 years, the Washington
’Humane Society has enforced an-
ticruelty laws in the District. It re-
sponds yearly to 1,200 to 1,500
cases of serious complaints of an-
imal neglect and abuse. Its six hu-
mane officers, trained in criminal
law procedures and animal disease
recognition, answer calls about cru-
elty cases 24 hours every day.

The society resolves most cases
through owners complying with
proper care requirements or the
owner surrendering the animal to
the Washington Humane Society,
which will euthanize or treat it, neu-
ter it and put it up for adoption.
Some cases are resolved in the
courts.

“We’re the animals’ advocate in
Washington,” said Jean Goldenberg,
executive director of the humane
society. “I wish I could say that se-
rious cases of animal cruelty are
rare. But every week we see dogs
that have been mistreated or ne-
glected almost to the point of death.

“We deal with callous and hostile

dw‘

S
A

 

people who believe it’s their right
to treat an animal in any way they
want,” Goldenberg said. “They
steadfastly refuse to provide proper
shelter and argue their dogs are in
good condition when they are in
visibly poor condition, or they deny
physical abuse in the face of eyewit-
ness accounts of a brutal beating. In
those cases, humane education is
often unsuccessful and we educate
them through the strong arm of the
aw.”

Three people have been arrested
under anticruelty laws this year. Of
11 cases last year, two resulted in
jail terms and fines. In one case, a
man received a 90-day jail sen-
tence. In the other case, which in-
volved Duke, now thriving and

healthy with a new owner, a 304 "
year-old woman was sentenced to
90 days with all but seven days sus-
pended for failing to provide Duke '
with sufficient food and water. The ‘
woman also was ordered to pay?
$200 within a year and $20 in court

costs and was told by the judge that
she would violate her three-year
probation if she owns an animal.
Under District law, animal own-
ers must provide adequate shelter,

. food and water. Any person found

violating the District's anticruelty
statutes may be arrested, held with-
out a warrant and prosecuted by the

' .U.S. attorney's office.

Steve Walker, left, and Dixie Eng have adopted Kaiser, a Doberman pinscher, from the humane society. Kaiser’s .
veterinarian, Ann Stohlman, third from left, and Jean Goldenberg of the humane society are on hand for a happy ending.

lIIorI Io Gullaw
Gillneﬂers
.Ijliis a Snug

fter seeing how gillnets have cut a swath of envi-

ronmental destruction and death along the Cali-
fornia coastline, one would think that a citizen-based
initiative campaign to put the gillnetters permanently
out of business would have broad public support, espe-
cially among sports and environmental groups.

. During the last five years the nets, indiscriminate
intheir quarry, have entangled and killed thousands of
shorebirds as well as many marine mammals such as
sea lions, porpoises and whales. They have also virtually
wiped out the inshore Sportfishing for rock cod and hal-
ibut and, many believe, diminished the salmon and
striped bass fisheries as well.

:‘ However, the first large-scale effort to put the issue
of outlawing the nets before voters has itself become
snagged in controversy.

A Southern California organization called the Com-
mittee to Ban Gill Nets is trying to collect 590,000 signa-
tures for a ballot measure in the 1988 state elections.
But it is having little success in Northern California be
cause of an inability to get support here from major
c‘Onservation and sportsmen’ 5 groups. Most of them are

 

 

 

' Gillnetter fishing boat crewman sets nets

endorsing a less restrictive measure authored by state
Senator Milton Marks, D-San Francisco, and introduced
in the Legislature last December.

United Anglers of California, the 15,000-member
club that could be a powerful ally because of its historic
opposition to the nets, has declined to endorse the citi-
zen petition drive.

Why? For one thing, the constitutional amend-
ment proposed by the committee is a slapdash piece of
work; it would prohibit all gill or trammel net use “in -
ocean waters 75 nautical miles” from the California
coast. The problem 18 that state jurisdiction extends for

only three nautical miles, therefore, such a prohibition
legally could not be enforced. .

, The initiative also would make it a felony to sell or
possess any gillnetcaught fish within that zone. Ana-
lysts say this might violate the laws of interstate com-
merce by making a commercial fisherman from Ore-
gon, for example, subject to arrest if he tried to bring
gillnet fish to market 1n California. The measure also
would end gillnet fishing for herring in San Francisco
Bay -— a business that is clearly an innocent bystander.

The Southern Californians who are sponsoring the
gillnet ban seem well-intentioned, if misdirected. They
are reacting not only to a decline in the white sea bass,

barracuda and halibut sport fisheries there, but also to
the dramatic death rate of migrating gray whales that
get trapped and drown in the nets within full view of
beachgoers.

he Los Angeles chapter of the American Cetacean

Society says the number of whales caught in the
nets increased from four in the winter of 1984 to 12 in
’86. Earlier this month, two whales — one a 25foot
young adult and the other a 1510M juvenile —- were
found smothered to death in nets off the fashionable
Palos VerdesRedondo Beach area. Such grisly discov-
eries are bound to get people stirred up, and rightly so.

With that drama playing regularly off the coast of
Los Angeles, Ken Kukuda of Santa Ana, publisher of
South Coast Sportfishing magazine, launched his peti-
tion effort a year ago. “The California Department of
Fish and Game is simply not doing its job. It has allowed
our marine resources to be plundered,” he says.

His group so far has gathered 225,000 signatures,
and has to collect at least 375,000 more by April 13 -— a
formidable task at best. While Kukuda has the support
'. of several Southern California sport fishing and diving

interests, he 15 bitter about his cool reception in the

north “It’s the loophole mentality,” he said. “This is not
a perfect initiative, but someone has to start some;
where. We are trying to send a message to Sacramento.
It’s just unfortunate that other groups have chosen not
to be part of that effort”

wnited Anglers, along with some highly credible or-
ganizations such as the Point Reyes Bird Observato-
ry, the Whale Center, two chapters of the Audubon So-
ciety, the Sierra Club Bay Chapter and others, base en-
dorsed the Marks bill, SB 40, which is now before the 1
Senate Appropriations Committee.

. That measure would extend on a year-round basis
an emergency closure that Fish and Game has ordered,
effective April 1, for the Central California coastline, os-
tensibly to protect harbor porpoises and diving birds
such as common murres. (The DFG will hold a public
hearing on its actions Wednesday at 1: 30 p m. in the

. Menlo Park city Parks and Recreation Building, 700 Al

ma St., Room 112.) . .

Under the emergency ban, ocean waters will close
for 120 days from the Sonoma-Mendocino County line
south to Franklin Point in San Mateo County. 7_ >-

Closures affect waters up to 120 feet deep but ex-
tend to 240 feet deep off Marin County between Point
Reyes and Duxbury Point. Also cloSed up to 240 feet
deep are waters within three nautical miles of the Far-
allon Islands and Noonday Rock (San Francisco) and
five miles of San Pedro (San Mateo County).

John Beuttler, executive director of United An-
glers, is guardedly optimistic about the closures. “We
don’t know if they will do the job. If they don’t, the re-
strictions will have to be extended, and we will hold the

‘ government agencies responsible for doing so. This is

just a start.” __ .

ELAINE
SMITH

A Kennel Ration
OfGood Cheer

 

t’s very noisy in Elaine

Smith’s house—but yours

would be, too, if you shared

quarters with a menagerie of
birds, cats, and dogs. “You don’t
notice it after a while,” she
shouts over a cacophony of
squawks and barks.

. As a child, Smith, 57, lived
with dozens of assorted animals
her grandmother raised in the
lOO-year-old house in Hillside
that Smith still occupies. No
wonder her current housemates
hardly seem like pets. The cast
includes 60-year-old Bennie, a
blue-and-gold macaw who sleeps
in a garbage can upstairs; and
Timmy, a gabby African gray
parrot that says hello in eight lan-
guages. There’s also a chocolate-
colored Labrador called Hershey
and a hyperactive Pomeranian
pup with an appetite for coat
sleeves.

The parrots are the loudest,
but it’s the dogs that make head-
lines. Smith is the co-founder of
Therapy Dogs International, an
organization that brings canine
visitors—and their boundless
affection—to nursing home
patients.

“Many people in nursing
homes don’t get any visitors and

 

they’re very lonely,” she says.
“An animal is nonthreatening
where a human may have bur.
them before. Dogs are silent
partners.”

Several times a month,
Smith—by profession a regis-
tered nurse at the Daughters of
Israel Pleasant Valley Home in
West Orange—shuttles her furry
brood to three New Jersey nurs-
ing homes. While the dogs aren’t
miracle workers, Smith has seen
arthritis victims suddenly able
to pet their new pals and one
woman who hadn’t spoken in
ten years call out to a dog.

Smith first learned about the
calming effect pets can have on
patients while working in a Brit-
ish nursing home ﬁfteen years
ago. It wasn’t until eight years
later, after returning to the US,
that she conjured up Therapy
Dogs International with Milton
Winn of Greenbrook, a former
dog trainer. The group has grown
to include 1,300 members in
America, Australia, New Zea-
land, and Canada.

In New Jersey, some 100 TDI
members make about 300 ﬁeld
visits a year. They maintain the
dogs with their own money, and
charge nothing for the service.
Dues and occasional donations
help pay TDI’s liability insur-
ance. Not that the dogs are
rough, but some of them are
large—between 65 and 80
pounds each. Oddly enough. few
patients are intimidated. Says
Smith: “I never had a patient
who was really frightened.”

caught in debate

Irvmg pair want exception to ordinance

By Julie Wright
Mid-Cities Bureau of The News

IRVING — If Jennifer and Tony
Davis are forced to part with their
2-year-old baby, they say it will be
like losing their own ﬂesh and
blood. .

Never mind that their baby is a
110-pound,4-foot cougar.

The Davises are battling the
city of Irving over whether they
will be able to keep Simza, the
cougar they have raised since it
was 3 weeks old.

The Irving Health Department
says the couple are violating the
City’s ordinance on wild animals.
The Davises say the city should 3
consider the special enclosure ;
they’ve built for Simza in deciding '
whether to grant an exemption to
the ordinance.

“She’s like our baby,” said Mrs.
Davis. “She still sucks his thumb
because we bottle-fed her for so -
long."

The Davises got Simza from a
breeder in Iowa and had her de-
clawed.

But Irving officials say no mat-
ter how tame the animal appears,
it still violates the ordinance
prohibiting wild animals and
must be removed from the city.

Animal control officials have
issued two citations to the Davises
since they were ordered last week
to remove Simza. The citations
carry a maximum fine of $200 per
day.

“If we let this guy do it, we
might as well throw the ordinance
out the window,” said animal con-

trol supervisor Gary Reynolds.
Davis, on the advice of his attor-

ney, removed Simza from his house

Wednesday night to avoid further

citations until the dispute can be '

settled. A City Council member has
asked that the item be put on the
council's April 1 agenda. _

Reynolds said he is concerned
about the safety of neighbors. An el-
ementary school is six blocks from
the Davis residence on East Union
Bower Road.

“When I was over." there," Rey-
nolds said, “I saw two elderly people
taking their morning walk and I
thought, “What if it got out and
scared them?’ "

But Davis said there is little
chance of Simza getting out.

He has built a 12- by 15-foot room
for Simza onto his house. The room,
which Davis estimates cost him
$6,000 to $10,000, is reinforced with
Plexiglas. It has no direct entrance
into the house, but has a door lead-
ing into the garage. A Plexiglas cat
door leads to an outdoor enclosed
chain-link run that has a second
. chain-link fence surrounding it.

‘ ,. Neighbors on both sides of the

Davises have small children and
both have supported his effort to

keep the cougar. .
"lf l didn‘t know the situation,

know how she lives, know her tem-
perament and know how they take
care of her, l might feel differ-
ently,” said JoAnn Baker, who lives
next door. "But it’s a special situa-
tion and I think the city should con-
sider that."

Mrs. Baker said she is more con-
cerned abom her‘ children, ages 6
and 4, playing in the front yard
close to speeding cars than she is
about her neighbors’ pet.

“I’m protective of my kids, but
I‘m not concerned about her,” she
said. “We‘ve gotten used to her, and

it would kind of be disheartening if -9

she had to move elsewhere.”

Some other neighbors had pre— N‘

sented Davis with 12 signatures of
residents opposed to Simza. But
some of those have changed their
minds since seeing the enclosure. _ .
“The guy who brought it (the pe-
tition) around exaggerated the
whole thing —— he made it sound as
if there was a cougar just roaming
loose in the neighborhood," said
' Kasey West, one of theNsigners. “Af-

Neighborhood reaction will
probably be a determining factor
for City Council members, who
have indicated they may consider
an exemption to the ordinance.

Council member Leonard Bur-
ton said he would favor a permit
system that, if certain requirements
were met, would allow the Davises
to keep Simza. -,

“I don't see this animal as any
more dangerous than a Doberman
or a pit bull,” Burton said.

Council member Lars Ehne
buske said he would want to see
opinions from experts in handling
wild animals confirming the safety
of Simza‘s enclosure.

The Davises are counting on
council support to be able to keep
what has become a member of their
family. ‘ '

"I haven’t even considered tak-
ing her anywhere,” Davis said. "If
someone were to ask you to take
your kid to California, even if it
were a good home, I don't think you
could do it.”

Investigator says dog pound

A

in Clayton complies with law

 

By Lee Dancy
Staff Writer

 

'An investigator for the state
Department of Agriculture who in-
spected the Clayton County dog
pound Wednesday found it was
complying with the state’s new An-
imal Protection Act.

“There was no evidence of rat
infestation,” said Department of
Agriculture press secretary Chris-
tine Thompson.

“The cages were clean, the an-
imals were well fed and watered,
and the facility was basically in
compliance with the Animal Pro-
tection Act.”

Dixon Blackwood, investigator
for the Department of Agriculture
General Field Forces, toured the
pound after the Clayton County
HumaneSociety filed a formal
complaint earlier this month.

Society board member and
Jonesboro lawyer Jay Bouldin stat-
ed in the complaint that the
pound’s attic was infested with
rats and that animals killed in the
pound’s carbon monoxide chamber
sometimes remained there from
1% hours to half a day before

; enough of the gas was pumped in

3 to kill the animals.

Bouldin’s complaint said a dog,

believed to have been killed in the

\

chamber, was taken to the county
landfill and buried, but revived

and dug itself out.

“I’m sure the official at the
pound is qualified at what he is
doing,” Ed Bridges, treasurer for

.the Humane Society, said after

Thursday’s inspection.

“If he said they’re in compli-
ance, then we’ll just have to ac—
ceptit.”

But Bridges insisted he has
heard rustling noises above his
head many times while at the
pound, and found rat droppings re-
cently while cleaning up the Hu-
mane Society office there.

Blackwood told Rabies Control
Department Director Robert Folds
he would return today to watch
animals being killed in the carbon

'monoxide chambers because they

have been at the pound more than
a week.

“The Department of Agricul-

ture man said there should be a
window on the chamber,” Folds
said, adding that operators of the
chamber could then know when all
animals in the concrete-block unit
are dead.

An 11-horsepower, air-cooled
motor pumps the deadly gas into
one of two chambers, both of
which are about 4 feet high.

A mange-infested dog captured
Wednesday was killed in less'than
seven minutes in the pound’s
smaller 3-by-3—foot chamber. "

Folds said the procedure takes
about 15 minutes in the larger
chamber, which is about 6 feet by
8 feet.

Bouldin objected to the Depart-
ment of Agriculture releasing a
statement about the pound before
Blackwood saw the chamber being
used to kill animals. '

“That’s like buying a car with-
out cranking it,” he said. “How do
you know there’s an engine in
there? I think they said too much
too quickly.”

Clayton County Operates its
Rabies Control Department on an
annual budget of $161,939 for 1987.

The county pound took in 6,941
animals during 1986 and destroyed
3,200 of them because they were
not adopted within a week after
they were picked up.

Animals Skinned and Dumped in Lakewood Were Coyotes;

' By LEE HARRIS, Times Staff Writer

The deftly skinned animal carcasses that
have been turning up in Lakewood are the
remains of coyotes—not dogs—that appar-
ently were caught in steel traps and killed for
their pelts, SPCA officers said Thursday.

. An autopsy performed on the last of the
four carcasses that have been discovered
‘ since December showed that the anim yhad
fed on small‘animals and possibly a“"ird_,
according to Cpl. Vicki Young of the Los’.‘
Angeles Society for the Prevention of Cruel-

, ty to Animals. ' . '

“This is typical coyote food,” Young said. .

Even though it is not against the law to

trap and kill coyotes, the SPCA investigation _

r

of the animal killings will continue because
dumping carcasses within 150 yards of an
occupied dwelling is a misdemeanor.

Since it appears that the animals were
killed for their pelts, SPCA officers are
speculating that the animals were trapped in
the Sierra and brought to Los Angeles, SPCA
Lt. Charles Reed said. Coyotes in the Sierra
would grow longer, thicker and more valua-
ble pelts, Reed said. '

“Urban coyotes’ pelts are pretty scruffy
and brown and are unwelcome in the fur
industry," said Larry Sitton, associate biolo-
gist with the state Department of Fish and
Game.

A good quality pelt could be purchased at
auctions or wholesale for $50 to $150 and

could become part of a coat that would sell

for between $4,000 and $6,000, according to
Jeffrey Lehman, a vice president of Somper
Furs in Beverly Hills. However, Lehman
said, it is unlikely that a furrier would
purchase one or two pelts from an individual.

Found in Alley

The first skinned carcass was found in an
alley behind Ralphs Grocery Market, 5951 E.
Del Amo Blvd., in early December. A few
weeks later two more were found behind a
Carl’s Jr. fast-food outlet at 5535 Del Amo

Blvd. On April 8, the last one 'was found
behind Carl’s. The remains were stuffed in
plastic trash bags and left beside dumpsters.
Public outrage that arose when it was
believed that someone was killing dogs led to
the creation of a reward fund that has taken
in $8,000 in contributions, in addition to
$1,000 provided by the SPCA. On Thursday,
the SPCA called donors to tell them of the
latest developments and to ask that the fund
be maintained. .
“All agreed. It doesn’t matter that it’s a
coyote. It is cruelty. It is atrocious. The
reward is still being offered," said Renee
Sheranian, SPCA director of development.

Wild life
Family tours country
with rescued animals

By KAREN McCOWAN
The Arizona Republlm

So you think your life’s a zoo?

Step into Dennis and Penney Williams’ shoes for a
week. The Australian couple and their two children hit
festivals and fair circuits in the United States and
Canada with the 80 wild animals that make up their
African Safari traveling zoo.

The family will call Tempe Diablo Stadium, 2200 W.
Alameda Drive, home this weekend as they participate
in the Great Arizona Get-Together, a carnival to raise
funds for multiple-sclerosis research. The carnival,
; which began Friday night, continues today from noon
to midnight and Sunday from noon to 8 pm.

_ The couple began an "animal rescue” effort a decade
' ago when they were working as journalists researching
Africa’s Pygmy tribe. They were accompanying a group
of tribal hunters who killed a guenon monkey, part of
the Pygmy diet. Clinging to the breast of the dead

female monkey was a tiny baby. The Williamses asked '
if they could~try to save the infant. It became the ﬁrst '

member of their zoo. .

”We keep only those animals
that have been orphaned, injured
or domesticated to the point that
they could not survive if released in
their natural habitat,” Dennis W11-
liams said. “We take a lot of
animals about to be put to sleep
because people don’t know what to
do with them.” .

He added that a key pomt they
try to make with their zoo is that
wild animals are not appropriate

pets. . , .
“People will buy a httle’ hon or
bear cub as a novelty,” he ex-~
plained. "Then, when it starts to
get older, they find that it bites and
makes a mess, so they throw up
their hands and call up their local
zoo and offer to donate the animal.
What people don’t understand 1s
that zoos generally aren’t geared to
take domesticated animals. So the
usual next step is a trip to the vet
for that ﬁnal shot.” .

Williams recounted an episode in
which he was notified that a family
had tired of a pet lion.

"We tracked the people down
and arrived at their house to take
the animal,” Williams said. ”But
when we got to the door, the wife
said, ‘Gee, you’re here a day too late
— my husband shot the lion
yesterday.’ I said, ‘Why did he shoot
it?’ and she said, ‘Because it didn’t
turn out to be what hegpectegl.’ . ‘_

angrily. “Fido the dog? People don’t

Many of theanimalsthe couple .

have taken in have been victims of .

abuse as well as neglect.

Although the family does not
consider the animals it has rescued
to be pets, there is obvious mutual
affection between human and
beast.

Williams estimates that for each
animal they have rescued and
made a part of their zoo, thousands
of others have been destroyed
because there was no place for
them. The Williamses hope to
eventually establish a natural sanc-
tuary for such animals and recently
purchased 22 acres of land in
central California —— "a start”
toward that dream, Williams said.

. He said people interested in
supporting that effort can write for

Great White Attacks on Marine Mammals Up.

Department of Fish and Game

biologists and wardens in the Mon- ,

terey area are reporting a higher
incidence of -marine mammal
deaths in recent months and attrib-

ute them to probable attacks by

great white sharks.
Seven sea otters have been re-

covered in the last 21/2 months that .

had sustained fatal injuries “most

probably” inflicted by great whites, _

the DFG said.
Marine mammals are the prima—
' ry forage of great whites, which are
knoWn to take their prey in a
‘. distinct manner that biologists can
identify. The DFG listed several
ii. recent incidents believed to have
. involved great white sharks in the
Monterey area: '
_ ——March 18: A confirmed sea
otter kill by a great white. Evi-
dence: Shark tooth fragments.
—March 28: Two great whites
were seen by coast Guard crew-
men feeding on a dead California
. gray whale.
—-March 31: A DFG warden

L sighted a “very large fin,” identify- .

ing it as belonging to a “probable”
great white shark.

 

The DFG has recently advised its
divers to follow procedures aimed
at minimizing the risk of shark
encounters during diving opera-
tions.

U

Besides adopting a controversial
mountain lion hunting proposal,

' the Fish and Game Commission has
made several other major changes

in California’s mammal hunting
regulations for 1987 -88.

Bighorn sheep will also go on the
big- game hunting list, for the first
time in more than a century. The
commission authorized the taking
of nine mature Nelson bighorn
rams by hunters, all from the Kelso
Peak-Old Dad Mountains area, and
from the Marble Mountains, both
Mojave Desert ranges.

Prospective bighorn hunters will
participate in a drawing for eight
$200 tags. The ninth will be auc-

tioned off to the highest bidder—a '

sum that could exceed $100,000—
with all funds going to California
bighorn management programs.

A major change in deer hunt
regulations is the splitting of Zone

X9 into two zones, X9a and X9b,
and a substantial reduction in the
number of tags issued for both. The
commission also authorized a
DFG-requested, special November
buck hunt in the Shasta Lake area.

Pronghorn antelope hunting
regulations remain largely the
same, except that buck and doe tag
numbers increase, from 550 to 630,
and from 135 to 150.

The lion hunt calls for a 79-day
’seasonbeginning Oct. 10, with 190
permits at $75 each, and hunting in
four zones, all in Central and
Northern California.

[3

A Montana taxidermist, desiring
anonymity, will receive a $1,000
reward from the National Audubon
Society for information that led to
the conviction of a man who ille-
gally killed 3 Montana grizzly bear.

The case stems from an investi-
gation by Montana game wardens
who were contacted by the taxi-
dermist after a grizzly hide was
presented to him for mounting.

After an investigation, William
Frankhauser of Barron, Wis, was

charged with two state game law
violations and fined $1,400. Frank-

hauser said he mistook the grizzly .,

for a black bear.

CI

The DFG’s recent bighorn sheep
census in the San Gabriel Moun-
tains resulted in an estimate of 700
Nelson bighorns, unchanged from
last year’s count.

Sherry Teresa, DFG wildlife bi-
ologist, described the does she
observed in the two-day helicopter
count as “fat, healthy and preg-
nanL”

Briefly Notes

A bill introduced in the State Legisla-
ture would permit Californians 62 or older
to fish in all lakes, rivers and streams
without a fishing license. Senior citizens
can now fish free from public piers. . . .

SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER - April 19, 1987

'Maraudingelk herds a headache for

 

‘ —B—yiKen Payton

l

MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVlCE

 

SACRAMENTO - Ranchers in Colusa,
Lake and Mendocino counties want some
thing done about stateprotected tule elk
herds that are eating their grain, damaging
fences and causing other expensive prob
lems.

Hunted nearly to extinction 80 years
ago, the elk have staged a comeback in the
past 65 years, with legislative help. Hunting
elk is prohibited. and for years the state
Department of Fish and Game has split

herds and moved animals to new areas as,

. they outgrew their habitats.

Now, says state Fish and Game biologist

. Don Koch, elk herds coming out of the

foothills west of the Sacramento Valley

I -. into some areas of Colusa, Lake and Mendo-
f’ cino counties are becoming an increasing

problem.
Tule elk can weigh 500 pounds, eat lots
of oats and alfalfa. and easily tear down

' fence posts and barbed wire.

Colusa County rancher Leo LaGrande
said he’s losing about $15,000 annually be-
cause marauding elk tear down fences and

. .lu-< -~-

prevent him from using about 30 percent
of his Salt Creek Ranch near_Williams to its
maximum. ,

During especially dry periods, tule elk
routinely graze with LaGrande’s livestock.

“They like green food,” Koch said, “and
they can get it year-round along the Teha-
ma-Colusa Canal.” ‘

Koch said about 100 elk are giving La-
Grande fits. They come from a herd of an
estimated 400 that regularly roam the
Cache Creek area of Lake County.

During dry, Cold weather, when there is
no grass to eat, many of the animals wan~
der the valley floor, often tearing down
fences and letting out cattle.

Jim Messersmith, regional Fish and
Game manager in Rancho Cordova, said
two steers that escaped LaGrande’s pas~
tures have been killed by cars on Highway
20. No people were hurt, but Messersmith
said LaGrande is worried about liability.

In Mendocino County’s Potter Valley,
one rancher figured elk damage had cost
him about $40,000, said Carre Brown of the
Mendocino Farm Bureau.

A 1971 law continued state protection
for tule elk. but said management of them
could ' be transferred to Fish and Game

when their statewide pepulation reaches
2,000.
In a report he’s preparing for the Legis-
lature, Koch estimates there are now 1,900
tule elk statewide, and the spring calf crop
might add 15 percent more animals. By this
summer, the total could be more than 2,100.

Turning tule elk management over to
Fish and Game experts could lead to hunts
by special permit to balance herds with
habitat.

Koch said his report will not recom- '
mend that elk hunting be allowed. That
might require a much more accurate count
of the animals.

Moreover, the state Fish and Game Com
mission is scheduled to adopt 1987 hunting
regulations in mid-April, so spring 1988 is
the soonest an elk hunting season could be
authorized.

Messersmith said LaGrande “is not into
shooting tule elk, so we‘re trying a lot of
different things“ to solve his problems with
the animals. ‘

So far, working with Messersmith, he
has tried herding the elk, shooting off fire-

crackers and firing guns that rice growers

use to scare off ducks, and flying helicOp-
ters in attempts to drive away the animals.

north state ranchers"?

x

Nothing has worked, Messersmith said.
They have even considered irrigating

It the foothills where elk normally live so
‘ grass might grow for them.

"We could transfer them," Messersmith
said, “but where? We‘d have to have con-
currence of the land owner, and it looks
like tule elk have almost worn out their
welcome." _

Transfer of surplus elk causing prob-
lems for any ranch would be required un-
der 3 bill preposed by Assemblyman Dan
Hauser, D-Arcata. Supported by the Men-
docino Farm Bureau and spurred by elk-
caused losses on a half-dozen ranches in
Potter Valley, Hauser’s measure would re-
quire the state to move any problem elk
into more suitable habitat Furthermore,
the bill, which has not yet been assigned to

. a legislative committee, says the state must

compensate ranchers for their losses.

The Potter Valley herd of about 30 elk
was first moved there from Owens Valley,
east of the Sierra Nevada. it did not take
the herd long to multiply to more than 75
animals and to roam 20 miles into the lush
valley, where there is usually plenty of
water and alfalfa.

“Most of the ranchers have to feed (their

animals) hay because the elk eat all the
grass,” said Brown. ‘. .

Richard Spotts, California representa-
tive of Defenders of Wildlife, said that

when he is asked about the growing elk

population and the possibility of elk hunt-
ing someday, “I just tell people (that) I see
the writing on the wall."

But Beulah Edmiston of the Committee
fer the Preservation of Tule Elk Opposes
hunting and believes tule elk should be _
allowed to increase. -

The Los Angeles County woman said she
cemes from a farm family and believes that.
most ranchers want to coexist with wildlife
as part of the ranching scene. California,
with its vast land areas, can always have
free roaming wildlife if elk and ether ani-
mal populations are balanced with natural
predators, she said. »

For example, she said, “the poor old
mountain lion is hungry and he‘s going to
get the weakest (elk) he can get,” leaving
the strongest animal in the herd. ’ -

But human elk hunters “would take an
(their) modern technology into the field .
and pull down the very best of the group? .i
leaving the weakest and least likely to sun-
VWe. ~ .

Road building sliced countryside
into ever—smaller units, and grow-
ing leisure pursuits disturbed the
most isolated nature sanctuaries.

Herbicides and pesticides, which
deprived birds of insects, lizards
and other prey, added to the diffi-
culties.

Orchards, once a secondary hab-
itat for many small birds, were
sprayed as often as 20 times a
year with chemicals and “have be-
come deserts in the landscape,”
Berthold said.

Birds were ﬁnding it ever more

difficult to raise their broods. They I

had to cover larger distances in
search of food for their young and
in bad weather broods often died
of hunger.

Even when conditions in the

breeding areas were right, things »

became critical during migration.
Rest areas were becoming smaller
and more barren,»meaning less
food and more competition.

West Germany could help
migratory birds by. making unculti-
vated land available to them,
Berthold said, but not in the pres-
ent form of small, isolated nature
reserves.

Berthold said help could be ef-
fective only through a close ecolo-
gical network. Every West Ger-
man": community wouflti have to

on pigeons

, By DON HARRIS

The Arizona Republic

Pigeons are dropping like
ﬂies at the state Capitol.

Long considered a nuisance,
the bold birds have been splat-‘
tering visitors indiscriminately
-- Democrats and Republicans
alike. .

What’s more, their drop-
pings plug up downspouts lead-
ing from the Capitol roof,

. causing minidams after it rains
’ and resulting in leakage inside

the building. ‘
State workers tried to scare
the pigeons away with shot-

. gunlike sounds, but it didn’t

work.

So now, a chemical mix
containing a poisonous sub-
stance is being sprinkled in the
areas where the pigeons perch.
The toxins are absorbed into
the bloodstream through the
birds’ claws, and the rest is
history.

Sen. Peter Kay, an east
Phoenix Republican, rose on

' the Senate floor Friday to call

his colleagues’ attention to ‘the
mass annihilation of pigeons
around our Capitol.”

Kay said he arrived at work
at 7:30 am. Friday and saw

~ "the death squad” cleaning UP

pigeon carcasses. He said he
was told by state employees
that 50 had been shot the
previous night.

Kay protested that “what
they drop” is “only a natural
function, and they shouldn’t be
murdered for it.”

“The pigeon families are in
mourning,” he said. "It’s a sad
day, and I wanted you to share
in our grief.”

Dave Hall, an assistant di-
rector at the Department of
Administration, denied that
the birds were being shot. Guns
were ﬁred to scare them, Hall
said.

Len Jackson, legislative
building manager, said the
chemical being used "can kill
young ones, old ones and some
of the weaker ones.” ’

For the more robust pigeons,
Jackson said, the chemical
annoys them so much that they

DAYTON DAILY NEWS/ JOURNAL HERALD - May S, 1987

Editorial’s statementSWere crazier than pit bulls

I read the Dayton Daily
News and Journal Herald’s
April 25 editorial concerning
pit bull dogs and some of the
statements in it were the most
ridiculous things I have ever
seen.

For instance, the statement
that pit bulls are responsible
for the largest number of
deaths by dogs because they
are bred to act crazy.

I have been involved with
pit bulls and breeders of pit
bulls for many years, and I
know for a fact that the ma-
jority of breeders actually
breed with friendly and stable
temperaments among their
main objectives. Any pit bull
that does act crazy does so be-
cause of the way it was raised
and trained, not because it
was bred that way. It is im-
possible to breed any dog to
act crazy, much less a pit bull.

The statement that pit bulls
don’t belong anywhere out-
side of a zoo is even more ri-
diculous. I have known many
pit bulls whose owners have
properly raised and socialized
them and they are the most
friendly and trustworthy
dogs in the world. On the oth-
er hand, I know some owners
who keep their dogs chained

up and don’t allow them to.

socialize with any people or
dogs. Those dogs are vicious
as any other breed would be if
kept in those conditions.

I think the editorial writers
should get their facts straight
before they start writing
about things they know noth-
ing about.

EARL C. JENKINS
Dayton

Law will help

After all that has been
written about pit bulls lately,
how could the editorial, “Vi-
cious dog bill won’t end pit
bulldog problem” be written?

The dog is a pit bull terrier
not a pit bull dog. That 270-
pound Kettering man died of a
heart attack after being
mauled by two pit bulls. The
editorial writer still cannot
understand that a dangerous
and vicious dog law is the cor-
rect procedure for protecting

 

 

 

 

the public against all dogs
that pose a threat to people
and their property.

The pit bull is not the prob-
lem. The people who mistreat
these dogs are the problem. If
you didn’t have pit bulls,
these people would use dogs
such as the Rottweiler. A 110-
pound Rottweiler can inflict

' more damage to a child or

adult in five minutes than any
50-pound pit bull.

The editorial showed fear
and ignorance toward pit
bulls, a breed no more vicious
towards people than any oth-
er dog if raised properly. Say-
ing “pit bulls don’t belong
anywhere outside of a zoo”
displays an amateurish ability
to write and shows you didn’t
do your homework before

' writing an editorial.

PHYLLIS SCHOLP
Centerville

Truly terriﬁed

. . .With all the recent nega-
tive indoctrination, my pit
bull began to wonder if she
was wimpy. So, to give me a
little test, she ran upstairs to
my bedroom when the door

was inadvertently left open.
As I came out of the bath-
room to don my work clothes
that were on the bed, there
lay my pit bull on top of them!

7 Normally, according to my

philosophy, I should have
yelled, “Get off of my clothes,
and get back in your bed,”
and then smacked her hard
with my hand.

Alas, the media have pene-
trated my philosophy. It was
a stare down.

I called my boss and told
him I would be late to work
— the pit bull was on my
clothes.

LENORA STAMPER
Huber Heights

Poorly done

I read the brief life story in
the Dayton Daily News and
Journal Herald of Dr. Will-
iam Eckman who was recent-
1y killed in the pit-bull attack.
The media had their priorities
confused when they were so
quick to run stories on Joetta
Darmstedter, complete with
interviews consuming most of
the evening TV news, as well
as front-page coverage with
photOgraphs and the typical
story of a prostitute. All of
this was long before anything
was told about the unfortu-
nate circumstances of the
victim.

A prostitute’s dog kills a lo-

cal doctor and she becomes a
celebrity in the eyes of the
media. I believe the public
would have rather heard the
story of the death of an area
doctor than that of a street-
walker who has done nothing
for the community. . . .
. Whether her story is true
or not, the news was that a
long-time area physician was
killed. The unfortunate cir-
cumstances behind what may
have led to his death made it
even more newsworthy.

I think the media should
choose their priorities a bit
more carefully and should
show more consideration for
their customers instead of in-
sulting our intelligence.

Europe
losing its
songbirds

By Stanley Parker

BONN (Reuters)-—Europe’s
dawnchorus of bird song is losing
ﬁne Singers at an alarming rate.

Man’s destruction of his natural .
envrronmcnt is taking a heavy toll ’
of Europe’s small birds. Many
have become rare or have disap-
peared altogether from their old
habitats.

The latest alarm was sounded by
theMax Planck Institute for Be—
havroral Physiology after an un-
usually comprehensive study of
migratory songbirds.

The 10-year study, led by profes-
sor Peter Berthold and counting
on a legion of volunteer helpers,
found that 26 of 37 types of birds
were dwindling steadily.

iny rarely were bluethroats,
whmchats, great reed warblers and
aquatic warblers seen, pointing to
a. catastrophic collapse of the spe-
Cies.

The decline in numbers of many
large birds had been well known
for decades but the parallel drop
in smaller species,.whosc size
made them harder to observe, had
until now often rested on little
more than suspicions. '

During the 10-year Max Planck
program, catch ﬁgures for several
small species fell dramatically. In
two catchment areas, for example,
the number of great reed warblers
fell from 740 at the start to 210 in
the last year of the program,
Berthold said. '

In other catchment areas the
number of bluethroats fell from
100 to 30, the lesser whitethroats
from 300 to 50 and the blackbirds
from 420 to 150, he said.

At this rate, Berthold warned,
ormthologists would ﬁnd their nets
empty of migratory songbirds by
the year 2030.

To conduct the study, lines of
nets were strung at three undis—
turbed sites, the Mettnau peninsu-
la on Lake Constance, the Reit
nature sanctuary near Hamburg
and Illmitz in Austria. They oper—
ated from June 30 to Nov. 6 each
year, ensuring that early and late
migratory birds from central and
northern Europe were counted.

Altogether, the researchers han—
dled some 250,000 birds, including
200.000 never previously caught
and ringed.

Regardie ’3 ’ Revelations

0f Gun Lobby Inﬁghting

By Charles Trueheart

Washington Post Staff Writer

As the National Rifle Association looks
forward to its annual convention in Reno,
Nev., on April 25, photocopiers across the

 

 

land are bound to be ﬂashing and clicking out ,

private editions of Dan Moldea's re r '
April Regardie’s. p0 tm the
. What Moldea discloses about the organiza-
tion_ should come as a surprise to those
outsrde its ranks who have regarded the NRA
as a monolithic progun lobby with titanic
political power. More to the point, parts of
the story may even come as a shock to many
of the association’s 3 million members.
They’ve certainly heard about power strug-
gles in the leadership, but probably not as
much as Moldea has discovered and pieced
together. '

Neither space nor patience permits a full
rendering of the byzantine intrigues that fol-
lowed the decision of the NRA’s former chief
operating officer, Executive Vice President
Harlon Carter, to step down two years ago,
and his carefully orchestrated installment of
G. Ray Arnett as his successor.

But the story includes tales of violations of ’
federal hunting laws and the NRA's own
firearm etiquette by Arnett (he was filming an
[m the NRA” commercial at the time); the
cozy relationship between the NRA and the
Reagan administration, whence came Arnett;
the efforts of two NRA life members to
expose a character reference Arnett gave on
behalf of a convicted drug dealer; and Ar-
nett's dramatic dismissal by the NRA board

, Resuming the

Whale Hunt

Disgruntled American trade
officials will tell you that the
Japanese have made an art of
saying one thing (“We will buy
more US. products”) and doing
the opposite (clinging to protec-
tionist policies). Now wildlife
activists are learning that
when it comes to breaking with
established practice, the Jap-
anese can be very stubborn
indeed. Last March Japan de-
clared that it would end com-
mercial whaling in Antarctica,
a major hunting ground, to
comply with a moratorium on
the business organized by the
International Whaling Com-
mission. Last week Japan an-
nounced that it would resume
whale hunting in Antarctica
this year for “research pur-
poses.” Since there are no inter-
national quotas on research
hunting, the move effectively
exploits a legal loophole.
Tokyo said it intends to kill
875 whales—nearly half the
number Whalers caught during
the last commercial season. Af-
ter studying the lifespan and
pregnancy rate of the mam-
mals, Japan will sell the meat
on food markets. Japan aims to

 

 

 

 

 

 

show that hunting has not seri-
ously threatened the whale
population, as the IWC con-
tends. "We want to prove that
there is no danger of extinc-
tion,” said an official of Japan’s
ﬁshery agency. Wildlife activ-
ists disagree, and they de-
nounced the move as merely
"commercial whaling under
another name.”

By resuming the hunt, Japan
has courted the wrath of en-
vironmentalists in order to
protect an old and marginal
business (only 3,000 people cur-
rently work in Japan’s shrink-
ing whaling industry). Like
their country’s heavily subsi-
dized agricultural industry, the
Japanese consider whaling a

More Than 50 Face Hunting Charges

Offenses in 3 States Range From Poaching to Unlawﬁrl Mounting

 

By Tom Vesey
Washingtim Punt Staff Writer

 

ANNAPOLIS, April 6—Police
and federal wildlife ofﬁcers today
charged more than 50 hunters and
hunting guides in Maryland, Virgin-
ia and Delaware with crimes rang-
ing from poaching to illegally stuff-
ing and mounting game animals.

The charges ended three under-
cover investigations into illegal
hunting on Maryland's Eastern

National Park.

The type of illegal hunting that
was charged is widespread around
the country, according to federal
wildlife officials.

 

l W

the Shenandoah park, where all
hunting is prohibited. ‘

Inez Connor, a spokeswoman for
the US. Fish and Wildlife Service,
said undercover agents—including
Maryland officers because local res-
idents did not know them—accom-
panied poachers on night hunting
expeditions in the park, while uni—
formed park rangers watched from
a distance.

Those charged “were just people
who lived in the area who thought
they could make a little money by
selling fur and meat,” Connor said.

Connor said park rangers “could
sense but could not tell” that illegal
hunting had been going on in the
park and had asked federal author-
ities to launch an undercover inves-
tigation.

Connor said officers sometimes
posed as hunters and sometimes
approached suspects and asked for

help in obtaining bear and deer
. meat and fur.

 

Shore and in Virginia’s Shenandoah

In one case covering Maryland
and Delaware, Maryland Natural
Resources police filed 444 charges
against 31 hunters and hunting
guides, alleging they had hunted
deer and rabbit at night with spot-
lights, hunted out of season, fraud-
ulently tagged deer, bought fur

without a license and stuffed and

mounted Canada geese and other
waterfowl, hawks and owls without
a license.

The Maryland police said they

tember 1985 after hearing hunters
boasting of killing large numbers of
deer. '

They said they disguised them~
selves as hunters and saw deer, red

launched their investigation in Sep- ‘

fox, geese and rabbits killed illegally
in both Maryland and Delaware.

After a separate two-year probe,
US. Fish and Wildlife Service of-
ficers filed charges against 11 com-
mercial hunting guides and three
hunting services on the Eastern
Shore.

The charges, included hunting
after hours, using illegal weapons,’
exceeding hunting limits, fraudulent
tagging of waterfowl and the illegal
sale of mounted Canada geese and
other waterfowl.

In Virginia, 11 hunters from the
Luray area were arrested ~ on
charges of illegally killing, possess-
ing and selling white-tailed deer,
bear and other animals taken from ‘

f-x

 

 

 

 

 

If convicted, the suspects could
face penalties ranging from a $500
fine for minor offenses to a $20,000
fine and five years in prison for sell-
ing illegal deer meat across state
lines.

David Price, a Centreville, Md.,
goose-hunting guide, said he was
charged with two counts of selling
illegally mounted Canada geese and
two counts of shooting geese from
the cab of his truck.

He denied the shooting charge
but said he had sold two mounted

{geese that belonged to his father,
. not knowing it was illegal.

Price said he sold the “stuffers”
to a shoe salesman from Boston
who hunted with him every year.

“He was a good customer and he
paid good,” Price said. “He was the
last one in the world I’d have
thought could be a federal agent

. . . . I won’t send him no brochures
next time.”

the suburban Stone Zoo is functional
but uninspired. Still, it manages to
draw half a million visitors each year.
Franklin Park is another story. Its
problems begin with its Dorchester ad-
dress. “The neighborhood is a de-
militarized zone,” says Loew, “like
Gaza.” Attendance last year was
around fifty thousand visitors, fewer
than the Patriots might draw for'a mid—
season game with the Colts. This is
partly because the place has few ani—
mals left. In 1982, investigations by
both the Massachusetts Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and
the US. Department of Agriculture
determined that Franklin Park was
woefully overcrowded. As a result,
many of the 200’s 840 animals are now
on loan to other facilities; the remain-
der live in large open pens enclosed by
industrial fencing. The antelope play
on a hill overlooking a liquor store.
Both Franklin Park and the Stone
Zoo are owned and ﬁnanced by the
~ state, with funds distributed through
the MDC. When you consider that
this agency is also responsible for pro-
viding such basic services as water and
police protection to 2.5 million people,

it’s not surprising that the zoos get lost .

in the shufﬂe. “When I first came on in
nineteen eighty-three, I was hit with
the clean-up of Boston Harbor,” ex—
plains MDC Commissioner William
Geary. “That was a two- to three-
billion-dollar project. The zoos were
not even a separate line item in my
budget.”

Today, Geary is sympathetic to the
zoos, but even so, their $3.2 million
annual budget is not even half what the
two institutions need. Financial prob-
lems are exaggerated by a management
agreement between the MDC and the
BZS that would make sense only in a
monkey house. The nonprofit BZS is
responsible for day-to-day operations
around the zoos, yet it has no authority
over MDC employees, who account
for most of the staff. Since these are the
people who execute those day-to—day
functions, the whole setup is pretty
cockeyed.

Then there’s plain old mismanage-
ment, the most obvious example of
which is the long-awaited tropical
forest pavilion, which was supposed to

 

be the centerpiece at Franklin Park.
Construction on the empty shell was
begun in 1978, as part of a four-pavil-
ion showcase for animals of the African
continent. Plans called for climate-con—
trolled, natural environments that

' would re—create a tropical forest, a bush

forest, a desert, and a savannah. Total

cost was estimated at $13 million.
Today, nine years later, only the

shell of the tropical forest has been

. erected. The interior is now scheduled

for completion in 1989, and the price

, tag will run to about $26 million. Once .
proclaimed the exhibit that would
modernize Franklin Park, the pavilion

has instead become a monument to
political inertia.

LMOST EVERYONE in the zoo
world agrees that the solu-
tion to years of neglect is a

world—class director. The BZS (and
thus the zoos) has been without a di-
rector since 1985, and when the MDC
advertised for a new management team

to resolve the problems between the
MDC and the BZS, no one replied.

The situation in Boston has been

gummed up for so long that zoo pros '

won’t come near it. Explains Palmer
Krantz, director of the respected River-
bank Zoo in Columbia, South Carolina,
“I would be very leery about coming
to Boston, and I think any director
worth having would be, too.”

According to Frank Loew, that’s
where Tufts comes in. “We can offer
an unparalleled intellectual environ—
ment,” Loew says, “and the kind of
salary that metropolitan zoo directors
have come to expect. ” An interim team
from the Philadelphia Zoo has been
hired by the MDC to develop a new
management plan, and the tropical
pavilion is once again under construc-
tion. “It’s going to.be the Larry Bird of
zoos,” predicts Loew. ,

Initially, Tufts wanted to help create
a management team for both Stone
and Franklin Park this summer. The
deal hinged on money. According to
Loew, the university wanted a finan-
cial commitment from the legislature.
According to others, the deal never got

that far, but was hung up in wrangling ‘

 

 

 

over the allocation of funds for the vet

~ school itself. In any case, Beacon Hill

has‘ yet to increase the 2005’ budget,
and Tufts is unwilling to commit to the
project as things now stand. “We’ll
give our energy and our hearts,” says
Loew. “But we won’t dive into the
shallow end of the pool.”

What’s expected to happen now is
this: sometime in the current session,
Governor Michael Dukakis will pro—
pose legislation to create a nonprofit
organization to hire a director and

f manage the zoos. Tufts will be an im-
portant component — but not the only

component — in the new arrange-
ment. “I’m still optimistic about the
future of the 2005,” says Loew, “but I
wish it was moving along faster.”

He is not alone. Says Robert Wag-
ner, executive director of the American
Association of Zoological Parks and
Aquariums in Wheeling, West Vir-
ginia, “If a total commitment isn’t
there, the zoo ought to be closed down
and turned into a golf course. Either

get into the profession or get out.”

Welcome to the
Monkey House

Nothing at Boston’s zoos makes sense,
especially their years of mismanagement

R. FRANKLIN Loew,
who is dean of the Tufts
University School of
Veterinary Medicine,
appears to be a mas—
ochist. For the past year, Tufts has been
discussing with the Metropolitan Dis—
trict Commission a plan whereby
Tufts would help manage the Boston
Metropolitan Zoos — the seventy-
five-acre Franklin Park Zoo in Dor-
Chester and the smaller Stone Zoo in
Stoneham. One might wonder why.

 

Franklin Park and the Stone are two of
the least respected zoos in the country:
in 1984, the Humane Society of the
United States placed Franklin Park on
its “ten worst” list. That honor under-
scored what members of the Boston
Zoological Society have known for
years: when it comes to zoos, the Hub
is strictly minor league. As Loew puts
it, “Being a member of B28 is like
watching the Cleveland Indians.”

All the same, Loew is attracted to
the challenge of turning around the

 

zoos. “Enlightened self—interest,” he
says, is the reason why. Tufts would
be the first university in the country to
participate in the management of a
metropolitan zoo, and the eight-year-
old veterinary schoOl would thus be
established as a leader in the study of
medicine for exotic species.

When it was ﬁrst announced in April
of 1986, many, including Loew, in-
terpreted this deal as a sign of op-
timism for the beleaguered zoos. After
a year of dickering, however, Loew
has come to one conclusion: “This
won’t be accomplished,” he says,
“without some heavy lifting.”

T’s NOT as if the Boston zoos
couldn’t use some optimism.
With a limited number of animals,

Big Apple welcomes pandas
Ling Ling, Yong Yong visiting New York, New York

By Christine Lyons
Special for USA TODAY

NEW YORK — There will
be Panda-monium in the Big
Apple on Thursday.

Two giant pandas on loan
from China — Ling Ling and
Yong Yong — are to go on dis-
play at the Bronx Zoo.

Manhattanite Maebeth Fen-
ton. 39, said she’ll be among the
ﬁrst of the 1 million panda fans
the zoo expects over the next
three months.

“Pandas look so sweet and
trusting and the big, dark spots
in their eyes make them seem
so sad. You" just want to cuddle
them,” said Fenton.

“They’re just so cute,” said
zookeeper Laurie Thomas, 29.
“This is a once-in-a-lifetime ex-
perience to tell your grandchil-
dren about” ,

The pandas arrived April 18
via a 20-hour, ﬁrst-class night
from Peking and will be quar-
antined until Thursday.

“They seem to like it here.
They’re just like baby humans
-— romping around trees and
rolling in the grass,” said zoo di-
rector William Conway.

The pandas each eat 40
pounds of bamboo a day. Sup-
plies will come from Georgia.

Their home will be a 50-by-
70 foot amphitheater with
grass, a waterfall and pool.

Ling Ling, a 119-pound male,
was born 1% years ago at the
Peking Zoological Gardens.
Yong Yong, a l87—pound fe-
male, was rescued as an aban-
doned infant in the wilds al-
most six years ago.

It’s Yong Yong’s second trip
to the USA; she had visited Los
Angeles for the 1984 Olympics.

With up to 2,000 panda fans
per hour expected, the zoo will
sell tickets for speciﬁc viewing
times at $1 for adults and 50
cents for children.

Pandas, an endangered spe-
cies, have lived in China’s
mountain forests for 600,000
years. There are an estimate
800 left. ; ’

Population boom A
of ‘ferocious ’ toads

haps in to region
'._. "V. 1en a'sked ‘zwv twig rhe‘toads'

By MICHAEL D. DUNN
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA — How would you like
to encounter a toad as big as a foot-
ball?

You just might.

Giant bufo marinas toads have
been proliferating in' Central and
South Florida, and residents say
they’re not a, pretty sight.

Biologists are warning people
not to handle the toads. They se-
crete a toxic fluid that can kill dogs
and cats and make humans sick.
The poison also can cause severe
vision problems if rubbed in one’s
eyes.

“My God, have you seen these
things? They’re huge. I was stabbing
them to death with a pitchfork. You
have to because their skin is so
thick,” said Tampa resident Carlene
Rondeau, who lives in the Palma
Ceia area.

“In the spring, they start.
They’ve progressively gotten
worse,” she said. “If it rains, it’s like
raining frogs.’

Exact populations of the toad
haven’ t been determined, but
they’ve been found in Hillsborough,
Pinellas, Dade, Monroe, Broward
and Palm Beach counties, said her-
petologist David Auth of the Florida
State Museum in Gainesville.

“Populations seem to be quite
dense. With all the canals in Tampa
and St. Pete, they’ll do very Well,”
Auth said. “They’re very hardy
creatures.”

The toads can grow as long as 12
inches and weigh as much as 3
pounds. Glands next to their eyes
contain highly toxic poison, called
bufo toxin, which can kill animals
who eat the toads or ingest the flu-
id, according to biologist Henry Mu-
shinsky of the University of South
Florida.

“They’re ferocious predators,”
Mushinsky said. “They’ll eat other
frogs, lizards, even small mice and
maybe small birds. There’s a huge

“I’d say 21/2 to 3 pounds,” he -

 

,‘,_

said. “They’re nocturnal animals. If
you look around your yard around
sunset, that’s the best time to see
the.’m’

J emy Hinton, Hillsborough Coun-
ty cooperative extension agent, said
she’s received calls from homeown-
ers concerned about the toads. Resi-
dents are afraid their pets will eat
them and die.

“I’ve had calls from several ar-
eas of the county,” she said. “.If
someone calls and says they have a
toad the size of a dinner plate, we
know what it'is. I tell people to go

ahead and kill them, if you can fig- .1

ure out a way to kill them.”

The toads like dog food and cat ..

food, so they sometimes hop into a
pet’s food bowl and the pet unwit-

tmgly takes a bite of bufo marinas

instead of Purina, Hinton said.

Most dogs and cats won’t bite
them, but there have been dog- and
cat-related deaths, she said.

Auth said the toads, whiCh are
native to South America, were intro-
duced deliberately in Florida in the
19305 as way to control sugar cane
pests in Belle Glade. That didn’t
work well, he said, but the idea was
tried again in 1944 in the sugar cane
fields of Clewiston.

Current populations probably
were introduced via Miami, an im-
port center for many species of ani-
mals, Auth said.

The toads need warm tempera-
tures, Mushinsky said, and they
have proliferated locally because of
recent mild winters.

“Temperature will limit them.
This is about as far North as you’ll
find them,” Mushinsky said. “We
seem to be right on the border of
what they can stand in winter tem-
peratures ”

Rondeau said her husband al-

’ ready has killed four of the toads

this spring, and she’s not looking
forward to more of them in her
neighborhood this summer.

“They’re icky. You just sit back
and wham them,” she said. “It’s a
definite problem. They’re a pain in
the neck, and they’re dangerous.”

In Woman's Cur .

' ‘ By Erik Ingram

A large bobcat was recov-
ering from surgery yesterday
after scaring the daylights out
of a Bolinas woman who acci-
d'entally drove over the ani-
mal, then tossed the unmov-
ing carcass into her car to get
the pelt.

The unidentified woman was
nearly home when the limp 25.
pound ball of fur on her back seat
came back to life with an angry
growl.

“If he hadn’t had a pelvic
fracture, he would have torn her

apart," saidveterinarian Ray Dei- ‘

wildcat at his Bolinas animal hos-
pital.

asked him to remove the snarling,

"He has a growl to match his

“We put plates, wires, screws

CHICAGO TRIBUNE - April 24, 1987

 

Voice ofthe peOpIe

. A day to ~”focus on plight of lab animals

CHICAGO—Why is this “World Day” for
laboratory animals?

Because millions of animals die every year as a
hedge against human disease, illness and death.
This societal mandate stimulates—and justiﬁes in
the public mind—an unprecedented exploitation
of animals in research, educational and testing
laboratories. But this traditional animal sacrifice
before the altar of science goes far beyond what is
medically, ethically and morally necessary to
protect and promote the public health.

The numbers are staggering. The federal
government reports an annual “kill” of 17 million
to 22 million animals in public and private
laboratories across the nation, but unofficial
estimates reach a staggering 80 million. For
decades, the helpless laboratory animal has been
the unwilling surrogate for us in testing everything
from new antibiotics to hair spray for the
consumer.

The lab animal has been bred to “model” every
human condition, including “shiverer mice” for
multiple sclerosis studies, deliberately brain-
injured baboons to develop therapeutic procedures
for crash victims, and maternally deprived female
monkeys who become purveyors of “human”
violence on their innocent newborn.

Indeed, the laboratory animal has become
society’s “whipping boy,” ofﬁcial “taster” and
human “model” as it mirrors an increasingly
grotesque image of a human society ﬂeeing from
its own humanity.

What have we gained from the deaths of
millions of laboratory animals since the dawn of
modern medicine following World War ll? While
medical research can proudly point to a few
landmark victories in the battleagainst dreaded
illnesses and diseases, most of the supposed
medical advances in the 20th Century have
contributed little to the health of our nation. For
example, a recent Boston University study

discovered that while a fall in mortality rates due
to 11 infectious diseases accounted for 40 percent
of an overall 69 percent decrease in the 20th
Century, only 3.5 percent of that decline was the
result of medical measures. As any public health
official would claim, the improved national health
in the last .87 years was mostly due to improved
sanitation and hygiene, education, social and
welfare programs, better diet and more money.

Millions of human as well as lab animal lives
can be spared if our biomedical and public health ‘
establishments shift their priorities from a pursuit
of cures to that of prevention—for example, the
link between cancer and smoking. -

But the dramatic successes of a distant past
have breathed independent life into today’s
undeserving biomedical enterprise as it continues
to stumble in translating research dollars into
effective health care delivery. Now. part of a
multibillion—dollar industry with competitive
advantage as its primary catalyst, the lab animal
fuels the engine of success for the academic
scientist and the industrialist.

The mythic glamor of the lone, dedicated ’
scientist struggling to save humankind is not real. .
But the fear of illness, disease and death has '
become a “reversible” reality in the collective
mind of the American population. It creates a
lexicon of socially acceptable language to allow the ”
“sacrifice” of millions of animals in “service” to ‘1‘
mankind. -»

World Day commemorates the common fabric ' "
of being that encompasses all life, particularly the
brutalized laboratory animal.» Hopefully, it Will
awaken the public to how this utilitarian use of

rl

b

animals not only does little to protect our health, . ~

but that it compromises our quality of life by
degrading the human character.

BOSTON GLOBE

Deer lovers go BOnkers
in Vt. to—do over doe

By Yvonne Daley
Special to the Globe

SHOREHAM Vt. - When Ellen
Malone complained to state offi—
cials about Bonkers, a semiwild
- white-tailed deer who liked to butt
her as she jogged near her Shore-
ham farm, she hardly expected

the wrath she was about to re-,

ceive.
Since Malone called the Ver-

mont Department of Fish and .

Wildlife about two weeks ago to
ask that Bonkers be relocated, she
said, she has received threatening
phone calls. unpleasant mail and
a couple of thinly disguised sug-
gestions about her safety and that
of her dog.

“’Ive received letters and a lot
of phone calls making me out to be
a madwoman."‘Malone said. “One
person suggested that the problem
was my dog and that the best so-
lution might be to shoot the dog.”

The issue has been well—publi-
cized locally. About 600 residents
of the towns of Shoreham, Orwell
and Whiting have signed petitions
opposing the deer's relocation,
and Malone has unwittingly be-
come targeted as a deer hater.

“To the contrary; I like
Bonkers a lot. The first’time she
came out to me, it was magical. I
didn’t know what I’d done to be so
lucky. But the deer has maladjust—
ed behavior. The most humane
thing to do, I think. would be to
relocate it” to a petting 200 or con-
servation camp, she said.

Malone explained that as she
jogs down the road, Bonkers likes
to zigzag in front of her, some-
times playfully butting her or her
malamute dog. And other times.
the 2-year-old deer plays hide-and-
seek, hiding in the woods along

the road and jumping out at Ma--

lone suddenly. Twice Bonkers has

knocked Malone down by jumping’

on her from behind, she says, and
once Bonkers jumped on her dog.r
Bonkers was taken as a fawn

 

by someone who found her in the
woods and assumed she had been
orphaned. The person was appar-
ently ignorant of state laws pro—
hibiting taking of wild animals.

For six months, Bonkers lived
in an apartment. But when she
grew too rambunctious, her keep-
er contacted game warden Dens-
more Gaiotti, who brought her to
his Shoreham farm

Bonkers adjusted well and
Gaiotti hoped she would return to
the wild, but her association, or
imprinting, was to humans and
dogs rather to her own species,
and she hung around. '

Bonkers isn’t. exactly tame.
She roams a more than 5-square-

mile area. She disappears for y

131%?

weeks at a time and there is even

speculation she may be pregnant. ;
The Gaiottis said they’ve never

AprilD22,j1987

seen Bonkers be anything more

than playful And the neighbors

want the deer to stay, and suggest

that Malone jog somewhere else.

But Malone, who is serious

about her jogging, argues all the
other nearby roads are too hilly
and, besides, she feels she has a
right to jog anywhere she wants.
Fish and Wildlife Commission—
er Steven Wright said he has not
reached a decision ‘on what to do
about Bonkers or on whether one

of his department employees has.

broken the state law against keep—
ing a wild animal.

In the meantime, the Gaiottis
think the whole thing has been
blown out of proportion and could
have been avoided if Malone had
informed them as soon as Bonkers
started acting rambunctious.

And Malone, 33, sitting" in her
living room, wonders whether the
greater threat is from Bonkers the
deer or from those who have gone
bonkers over Bonkers.

“I have a real fear that I or my
dog will be injured by the deer or
by someone who wants to protect
the deer,” Malone said.

DEKALB NEWS/SUN - Atlanta - April 22, 198_7__

Caged, Mulzled And. Leashed
Board Hammers Out

By STEVE TEASLEY

DeKalb County ﬁnally has a law
designed to protect its citizens
against dangerous dogs.

Members of the county commis-
sion last week worked out the
details of an ordinance that re-
quires owners of such animals to
take speciﬁc precautions against
,their pets attacking humans or
other animals.

Those who ignore the regula-
tions for keeping dangerous ani-
mals can be ﬁned up to $500 and
sentenced to up to 30 days in jail.

. The commission has been talk-
ing about strengthening its animal
control laws for the past five

months.

Dan

The legislation was prompted by
the death last November of a south
DeKalb four-year-old. He was
mauled by three pit bull terriers
belonging to a neighbor.

The bulk of the new ordinance
was provided by a citizens advisory
committee, whose membership in-
cluded several animal behavior ex-
perts.

The county commission made a
few changes in the citizen panel’s
proposals during previous prelimi-
nary discussions. And, it was one
more of those small points of disa-
greement between the board and
the committee that kept the two
sides in debate right up to the ﬁnal

vote at the April 16 commission
meeting.

IN AN EFFORT to make sure
that no dangerous animals were
ever loose - on or off the owner’s
property, the commission appar-
ently by mistake changed a com-
mittee recommendation and made
it illegal for any dog to be off-leash
at any time.

Realizing the problem after
hearing from committee members,
Commissioner Bob Morris said just
before voting on the new proposal,
“As it stands with this (suggested
legislation), I can’t go home and let
my dog out in the yard unless I

have him on a leash. ”c -. - -
‘12.. ”‘ﬂﬁfr. .-.

Animal Low

DeKalb Chief Executive Ofﬁcer

Manuel Maloof agreed that “in all
fairness, if it’s not a dangerous
animal we ought to go ahead and
ﬁx this now...”

The legislation was changed to
permit ordinary, non-threatening
dogs to be outside without a leash -
only on the oWner’s property - if
under voice control of a “compe-
tent person.”

Commissioner Brince Manning
voted against the ordinance,
largely because he didn’t feel it’s
restrictive enough.

“I’m concerned with dogs eating
up people,” he explained.

NO VICIOUS dog will be per-
mitted off-leash on an owner’s
property.

In fact, the new law requires
dangerous animals to be kept in-
side a pen with a top, and the pen
must be within a fenced perimeter
area.

On leash on the owner’s prop-
erty, the dangerous animal’s leash
can be no longer than four feet and
it must be under control of a
person. It cannot be leashed to a
tree or other inanimate object. The
dog must also be muzzled.

Owners of dangerous ~ animals
also have to take certain special
precautions for keeping their pets
indoors and for transporting them.

The law deﬁnes a dangerous
animal as “any animal which con- '
stitutes a physical threat to human
beings or other domesticated ani- ,
mals by virtue of a known propens-
ity to endanger life or by an unpro-
voked assault or bite so as to cause .
serious bodily harm’

The commissioners picked the .
advisory committee’ s legislation 'j
over three other laws that individ-
ual board members and the county
legal staff had produced before the
panel was selected.

The board majority was un-
happy with all those. And last
week, after adopting the citizen
committee’s provisions, it tabled
the other three measures.

Fla. mouse

The Associated Press

GAINESVILLE — Although
few Floridians have ever seen
the big brown eyes and the little
pink ears of the elusive Florida
mouse, it is the only species of
mammal found exclusively in
the state. Now, deveIOpment is
threatening its habitat.

The tiny burrowing rodent
was once widely distributed up
and down Florida’s Atlantic
Coast and throughout the sand-
hills of the state’s interior.

But it has disappeared from
the Miami area, from the Pinel-
las peninsula and from thou-
sands of acres along the Lake
Wales Ridge, say those who have
studied the creature.

“It’ s not that anyone is hurting
this little mouse,” said Cheri
Jones, a University of Florida
student doing her doctoral dis-
sertation on Florida mice. “It’s
just that over the past few de-
cades sandhills and scrublands
have been going to orange
groves, pastures and housing u».
velopments. ”

Listed by the state as threat-

' ened —- a designa ion not quite

as serious as endangered— the

brown- and gold- -furred crea--

tures mostly share quarters with
gopher tortoises, said Jones.

Gopher tortoises dig burrows
up to 18 feet long in the state’s
well-drained, sandy uplands.

“The mice dig little side en-
trances and escape routes,” said
Jones. “The tortoise does the
bulk of the work, and the mice
move in and do a little remodel-
ing of their own.”

Scrubby uplands, because

they are high and dry, are be- ‘

coming increasingly attractive

fﬂorkkinuce

to builders now that much of the
more popular hammock areas
have been developed. And unlike
in wetlands, development in the
sandhills is largely unregulated,
said James N. Layne, the senior
research biologist at the Arch-
is} . Biological Station in Lake
:‘id.

Even sparse deveIOpment,
says Layne, is bad news for the
Florida mouse because it re-
quires a habitat that is periodi-
cally ravaged by forest fires.
“They require patches of Open
ground rather than dense, shady
areas,” said Jones, who is study-
ing the mice at UF’s Katharine
Ordway Preserve.

Because the mice are noctur-

nal, following their movements

is a challenge.

Jones traps the mice, dusts
them with ﬂuorescent powder
and then releases them. Using a
black light, she traces their
nightly peregrinations and has
found that the little creatures
range as far as 80 feet from
their home bases.

GIVING BATS
A BETTER IMAGE

You never thought you’d love armadillos, either

t’s about time, says Aus-

tin, Texas, scientist Merlin

Tuttle, that Southerners
began appreciating their bats.
Though the South. thanks to
its abundance of caves, has
long been a favorite roosting
place for the night-ﬂying
mammals, most people have
not been willing to accept bats
with open arms in the way
they have accepted, say, the
opposum and the armadillo
(two other ungainly looking
animals that are, nonetheless,
viewed with affection by many
in the South). The reason,
Tuttle notes, is that bats have
to deal with a bad reputation
promoted by B-moviss and old
wives’ tales. Visions of vam-
pires and rumors of rabies
make it hard for many South-
erners to feel particularly
cuddly when they see some-
thing ﬂapping toward them
on leathery wings.

 

‘

But the bad reputation is,
Tuttle insists, only that, a
reputation. In truth, bats are
clean, shy, and perhaps the
best insecticide ever created:
It’s estimated that a single bat
may eat up to 600 mosquitoes
in a single evening hour.

To help promote a closer
connection between bats and
people, Tuttle founded Bat
Conservation International
(BCI), a “bats can be your bud-
dies” organization with mem-
bers in 33 countries. BCI’s
latest project has been to con-
vince home owners to replace
some of the bird houses in
their backyards with bat
houses, red cedar structures
that sell for $29.95 and look
like bird houses, except that ,
the entrance is in the bottom.
Bats can ﬂy in from below,
hook themselves to a slat of
wood, and sleep away the day
in comfort and safety.

 




BOSTON GLOBE - April 12, 1987

'. Vermonters are takin g

a look at deer farming

By Sally Johnson
Special to the Globe

_ MONTPELIER — For centuries,
; fallow deer roamed the game
parks of Europe. kept as venison
f on the hoof to satisfy the culinary
. pleasure of lords and ladies. Soon.
however, the species may find it-
_ self living in more modest circum-
' stances. browsing the former
dairy farms of Vermont.
" The concept of deer farming
has captured the interest of both
' state. officials and farmers looking
for an alternative to the ailing
dairy industry. State wildlife offi-
‘ cials already are at work rewriting
‘» regulations to allow farmers to im-
_ port fallow deer into the state.
In order for the scheme to
work, the Department of Agricul-

'- ture also would have to ask for leg-‘:

islative approval to set up a meat

inspection system like the one
-now used for beef. But Amanda
Legare. director of development
for the department. believes the
pieces can be put into place.

. ”I'm very interested. very ex—
cited about the potential of this
thing." said Legare. ”I think
there’s a market out there.” ‘

The project got a boost earlier

State deer farmer met with state
officials, legislators and interested
farmers in Montpelier and Burl-
.ington to describe the basics of
raising deer to sell for venison.
'Josef von Kerckerinck, a Ger—
-man who immigrated to the Unit-
ed States in 1978, started the
., Lucky Star Ranch in Chaumont,
N.Y.. with 50 fallow deer and
bought 300 more the next year.
Fallow deer, he told the group,
~. are ideal for farming because they
, ‘are resistant to disease. a matter
of concern to fish and wildlife offi-
~cials who have worried that new
fdeer might carry diseases that

-{ would infect the herd of white-

tailed deer that runs wild in' Ver- .

mont.

He said they are less skittish
than wild deer and can be raised
to market size for $50, enough
money to cover the cost of feed
and two annual injections. A1-

. though he sells his breeding stock

for $350 or more, he said does and
bucks are available from overpo-
pulated game parks for "consider-
ably less money.

So far, von Kerckerinck has
encountered two problems with
his herd of 1,500 deer - coyotes
and “the arrogant European chefs
at those fancy New York City res-
taurants.” The coyote problem he
solved with two strands of electric
fencing above the 75-inch fence
that pens in the deer. The chef
problem he solved more ingenious-
1y.

“I went to seven restaurants
and dumped a deer carcass on the
kitchen table in each one," he
said. “I told them if they didn’t
like the meat, they didn’t have to
pay for it. Within two weeks, I had
checks — and orders - from each
one."

Von Kerckerinck, who sold 250
deer carcasses for $300 apiece last

"this month when a New York Kyear. plans to~mail-order fresh

venison across the country this
year and believes the market po-
tential will be unlimited once diet-
conscious Americans realize that
venison “is one of the leanest
meats available." .
David Miskell, the Shelburne
vegetable grower who helped orga-
nize the meetings, said he and his
partner, a Burlington restaura-
teur, believe deer farming is an
ideal marriage of food trends and
farmland preservation efforts.
Said Miskell: “One of our con-

cerns is the effect of the loss of f
farmland on the character of Ver- f
mont. I'm happy to say we’re:
hearing a lot of enthusiasm from :
dairy farmers."

Team discovers
crossbreeding
of deer species

Associated Press

HOUSTON -— Evidence ‘of
crossbreeding between white-tailed
deer and mule deer has been dis-
covered in West Texas, researchers
say.
“Hunters and scientists have
long known that the two species
were intermingling in the Trans-
Pecos River region of Texas and
have often wondered if the in-
terbreeding could play a part in the
dwindling number of mule deer in
that part of the United States,” said
Dr. Steve Carr of Texas A&M Uni-b
versity. .

Carr led a Texas A&M research '
team that examined genetic compo-

r. sition of more than 100 deer, includ-

ing whiteiailed deer and mule deer
in West Texas.

“Surprisingly, on one Pecos
county ranch the two species were
genetically identical,” Carr said.

. “Our hypothesis is that hybridiza-

tion occurs most often between
white-tailed does and mule deer .
bucks.”

During the research, mitochond-
rial DNA from white-tailed deer in
South Carolina and mule deer from
California were also examined.

“The simplest way to look for hy-

; bridization is to find genetic differ-
ences between the species involved
and then to look at the suspected
; hybrid population for evidence of
* genes from both species,” Carr said.

"Mitochondrial DNA is inherited

solely from the mother, which

L makes it possible to determine the

’ direction of interbreeding between

species.”
Findings from the project were

recently published in an issue of
g the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, Carr said.

‘Hunters pay different prices for

leases according to the quality of

. deer available,” Carr said. “Mule
deer are often preferred because
they are larger and have larger
racks.”

“The significance of this study is
that nobody has demonstrated natu-
ral hybridization of this scale be
tween these kinds of animals," Carr
said.

DENVER POST - April 9, 1987

W ... . ._-..-.—-——..-M—.--_,.. 4.

We mustn’t lose our

. WE IN COLORADO must make a critical deci-

sion very soon: Do we want wildlife in Colo-
rado? Or do we not?
If we do, we must change the ways we think about

, all of our birds and animals. Those changes must be

dramatic, and they must start now.

First we must remember a simple geographical
fact: that Colorado, just over 104,000 square miles in
area, is as big as it’s going to be. No more land.

Then we must realize our people population will _

double by 2025. No more land; many more people.
Colorado serves its people with ever-growing quan-
tities of bricks and mortar, lumber, concrete and as-
phalt. And government. If we double our population
over the next 35 years, we surely must double our
parking lots, prisons, rock bands, highways, taxes,
fast-food stores, lawyers, colleges, hospitals and all
the rest — or else we must lower our standard of
living accordingly. What a job our kindergarten chil-
dren face! To duplicate everything we have today by
the time their lives begin at '40. .
Will they have the wit to recognize the enormous
value wildlife adds to the Colorado lifestyle? Will
they know, as we do, that wildlife already adds $1.03
billion in direct dollars to the Colorado economy each

year, and in addition provides about 20 percent of the ,

reason tourists come to Colorado and spend another
$5 billion yearly with us? Or will they take our robins
and our bighorns and our bunnies and our deer for
granted until it’s too late?

Nearly every species that can live in temperate
elevations between 3,500 and 14,300 feet lives here.

The state has set sail on a new program to bring
more jobs, industry and people to Colorado to fill vav
cant office buildings, buy more houses in the urban
sprawl and add to school, church and prison obliga-
tions. We’re paving the prairie.

The short—term problem is money. The Division of
Wildlife is charged by law to care for all our 940 spe-
cies of wildlife. The division spends about $35 million
yearly in that effort, but 98 percent of that money
comes from those who harvest Wildlife — the license
buyers. Two-thirds of that $35 million comes from the
hunter, and more than half of that two-thirds comes
from the out-of—state hunter. Less than $400,000
comes from wildlife watchers. -

As we move to town, we send our kids more and
mOre into team/ball sports. Fewer of us take them
into the woods to learn the ways of field and stream.
That means fewer hunters — and fewer dollars to the
Division of Wildlife. -

But there are solutions: many ways to keep a
space for wildlife as we prolific humans expand.

First is the land. We can, through lease, easement
or purchase, set aside more creek bottoms, arroyos,
rocky hillsides, forests. and other lands worthless for
farming or housing but perfectly remote for wildlife.

The second solution is better management of all
the land, both private and public, for wildlife. The
quiet science of wildlife maria gemeni is advancing as
rapidly as biomedics and most other more glamorous
activities of mankind. We are putting this growing
knowledge to work every day. '

The third solution-is, of course, money. Although
the people problems and the habitat problems double.

the money problem does not double; does not in—

crease by 100 percent. Only 40 percent more dollars
(but starting very soon) will let the Division of wild-
life do all it needs to do to save a space for wildlife
through 2025. That’s only $20 million more a year.

Every person in Colorado has a big stake in all our
wildlife: the robins on the lawn, the squirrels and
finches in the bird feeder, the star-eyed fawn startled
by your headlamps, the bugle of the elk across the
meadow of your camp, the white-belly flash of the
rainbow stealing your Black Gnat and doubling your
rod as he heads for the bottom.

How shall we put a wider base under this precious
wildlife resource? Once gone, we can never bring it
back. If we could lift just one more dollar from each
of the 23 million tourists who visit us each year (part-
ly to watch wildlife), we’d be home free. The average
tourist spends more than $200 a day while he’s in C01.
orado. How much would another dollar worry him?

More and more people in Colorado are realizing
that wildlife are the property of every citizen. That‘s
why, maybe, all of us ought to help the license buyer
pay for the upkeep of our herds, flocks and coveys.

Last year, the governor named a score of success-
ful executives not involved in wildlife to an Executive
Task Force on the Future of Wildlife. That unbiased
group will soon report to the governor, the legislature

. and the people on what. they suggest to save a space

for wildlife over the next generation.

One recommendation might put a small excise tax
on collateral gear that wildlife watchers use in the
outdoors: hiking boots and clothing, tents and other
camping equipment, birdseed, camper vehicles, bin-
oculars, maybe even Skiing gear, and certainly off-
road vehicles that severely damage wildlife habitat.
There is noble precedent for such an idea. For many
years, the Dingell-Johnson (by former Colorado Sen.

‘ Edwin C. Johnson) and Pittman-Robertson laws have

provided just such a levy at the federal level with
high success. Colorado shares more than $3 million of
these federal proceeds yearly, again all provided
painlessly by the license buyer.
. I personally believe collateral users, viewers and
photographers of wildlife would say a loud “yes” to
such an excise levy. What’s 1 percent of the cost of a
$100 tent if it brings a curious raccoon into camp?
We need wildlife. We can have wildlife if we want
it. And if we do, it‘s up to all of us to tell one another
—— and our legislators —- that a Space for wildlife is
worth a few dimes a year from each of us who so
deeply enjoy the beautiful animals, birds and fishes
that help to make our lives delightful.

The last known condor outside captivity

The last flight? ~

THE CALIFORNIA condor is all but
extinct. Fewer than 30 condors remain.

In an effort to save these endangered
members of the vulture family that once
soared above the rough terrain of the
American West, wildlife experts this
week captured the last known condor
living outside captivity. The ideals to
breed the scavengers with the intention of,
releasing the species into the wild again ,
someday.

The intention is good, but the plan
seems futile. Wildlife experts must look
beyond the condor’s declining numbers
and at the cause of the great bird’s demise:
humans. Pesticides killed the young. Peo-
ple encroached on the open spaces that
North America’s largest bird called its
own for centuries; the terrain that was the
condor’s niche has become popular with

. hikers, vacationers and developers.

In captivity, the condor will never be
anything more than a caged animal at
which humans willgawk. It is a bleak
picture for the huge though graceful bird.
But it is a bleaker picture for humans, who
are trying to save the condor but who are
also responsible for its near extinction.

‘% ‘Patenting of ‘Invented’ Animals OKd " 2
US. to Begin Accepting Applications on Laboratory Life Forms

By ROBERT A. JONES, Times Staff, Writer

-»4~ ‘

ginonths ago we saw technology

‘The federal government, in a
dramatic reversal of policy, an-
nounced Friday that it will consid-
er applications for patents on new
types of animals developed through
genetic manipulation.

Once‘ instituted, the new policy
would allow inventors to own the
exclusive right to create animals
they have developed, such as cows
that produce more milk or pigs that
are resistant to certain diseases.
Previously, the government limit-
ed such patents to microorganisms
and plants. .

The decision by the Commerce
Department’s Patent and Trade-
mark Office raises a host of moral
and scientific questions. No other
country currently grants such pat-
ents, and several groups, including _
the Humane Society, say they will
mount a campaign to have the new
policy rescinded.

“It is not an overstatement to say
that the decision to patent animals
could signify the end of the natural
world,” Fox said.

The policy includes all forms of
higher life with the exception of
humans. In Washington, patent
officials said the agency regards
the patenting of human life as
prohibited by the Constitution.

However, Donald J. Quigg, as-
sistant secretary of commerce and
commissioner of patents and trade-
marks, said the decision would
allow human genes to be used in
genetic alterations of other animal
types. In such an arrangement, a

. desirable human gene—resistant to
:a disease, for example—would be
gjisolated and then spliced onto the
f:genetic makeup of another animal
3 such as a. chicken. The result would

be an otherwise normal-looking
chicken that is resistant to the
same disease as people. 3

Quigg said such experimentation
might also lead to medical break-
throughs for humans. “Not many

‘ used to produce red blood cells '

from white blood cells in the fight
against cancer. All you have to do
j is solve a couple of health problems
i like AIDS or cancer and it [genetic
research] could be worth the mon-
ey."

The reversal of policy came after
an appellate board of the patent
office ruled on April 3 that an
extra-large form of oyster pro-
duced by a Seattle firm could be
considered for a patent. The board
held that the oyster fell under a
1980 Supreme Court ruling declar-
ing that Congress intended patents
to cover “anything under the sun
that is made by man.” Though

' instigating the change, the oyster
application eventually was turned
down because the patent office
found the process was not suffi-
ciently original.

15 Pending Applications

At present, patent officials said,
there are 15 applications for animal
patents pending before the agency.
They estimated that some of the
applications could be approved

3 within the next 18 months. The
patent agency has even assigned a
new category for the patents: Class
BOO-Multicellular Living Organ-
isfms and Unmodified Parts There-
0 .

The new decision will not affect
the patent office’s longstanding
policy of refusing to patent any-
thing that can be found in the
natural world. According to the
officials, only those creatures that
have been invented by man will be
considered for patents under the
new policy.

Supporters of the technology say
that genetic engineering is a meth-
od of developing superior livestock

. more quickly and efficiently than

the current technique of selective
breeding. Once genes are isolated,
they can improve breeds in one
generation, scientists say; selective
breeding usually takes many gen-
erations to produce results.

Gene Splicing

According to Dr. Bennie Osburn,
professor of veterinary pathology
at UC Davis, gene splicing is highly
specific and will also allow breed- .
ers to avoid the defects that some-
times are produced, along with '

desirable traits, through selective j
breeding. . l

~~w-_.....

Thus far, such efforts have pro-
' duced only modest results. At UC
Davis scientists combined a goat
tembryo and a sheep embryo 18
f months ago to produce a creature
known as a “geep.” At the Univer-
sity of Maryland a faster-growing
pig has been produced with mixed
results; the pig has the same type of
5 defects associated with Selective
E, breeding techniques. .
3 Osburn estimated that a decade
3 may pass before any dramatic
;- progress is made with genetic ma-
3 nipulation of animals. At present,
he said, only a few basic genes,
such as a bovine growth gene, have
been isolated. No genes relating to
i disease resistance have been iso-
lated, he said. Most university
research on biological engineering
is now being carried out at three
institutions: UC Davis, the Univer-
: sity of Wisconsin and the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania. -
The predictions of leaner pigs
and more productive chickens has

A I not assuaged they oppon'ents'Of the 3

new policy. On Friday a coalition of
groups vowed to take their case to '
Congress, where they will ask for
legislation to rescind the decision.

“In one regulatory stroke, the
US. Patent Office has moved the
US. society into the ‘brave new
world’ that Aldous Huxley warned
of many years ago,” Jeremy Rifkin,
president of the Foundation on
Economic Trends and a longtime
critic of genetic engineering, said in

T a prepared statement. “We have a
3 policy that could allow corpora-
l. tions to monopolize the genetic
code of all forms of animals. This
policy is unconscionable and mor-
%, ally repugnant.”

l

l At the Humane Society; Fox
K disputed the theory that gene
splicing would avoid the defects of
selective breeding. He predicted
that entire generations of new
animals would suffer from crip-
pling and agonizing defects such as
susceptibility to diseases, bone dis-
f , orders, and so forth.

Fox also predicted that the policy
opens the door to human engineer-
ing, no matter what the patent
office says. “The same promises of
improved this and improved that
will lead, inevitably, to tinkering
with the human being," he said.

Gwinnett couple
to go to prison
fOr‘ puppy mill’

 

’8)! Sheryl Roehl
Staff Writer

 

In what a prosecutor described
as the worst animal cruelty case
Gwinnett County has seen, a Superi-

or Court judge sentenced a Lawren- '

ceville couple to prison terms and
lifetime probation Wednesday for
Operating a “puppy mill” at their
home.

Bobette Marie Phillips, 50, of
1361 Cherokee Trail was sentenced
to three years in prison and life on
probation for 111 counts of cruelty
to animals; Operating as an unli-
censed pet dealer and kennel; and
felony obstruction of a police officer
in connection with a December raid
on her house.

Her husband, Dale Francis Phil-

lips, 51, was sentenced to two years
in prison with lifetime probation.

The Phillipses, who said they '

pleaded guilty only to avoid a pro-
longed trial, continued to insist they
were innocent and “love dogs.”

The two also were ordered to
pay $16,505 each to cover the costs
of feeding, boarding and medically
treating the dogs seized in the Dec.
5 raid on their home.

“I believe this is the worst ani-
mal cruelty case to hit the country
or the county, in talking with Hu-
mane Society and AKC [American
Kennel Club] peOple,” said Phyllis
Miller, the Gwinnett assistant dis-
trict attorney who proSecuted the
case.

“It is the first one to come
‘ through the court system to be ad-
dressed in this magnitude,” she said,
referring to the penalties.

When police searched the Phil-

MAM-..” .r,

lipses’ house in December, they
found dogs confined two apiece in
travel carriers inside the couple’s
garage. Other dogs, including pure-
bred poodles, schnauzers and dachs-
hunds, were locked in groups of 10
in pens in a storage barn in the
back yard.

. In the raid, 109 dogs were load-
ed into five trucks and taken to the

county animal control shelter. Since
then, 15 adult dogs and 19 puppies,

have died, according to Mrs. Miller.

The couple Operated a profit-
making puppy mill out of their
Lawrenceville home that appeared
to be their only means of financial
support, according to Mrs. Miller.
Evidence in the trial showed that
the Phillipses sold hundreds of pure-
bred dogs such as schnauzers and
poodles for $200 to $1,000 apiece.

In the barn behind their home,
the couple bred older dogs, which
often lived in filthy conditions with-
out food, water or veterinary care,
according to evidence.

The couple’s undercover breed-
ing farm operated under the name
“Bobette’s Kennel.” Mrs. Miller said
that when buyers came to the cou-
ple’s house, the Phillipses would
bring out a cute puppy and usually
refuse to show the offspring’s par-
ents. Born to aged, sick, often
mange- and disease-ridden parents,
the puppies often would die within a
few days, Mrs. Miller said.

“Some peOple sit back and say
that they’ re just dogs,” she said.
“But they’ re living, breathing, feel-
ing creatures, and for someone to
let them suffer intentionally, to
choose to treat them like this is just
beyond words.

respect all life.”

A vegetarian since she was
10, Jennifer challenged the
school system three years ago
for the same reason.

“They let me do an alterna-

think I got the hands-on experi-
ence, so my grade was a little
lower,” she says, adding she’s

We need vicious dog law
with serious deterrence

Dr. William G. Eckman, the 67-year-old vic-
tim of two pit bull dogs Monday, was an im-
posing target.

He stood 5ofoot-10 and," according to the
Montgomery County coroner’s office, weighed
270 pounds. Like all too many of us, he could
not be described as agile or athletic.

Once the two pit bulls at 256 Marathon Ave-
nue went after him, in front of Joetta Darm-
stadter, a resident at that address, he was pow-
erless to fend them off. For 10 to 15 minutes he
was viciously attacked even as onlookers ig-
nored the obvious risks and tried to beat or.
scare the dogs off.‘

The would- be rescuers found you don’t de- '

ter pit bulls by hitting them with broomsticks
or curtain rods or by honking horns or slam-
ming pipes against the street.

You need something far more substantial -— .

like baseball bats, tire irons, crowbars or
sledge hammers.

Trainers are a major factor ,

Pit bull dogs, we know from many such
tragedies, are trained to attack. The better
their owners are at training them as merciless
fighters, the meaner they become. They have
such tremendous jaw pressure that once they
get a grip on a victim’s arm or leg, they can
crush the bone. They also go for the jugular.

They may weigh only 30 to 50 pounds, but _
they are fearless. They attack on command or .
when “something” provokes them, a Mont-=7.

"simmers, “111;;- ‘Bthe'r " aims; they‘ne
5:. seemingly oblivious to pain.

For the late Dr. Eckman, it’s hard to imagine
a more terrifying way to die. The dogs at-
tacked his arms and his legs and ripped them.
They went after him much as a pack of wolves:

will isolate and kill a stray deer.

Eckman is said to have eventually died of a

I heart attack, but the odds are that the damage

the dogs did him would have caused his death.

' Dr. James Davis, Montgomery County coro-
ner, said the dogs tore “large, gaping
wounds. . . all the way down to the bone” in
both of Eckman’s legs and in his right arm.

When asked if the wounds wanid have prov-
en fatal, Davis said, “I would say, ‘yes.’ ”

The attack on Dr. Eckman, unfortunately, is
not an isolated incident.

Thetoll in 1986: 13

Two other Americans have died in pit bull
dog attacks this year -- one an elderly Cleve-
lander, the other a baby in Oklahoma, coinci-
dentally last Monday, the day Eckman died.

State Rep. Robert Hickey, proponent of a
vicious dog bill now before an Ohio House

, The toll in 1985, he says, was five -— three ‘
of them involving pit bulls. In 1984 it was 3'
three, all involving pit bulls. :1

' Hickey has been gathering material for his .

legislation for well over a year. It appears to be .

 
 

I
.34

  

‘a sound one because it addresses all dogs that
are vicious, not just one breed.

There is little sense in targeting pit bull dogs
alone —— not because their owners’ constitu-
tional rights might be affected but because
they aren’t the only dogs that menace our
neighborhoods and attack our citizens.

If our legislators limit legislation to a single
breed, they would exempt other breeds —-
most notably, German shepherds and Dober-

1 man pinschers -— and that could be a mistake.

We should remember the Daytonian who

. appeared before city commissioners Wednes-
day and told them about the damage a German
shepherd did to his 6-year-old granddaughter.
She required a thousand stitches, he said. .

Hickey’s proposed legislation has one appar-
ent flaw: its maximum penalties would be a
$1,000 fine, a six-month sentence and the pos-
sible destruction -— depending on the court --
of the offending dog.

. Why not severe penalties?

When one considers the dangers that vicious

dogs pose, particularly to children in residen-
’ tial areas, these are mild deterrents. They are
insufficient and therefore unacCeptable.

State Sen. Neal Zimmers, on the other hand,
would like to see tougher penalties — but he is
inclined to target pit bulldogs and no others.

The two Democrats should team up and
broaden their scope, and Dayton’s commis-
sioners should support them in this effort rath-
er than expend their energy on another ordi-
nance with wrist-slapping penalties.

. Meanwhile, Montgomery County Prosecu-
tor Lee Falke says he is still trying to gather

; the facts in Eckman’s death and see what
charges, if any, can be preferred under exist-
! ing law. He is also examining other state laws
in dog-caused deaths, he says. .

It is appalling to think that charges may not
be filed in Eckman’s death because the initial
attack may have begun on the property at 256
Marathon -- and the city’s ordinance, passed
in 1984, primarily addresses attacks “off the

. premises of the owner.”

If Falke can’t prosecute, his action -— his
inaction, rather —— will demonstrate afresh our
need for state-wide legislation to protect all
Ohioans, young and old.

We do not need another horrifying death
like Dr. Eckman’s to make the point.

Paramount Pictures. "Star Trek IV” also '
garnered four Academy Award
nominations, including cinematography,
original score, sound and sound effects

Translating the movie’s gross into
number of viewers is difficult with
variables such as discount tickets and
complimentary passes, according to
Paramount officials.

Greenpeace, though, heard from some '
of those moviegoers soon after the film
hit the screen. -

The Washington, D.C., office, one of ,
six regional offices nationwide, noticed a
marked increase in phone calls and
3 letters, with schoolchildren requesting
information for assignments and '
members of the general public
wondering whether whaling was still
going on.

Russ Wild, assistant media director,
seem otanpreamately 75 neopie who

saw the movie and wrote to the .
organization immediately after the film’s
release, 60 included donations. The
receptionist at the chapter’s office .
fielded about 25 calls a day, Wild said. 3
However, the organization did not keep , ,
an official count of the calls and letters, .
Wilkinson said. And although donations
increased, Greenpeace is unsure whether
“a membership drive or the mov1e lS
responsible. -

“All of the elements . . . subtly .
reinforce why Greenpeace exists,” said

 

 

Wilkinson. ~ ,
Greenpeace officials contend that the

movie has some factual errors. For
example, the minke whale, not the

 

humpback whale, is the target of .
commercial Whalers from the Sov1et

Korea. ‘
“The humpback is no longer being
hunted to the point of being . .

commercially extinct,” Willnnsonsaid.
But the National Marine Fisheries

 

-.._<—_. .- -'-—

Service has classified the humpback as

, endangered, with only 10,000 remaining "
from the approximately 120,000 that once
existed. i

The movie also showed a Finnish .
whaling crew hunting the ocean-dwelling ._
mammals. Finland, however, has
honored the full moratorium on
commercial whaling that was passed by
the International Whaling Commission in ‘
1982, Wilkinson said.

“If this had been a Jacques Cousteau _
documentary, it would be unforgivable,” ’
said Peter Dykstra, media director for '
the local chapter. “For the frame of
reference that is Hollywood . . . the
message is right on the money.” -

Greenpeace, which began in 1971 as the
12-member Don’t Make A Wave ’
Committee in Vancouver, British
Columbia, has national organizations in ,3
17 countries and 1.5 million members
worldwide.

Employing mostly young, idealistic
volunteers, the group campaigns on a

range of environmental and anti-war
issues, With an emphasis on wildlife
protection, toxic-waste disposal and
nuclear weapons. .

The group is known for sending out
volunteers in rubber boats in the path of

whaling harpooners — a fact notlost on

Nimoy and William Shatner, who plays
Kirk, and who both are active
contributors to Greenpeace.

“There’s a homage to Greenpeace in ‘

the movie because the idea of putting the
spaceship between the whaling ship and
the whales and being hit by the harpoon
has Greenpeace roots,” Nimoy said in a
published interview in November.
“Greenpeace used to go out in rubber
rafts in front of the Russian ships to try
to prevent them from firing their
harpoons, and that’s where that idea
came from. ‘ , ,
“But I did not set out to make a cause

' film,” he said. “It’s a piece of

entertainment in which there are some
ideas.”

TAMPA TRIBUNE - April 27, 1987

Panther program " ,
pushes preservation

By JEFF HERMAN
Tribune Staff Writer

TOWN ’N COUNTRY - A cous-
in of the endangered Florida pan-
. ther delighted children Sunday at
Upper Tampa Bay Park, as the big
cat’s owner urged the crowd to sup-
port wildlife preservation efforts.
Mackenzie Ott, 9, met nearly
eye-to—eye with the tawny brown-
colored panther before retreating
behind a picnic bench near Mom.
Mackenzie’s mother, Peggy Ott, 38,
said after petting the panther’s
back, “I just want to give him a big
hug."

It was the second time the Otts’
had seen the Florida panther and
its caretaker, Bert Wahl, president
of Wildlife Rescue, a non-profit
group that helps homeless, sick and
injured wildlife.

Wahl told about 90 people gath-
ered at the pavilion for a wildlife
education lecture that his panther
shares a bloodline with the endan-
gered Florida panther. He said sci-
entists have been able to find only
30 Florida panthers, though they
suspect there may be more in the
wild, mainly near the Everglades.

Florida panthers are reclusive

and are thought to be less a danger
to man than man is to the survival
of the panther population, he said.
“We don’t have a lot of time for
the Florida panther,” Wahl said.
More of the animals are killed by
cars than are bred each year, he
said. ‘ '
The Florida panther has been
protected by law since 1958,- and
state conservation officers have be-
gun a breeding program. But Wahl
called captive breeding "a last-ditch
effort,” and said providing an ap-
propriate safe habitat for the pan-
thers to breed in the wild may be
better. -
But, he said, that takes public
support to push legislators to ear4
mark money to preserve the Flori-
da panther. He urged adults and -
parents in the audience to write
their legislators to voice their sup-
port for panther preservation ef-
forts and to be better consumers at
the grocery store.- ‘
As an example, Wahl advised
buying only detergents without
phosphates, which can pollute water
resources. The informed consumer
protects wildlife resources, he said. 3
“Every single one of us can 3‘
make a difference,” he said.

alien space probe, they also focused
attention on Greenpeace's efforts to stop
commercial whaling.

Is it logical to hunt a species to
extinction? the half-Vulcan, half-human
Mr. Spock asks in “Star Trek IV: The
Voyage Home,” as he and other
members of the Enterprise crew go back
in time to retrieve two humpback whales
to neutralize the probe.

The Greenpeace organization, which
for 15 years has fought to save the
whales, heartily agrees with Mr. Spock,
who in real life is actordirector Leonard
Nimoy, and is grateful to him for the
movie’s focus. .

“It’s brought attention to the fact that
whaling is still going on,” says Gene
Wilkinson, wildlife legislative director at
Greenpeace’s Washington chapter. “The
whale population is vulnerable to the

point of extinction.
' “Also it stands for a whole lot of ‘

. species that countries are exploiting or
losing due to extinction,” Wilkinson said.
“Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home”

portrays the humpback whale as being
extinct since the 21st century. The alien
space probe, which is draining power
from the 23rd century Earth, emits
sounds the crew eventually determines to
. be that of the whale.

The crew jets back to 1986 to capture
two humpback whales, transport them to
the future and save Earth.

feeding habits. One by one, the biolo-
gists began rounding them up. Men hid
in pits beside the carcasses of calves
and goats, waiting for hours for con-
dors to alight, then grabbing their legs
or ﬁring cannon nets over them.
Finally they were down to AC-9——-

the ninth adult condor tagged. _A.

strange bird, nicknamed Ivan, he
seemed to tease his pursuers, eluding
their traps, sometimes swooping down
for a look at bird watchers in the open
and once watching from a perch in a
tree while another condor, AC-5, Was
caught. He almost got away when
Bloom triggered the net. “A quarter
second later and he would have been
gone. They move very fast.”

A family grouping

Now Ivan is conﬁned with 13 other
condors at San Diego. His world is a
ﬂight cage 80 feet long with sun porch-'
es, bathing pools and an expansive view
of the San Pasqual Valley. Maintaining
the condors costs up to $200,000 a year.
Human contact is kept to a minimum so
the birds don’t become domesticated.
Experts insist that breeding will not be a
problem and has never succeeded in
artiﬁcial surroundings only because un-
til last year compatible adult pairs had
never been in captivity. Ivan’s mate is
there, along with one of the pair’s male
oifspring. A newly mature male has
been ﬂirting with another older female
condor. Toone believes their courtship
will produce a chick in 1988.

If all these efforts fail, what then? If
humans, in self-appointed roles as care-
takers of the earth, don’t save the con-
dors, where to draw the line? Who then
will care about the common loon, the
Puerto Rican parrot, the gray bat, the
black-footed ferret or ﬁsh such as the
chub and the dace that are also in dead-
ly decline? And what of the Chumash
Indian tribe, who call the condor X01
X0], or God, and believe their spirits
are carried to heaven on its wings?

“The condor,” explains Alexander
Sprunt of the National Audubon Soci-
ety, “is a good example of a species that
is an indicator of the wilderness. It’s
like, if you are driving a car down the
road and you throw away a wheel
lug—it won’t make a difference. But if
you keep throwing away the wheel
lugs, you will make a difference.” ’

And so the condor passes—at least
from the open skies. Perhaps its ab-
sence will be temporary, just a blip in
its venerable history. Perhaps it will
never ﬂy free again. Either way, let

history also note that mankind thought

it mattered. I

Trying to save the animals

 

The bottom line in the global battle to save
creatures from extinction is to prevent loss of
habitat. The Endangered Species Act is sup-
posed to do this in the United States, though
pollution and development still threaten 450
different species in this country. Some other
countries are equaling, if not surpassing, U.S.
efforts. Australia is proposing a bill that would
permit the stoppage of all development that
threatens the survival of a species. Economically
troubled Costa Rica sets aside nearly 10 percent
of its land for national parks and preserves.

U.S., arguments still rage over this issue.

Many rare species exist in developing
countries, where feeding growing human
populations takes priority. Yet 16 Afri-
can nations Spend $45 million running
parks and preserves to save wildlife. The
black rhino, the horns of which make it a
target for poachers, is protected around
the clock in Zambia by commandos with

orders to shoot to kill.

Bruce Wilcox of the Center for Conservation
Biology at Stanford University sees altruistic
motivations in many who work to save endan-
gered species. But, he says, “in the end, the
conservationists always meet head-on with the
economists.” What has saved gorillas and chee-
tahs in Africa, says Wilcox, is the prospect of
$500 million a year from safari-bound tourists.

In the United States, there are recovery
plans for 450 endangered species, but half of
the projects are still only on paper. “It’s like
having a medical prescription without pur-
chasing the medicine,” says Michael Bean of
the Environmental Defense Fund.

The consequence may be seen in what
happened to the dusky seaside sparrow.
With its Florida habitat ravaged by de-
velopers in the 19605, the dusky’s num-
bers dwindled from thousands to a hand-
ful by 1983. Now, there is only one
dusky still alive. At age 9 or 10, about
100 years in human terms, he sits on a
perch in a cage at Walt Disney World,
awaiting extinction.

Caged: The last wild condor

I And so, for the ﬁrst time in 600,000
years, the skies are clear of the Califor-
nia condor. The last one to soar in the
wild now roosts in a zoo.

Let history record that the freedom
of this Ice Age relic ended at 10:15 am.
(PDT) on Easter Sunday, April 19,
1987, when a biologist named Pete
Bloom, hiding in a hole in the ground,
ﬁred a cannon net over the creature as
it took a bite out of a dead goat.

Man had to put the bird in a cage, the
experts decreed, to save it from the
world. Today there are only 27 living
condors—divided between the Los An-
geles Zoo and the San Diego Wild Ani-
mal Park. They are not on display. All
are part of a controversial and costly
experiment with the noble intent of in-
creasing their numbers so they can be
released back into the wilderness at
some later time with a greater chance for
survival of the species. Yet to date, not
one California condor has ever been
bred in captivity. There is a chance that,
free or not, within the next 20 or 40 years
or so (nobody knows exactly how long
they live), the condor will be extinct.

Does it matter? Zoologically speak-
ing, not much. Condors evolved scav-
enging on carcasses left by the vast
herds of gigantic animals that roamed
the western half of North America in
the Pleistocene epoch. We’re talking
woolly mammoths here. The last time a
condor spied one of those morsels and
cleaned up the tablelands was 10,000 or
15,000 years ago. Lately, they’ve gotten

by on tidbits—dead sheep and cattle in
the rough country outside Los Angeles.
But there are plenty of golden eagles
and'common vultures to take care of
those scraps. Nature, it seems, can do
without the condor.

The question is, can people? The im-
portance of the condor is not what it
means to nature but what it represents
to civilization. “The condor is a biolog-
ical indicator telling us that something
is going wrong with our environment,”

Ivan, condor AC-9: He teased his
pursuers and bedeviled bird
watchers—and he almost got away

says Bill Toone, bird curator at the San
Diego Wild Animal Park. “The condor
is a ﬂagship.”

It also is one of the most magniﬁcent
of all living things. True, it is only an
overgrown buzzard of a sort, with a bald,
wrinkled head and a taste for rotten
meat. A clumsy thing, its landings are
crashes and its takeol’fs are lumbering.
Ah, but airborne! The largest ﬂying bird
on the continent, it soars on wings that
span 9 feet. With one ﬂap, it can travel 10
miles, coasting on thermals. In a day it
can cover 150 miles at speeds up to 80
miles an hour. It is likely that the last
thing the last, dying saber-toothed tiger
saw was a condor. Skeletons of both,
dating from that time, have been dug out
of the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles.
Condors are a living link to prehistory.
Multiple hazards

Before the winter of 1984-85, an av-
erage of two condors a year had been
dying from pesticides, collisions with
high-tension wires, lead poisoning from
game left by hunters or even man’s
bullets. But that winter six birds disap-
peared without a trace. The wild popu-
lation was down to 15, with only one
pair nesting. Afraid the genetic pool
was too small for those still free to
revive, the US. Fish and Wildlife Ser-
vice demanded that all be captured.

The story of the hunt is one of tech-
nology against nature. Since 1979, nine
birds had been ﬁtted with 2-ounce ra-
dio transmitters and tracked by Jeep
and small plane to map their range and

L]? Wlb Pixie N, '

RIXIE IS NOT THE FIRST

dog I had after I became an

adult, or even the second I

got the first one alrnost 15

years ago, and named her

Mary. She was a gray-

furred, blue-eyed Weima-

raner. She fell asleep by

sucking my thumb until she

nodded off. From the day my

girlfriend and I carried her from San Francisco to
Santa Cruz in a napkin, Mary lived with me — for
10 years. The girlfriend came and went. Mary
stayed. “A man and his dog” is more than a phrase.
Mary and I were together in a tiny apartment
in Santa Cruz, in a small house in Georgetown, in
a penthouse in Brooklyn Heights, in an apart~
ment on the Sunset Strip, in a rambling chateau
in Aspen, in a tumbledown apartment in Malibu,
and mostly in a funky split-level in Hollywood.

When I got Mary, I was a teacher and a hippie.
Subsequently, I became a trial lawyer, a White
House speechwriter, a columnist, a sitcom writer,
a Hollywood tourist of 10 years’ duration, unmar-
ried, married and respectable. Everything in my
life changed, except Mary’s perfect sensitivity, loy-
alty, and her sucking my thumb to fall asleep.

 

Ian J. Shah, a lawyer and a writer, lives in Los Angeles.

.-

 

Mary died on April 20, 1982, after a long strug-
gle with cancer. Eight years before, she had skit-
tered down the marble hallways of the White
House to see me when I worked on the Watergate
defense team. On her last day, she skittered
along a veterinarian's ceramic tile floor into my
arms and then into eternity.

‘ It was by far the worst day of my life. To ward
off our grief, my wife and I got another Weima-
raner from an animal orphanage. We named this
one Martha. She is a fine animal, but she’s from
outer space: Her tail grows measurably longer
depending on the phases of the moon, and then
shorter again. She can open locked filing cabi-
nets. She repeatedly chewed up the inside of my
car, released the parking brake and sent it
crashing into a neighbor’s Saab. A dog psycholo-
gist (I told you I live in LA.) suggested we get
her a dog companion.

Two weeks later, we went to the animal or-
phanage again and picked up quite simply the
most beautiful animal I have ever seen. She was
a perfectly spotted brown and white German
short-haired pointer. Her fur was ermine. Her
snout was long and aristocratically straight. Her
eyes were limpid brown pools. Her tail had a tiny
tuft at the end. When she entered our house, her

body shook, as if she were
trying to wag her whole self
to please us. '

Her previous owner had
been a surgeon in Encino
who had given her away be-
cause his wife objected to
her for reasons not then
known. He had called her Tif-
fany, which is fine for a call
girl, but not right for the In-
grid Bergman of dogs. We
called her Trixie, at my
wife’s suggestion. .

In the beginning, she slept
next to the bed When I would
awake to another hazy day,
Trixie would give me a look
that I have seen in movies
but never in real life. The
look said: “I am warm. I am
innocent. I am giving. Do
with me what you will.” I
took the cue, picked her up
and hugged her.

A few words on what it feels
like to hold Trixie. An Angel of
the Lord has visited you and
told you that you will live for-

ever, and that every day will
be a spring day in Nassau,
with warm, balmy breezes at
twilight You are in the invin-
cible center of the universe.
Nothing can ever harm you
Your life transcends fear,
struggle, loss, mortality. That
isthefeel of Trixie.

From the start, Trixie was my girl. She fol-
lowed me from room to room, lay on a ratty
couch and watched me write, snored by my side
while I read, would not even take food if she could
stay by my side instead, which is the ultimate dog
test — and maybe the ultimate person test as well.

Trixie would watch television with me in the
guest room, then cry when I left to get into bed
with my wife. She did not want to share. She
wagged her whole self, yawned, made as if it
were the most natural thing in the world for us to
continue to watch television together.

The allure often succeeded. The slightest snore
of my wife, even her falling asleep soundly so
that she did not notice, would send me back to the
guest room and the television set. Trixie was al-
ways waiting for me with smoky eyes and wag-
ging taiL g ‘

Trixie did not like to be left alone. About six
months after I got her, I had to stay up in Santa
Cruz after a weekend there with my wife. When
my wife came home without me, Trixie started
to growl. Then she hit Martha, the Weimaraner.
My wife did the forbidden. She got into a dogfight.
In an instant, Trixie hit my wife’s wrist severely.
Our housekeeper’s knee was gnawed to the carti-
lage. When I got home, my wife was in Cedars-
Sinai on intravenous antibiotics. The house-
keeper was in bed at her daughter’s home in Pas-
adena. Martha was at the vet’s, under observa-
tion Trixie was in the guest bedroom wagging
her tall.

I offered to shoot Trixie ritually in the back-
yard. My vision was of Garbo as Mata Hari, ex-
haling a final puff as she faced the firing squad.
(Needless to say, I could never have done it) But
my wife is a saint, the housekeeper is a saint, and
Martha is from another planet, so they all for-
gave Trixie, and she escaped retribution.

Now time has passed Children look at me and
say, “Look at that old man (I am 42) with that
beautiful dog.” But Trixie has stayed as young
and perfect as when she first wagged her way
into our lives. '

My wife has become a high party official in
Hollywood She takes breakfast meetings at the
Polo Lounge. She leaves the house before I do.
Then, each morning, I hear a rustling and a snuf-
fling, feel a warm, furry Trixie chest and little
insistent paws. Trixie gives me a warm lick on
my nose. ,

For a few minutes, I do not think about how
much richer Michael Eisner is than I am, why
my scripts never get made, why we live in a
funky shack while everyone we know lives in
Brentwood Park, or why ’I have to get older. I
don’t think about anything.

I only feel Trixie’s warmth and her yielding,
furry, loyal, giving, jealous self and see myself in
her enormous brown eyes. Dogs know nothing of
mortality. She sees me and knows that I will be
there forever, and she will be forever in my
arms. For a few minutes every morning, and
sometimes late at night, I know it, too. I

  




 

. skills may be pretty much a complete
. behavioral structure, something like

i’ a completed house that needs only
the finishing touches—paint and
furnishings—in order to be lived in.

From studies in the wild, we now
know that social interaction is the center
of gorilla life; just being among others
is security and comfort in times of stress.
Therefore, isolating pregnant females
amounts to solitary confinement. It
seems to have been the loneliness and
frustration resulting from the social
deprivation that perverted the maternal
instinct.

So now, three young gorillas—Cleo,
Evie and Sandy— are approaching the
finish line of pregnancy at the Los Angeles
Zoo. Cleo isdue this month, Evie in
July and Sandy in August. For the first
time in the 200’s history, the gorilla
mothers will be allowed to give birth
by themselves and encouraged to rear
their infants naturally, among the other
gorillas. Encouraged is the proper
word. If the young mothers need
instruction—if, say, they’re holding
a baby upside down or if they leave
one lying on the ground—then two

keepers, Bob Wolf and Jennifer Chatﬁeld,

will act as teachers. The two have raised
Cleo, Evie and Sandy from late infancy
and are on such remarkably intimate
terms with them that the gorillas will
allow them to take any upside-down
infants and demonstrate proper
baby-holding tactics. If an infant is left
lying, the keepers will pick it up and
present it back to the responsible party.

Hopes are running high for this project. .

And it all goes back to Dianne’s having
shown the right stuff. But the obvious
conclusion, a provocative one, is that
motherhood in gorillas has to have

a deep, innate basis; that the mothering
impulse and the basic skills must be
stored in some hidden, primal program.
If Dianne had been a canary, a gopher

or even a hippopotamus, the
implications would not be so suggestive.
You expect “instinct” to lead a

dumb, unreasoning beast. But Dianne
cannot be dismissed so easily. Her
intelligence is unquestioned. She is

our close relative. To see Dianne
demonstrate the same tenderness of

a human mother—all Without benefit

of a normal upbringing, the presence

of experienced females or Lamaze
training—has got to burn very close

to the sacred beliefs of many. It driVes
creationists and some psychologists

to fury. I think that’s because they sense
that to accept the innate in the ape
threatens the illusion of reason and

free will in the human; it takes away

the license of self-proclaimed superiority,
and lets us loose together—man and
beast—naked, in the same natural world.

LOS ANGELES TIMES Magazine - April 19, 1987

A Mother of Invention

The Los Angeles Zoo Is About to

Challenge the Idea That Zoo-Born Gorillas Make Bad Parents

 

0 one knows precisely
what happened
that afternoon, but
it must have gone something
like this: Dianne had been
tending her baby, as would
any mother with an infant
born just three days earlier.
At times she cradled him
in her massive, hairy arms
and gazed at his wrinkled
face. Sometimes she sat
and held her baby close
to her chest. When she moved
about, she took him in the
crook of her arm and walked
carefully, supporting herself
on one arm and two legs.
It had been an intense three
days in the life of a mother
who had lost another infant
to stillbirth, and except
for the fact that she was
separated from her friends
and relatives, it had been a good time.
Now, however, it was the afternoon
of the Fourth ofJuly. The humans had
started arriving early in the hills of Griffith
Park, and the various yelps, laughs and
shrieks of picnicking families were
punctuated with the sporadic patter
of ﬁrecrackers. Then, probably sparked
by stray fireworks, the grass ignited
and ﬂames raced over the hillside. Smoke
billowed into the sky and settled over
the compound where Dianne was kept
separated from the other gorillas. There
is nothing so disturbing to any animal
as smoke, and it must have been terrifying
to the gorilla, a species that has very
few offspring and compensates by forming
a strong bond with them and investing
years of care. But worst of all, she was
isolated. She could hear the other
gorillas; they were just beyond the wall.
But she could not touch them—could
not draw comfort from a glance or a
grunt from Chris, the big, protective
male. Almost certainly, the hidden
programs of survival came on line, and

 

 

 

Dianne must have stridden back and
forth along the walls, scanning the top
for some handhold, some way to climb
out and save her infant. But there was
no way out.

. Suddenly, a gigantic shape appeared
overhead, blotting out the sky with
its enormous wings, emitting a deafening
roar. At tree level it ﬂew, looming
over her, a split-second later
disappearing—a borate bomber ﬂying
in to douse the fire.

There is no doubt that Dianne
panicked. In her arms was her infant, her
genes, packaged in this tiny piece of
life for the next generation. In her
massive bodywas her own life. The
next morning the infant was found
dead—of concussion, the autopsy
concluded. The ape had probably lunged
for cover, holding her baby in one arm,
and accidentally smashed it against
a rock.

Much was learned about the maternal
instinct of gorillas in those few days,
however. Before this episode, it was

 

thought that captive gorillas
were not fit to be mothers;
early attempts at the Los
Angeles Zoo to allow the
offspring to remain with
the parent had resulted in
several cases of abandonment
and fatal beatings. One mother
are her infants as soon as
they were born. The young
mothers were not able to
express their nurturing
instincts, so the thinking
went, and frustration had
no outlet but rage.

Breeding in captivity is
a relatively recent program
in the history of zoo gorillas.
As recently as 20 years ago,
the animals were wrenched
from the wild, the mothers
killed and the young taken.
At the time, zoo ofﬁcials
assumed that the survivors,
being raised by human keepers, had
not learned the complex skills of handling
and nurturing a simian infant. And
because gorillas have always been so
valuable—the going price now is about
$75,000—zoos would isolate the females
as soon as they became pregnant in
order to ensure a bland, safe pregnancy.
After the delivery, the keepers would
snatch the infants away to the zoo nursery.
Females were sometimes anesthetized
on entering labor so that the infants
could be removed quickly. In the case
of the cannibal mum, births were by
Caesarean section. -

Today, the Los Angeles Zoo is about
to challenge the idea that a zoo-born
gorilla is incapable of quality mothering,
partly because Dianne, until the time
of her loss, was performing remarkably
well. Although she was born in the
wild, she was taken into captivity at
about 1 year of age.

The implied conclusion is that
mothering may be far more innate than
leamed—that the basic desires and

SAN DIEGO - Casual visitors — and
there are three million of them a year —
approach the San Diego Zoo rather as if it
were an animal museum. They come here
to see a spectacular menagerie of careful-

rarely disappointed.

There are 100 acres here, teeming

meaning of the discreet E for Endangered
that marks so many of the exhibits. Yet it
is that E which has changed the function
of the zoo. "

Fifty years ago, zookeepers were still
collectors. They harvested specimens
from,the wealth of the wild. Today, their
roles have nearly been reversed. The wild
is an endangered species itself, and the
zoo is at times the last haven and source

ers to producers of animals."

the real mission of the zoo is located else-
where, in the ramshackle buildings that
house CRES, the Center for the Reproduc-

Throughout the world, species are dis-

appearing at a rate of 100 a year. The last
of the free-ﬂying condors was just taken
t0clive in captivity 40 miles away in the
200‘s Wild Animal Park. Here a team of
scientists — geneticists, pathologists, be-
haviorists — are working to save, replen-
ish and perhaps even to return some of
these creatures. ,

“We haven’t yet suffered catastrophic
losses,” says Oliver Ryder, a committed
man and geneticist, “So time is impor-
tant." At CRES they are pressing to learn
how to help animals do in captivity what
comes naturally in the .wild: bear off-
spring.

CRES has set up a computerized cap-

about the reproduction systems of a vari-

There have been some remarkable
success stories. Ryder tells in glowing de-
tail the story about the Mongolian horse,
a creature unseen in the wild since 1968,
a victim of nomads and domestic animals
that usurped their water supply. There
were once only 13 such horses in the

”real world.” Others cannot be reintro-
duced to homelands that are now farms.
No human family would welcome the re-
turn of Cheetahs — however rare and
beautiful — to its neighborhood.

This hi-tech fertility clinic, the com-

’mitment of its team, is enormously im-

pressive. But you cannot visit without

separate manhunts by scouts left

.. 10-3 — The Tampa Tribune

Toad helps
, bring back
memories

The creatures once were
in abundance in the area,
‘but Navy construction
probably led to their
scarcity.

MAYPORT (AP) — When a 10-
year-old girl on spring break found
a horned toad on the north bank of
the St. Johns River near here, it
prompted some Mayport natives to
recount how the Western creatures
got here originally.

Michelle and Sabrina Parker of
Palm Valley were spending their
vacation with their grandparents,
.Bill and Marjorie Parker, on Fan-
ning Island when Sabrina spotted
the creature scurrying through the
brush in a neighboring lot.

Michelle, 10, picked up the
horned toad, which is actually a liz-
zard, and carried it across the yard
for her grandmother to see.

Marjorie Parker recognized the
fearsome-looking beast for the
harmless creature it actually is. She
grew up in Mayport, where the
toads proliferated in the 19305.

.The sight of the horned toad

prompted her to call Helen Cooper
Floyd, her sister-in-law in Pascagou-
la, Miss, who had written several
articles about the horned toad and
;its history in Duval County.

‘ Horned toads were once com-
mon in Texas and the Southwest,
but pesticides have now played a
role in their gradual disappearance.

Floyd said horned toads were
not seen in the county until J. Ed-
win Messmore traveled to San Anto-
nio, Texas, on doctor’s orders be-
cause of his rheumatoid arthritis.

He shipped a crate with six
horned toads back to his daughter,
Marjorie Messmore Todd, who now
.lives near the Intracoastal Water-
(way.

Todd said the six horned toads
«arrived at the Mayport station.

“It was 58 years ago. I gave one
of them to the Railway Express
clerk for his son and I took five
home.”

“I’m 64 years old now and I was
about 6 years old then. I had to feed
'them live insects. They wouldn’t eat
anything dead. So I took a piece of

meat and-held it over an ant mound
to get live ants and fed them that.
Then I had to try to stun ﬂies with-
out killing them.

“I only had them about two
weeks and someone told my mother
that the juice they spit was poison-
ous and if the juice got into your
eye, it would blind you. And I was
getting stung by the bull ants. So she
made me turn them out.” ’

The horned toads apparently
found the pristine sand dunes of the
Mayport area to their liking and
thrived and multiplied rapidly.

By the mid-19305, boys found the
lizards were harmless and fun to
catch.

Bill Parker recalls selling some
to city slickers at ball games.

The boys would have contests to
see who could catch them most and
Floyd vividly remembers boys put-
ting them in the desk drawers of
teachers at Fletcher High School.

“‘The boys were delighted at
(the teachers’) reactions. I‘ re-
member seeing Mrs. Florence Bea-
ver opening her drawer and finding
a horned toad there. She jumped up
and screamed. I don’t remember if
what she said was printable.”

Floyd’s husband, Hilton, said the
boys enjoyed harnessing the toads
to matchboxes and watching them
pull the boxes like sleds through the
sand.

The arrival of the Navy at May-
port, with all its construction in the
19403, probably led to the scarcity
of horned toads in the area.

No one knows how the horned
toad that Michelle and Sabrina
found was able to get across the riv-
er from Mayport, but Marjorie
Parker thinks the creature captured
by her granddaughter is a grand-
child, numerous greats removed, of
those first six horned toads that
Messmore sent his daughter from

Texas. . .

gulls protested

The Federal Fish and Wildlife Service, which usual-
ly defends wildlife vigorously, was in the uncomforta-
ble position of proposing to poison some sea gulls in
the Cape Cod, Mass, area.

There were so many black-backed and herring gulls
on Monomoy Island, off the Cape, the service said in
December, that they were forcing out smaller, rarer
birds. When the island became a federal wildlife ref-
uge in 1963, it had but five nesting pairs of common
gulls, the agency noted. The total in 1986 was put at
20,000 pairs.

spread margarine and a poison called 1339 on bread
and drop the bait in selected gull nests.

The public has responded with “almost 140 letters,”
most urging that the gulls be spared, said Anne Hecht,
an agency planner in Newton Corner, Mass. “We’re
evaluating the comments, developing a final plan.”

The goal is to keep at least 90 of Monomoy Island’s
2,750 acres free of common gulls, so four species of
terns, along with laughing gulls and piping plovers,
can again nest in the area, Ms. Hecht said.

Once a common gull is nested, she noted, “it’s pretty
hard to move that gull.” That leaves three alternatives:
“We might use nest and egg destruction. We might use
shooting. We might use poisoning.”

, Rory’s exam had gone smoOthly and}
quickly, a drastic contrast to the first
orangutan case that Stoller had in 1986,

.. when Stoller, a professor and chairman
of the division of periodontics at the Uni-
versity of Colorado School of Dentistry,
began studying periodontal disease --
diseases of the bone and tissues around
teeth - in orangutans. -'

Stoller’s patient then was Samu, a 300-

pound male. He had stopped eating, and .

had lost between 20 and 30 pounds within
a month. Galle wasn’t certain what was
ailing Samu. However, because peri-
odontal disease occurs so frequently in
orangutans, he made sure Stoller, who
had recently completed a study of peri- -
odontal disease in snow leopards, was
present when they examined Samu.

“And it turned out that the sole cause
”of his problems was periodontal dis- ‘

ease,” said Stoller.
“Most dental disease in humans, un-
less it’s really advanced, doesn’t create
, really bad breath. But in orangs and
. dogs, the two animals I’ve looked at ex-
tensively, the most noteworthy thing is
the stench.”

“It’s kind of a dead, musty smell,” stu-‘

dent Ela added helpfully. She has as-
sisted Stoller on four of his trips to exam-
ine orangutan gums, and will perform a
root canal on an orangutan in an upcom-
.ing trip. ‘

“When we‘did Samu, the smell was so ’

bad it was hard to be in the same room
with him,” Stoller continued.
“But by the time we cleaned up his
teeth and got rid of the ones that were
badly involved, the animal smelled ‘

. greatly better. Tolerable.”

. Rory, in contrast, smelled just fine —
for an orang. His dental exam was ex-
ploratory, part of a physical that Chey-
enne Mountain Zoo routinely conducts
when it sends animals. to other zoos. Ro-

- ry and the other orangutan that Stoller
examined one morning were both bound
for Florida. Cheyenne Mountain Zoo’s
orangutan population is the most prolific
in the United States. Since 1961, 29 orang-
utans have been born here. The zoo can’t
keep all of them, so it sends extra orangs
to less fortunate zoos. ‘

The orangutans attracted Stoller’s .at-
tention because of their predisposal to
y‘ periodontal disease. Snow leopards tend
* to suffer from periodontaldisease, too,
but after studying them for two years,
" Stoller found that the animals generally '

’ died before the disease became devas-

tating. .

Tperiodontal disease in orangutans seems"
to resemble periodontal disease in hu- ,
5 ‘ mans as well.

, “Norm’s work is very important to us '
because periodontal disease is a serious '

them heresigaue e19 -

“Oran s aren’t as prone to cavi-
ties — tEey don’t eat as‘much Junk
food as we do — but they do get
dental diseases. And periodontal
disease, if uncorrected, ultimately
results in losing all the teeth. Be-
fore Norm started coming here, I
pulled 10 teeth from an orang once
-— an old animal. Most of the teeth
were so loose they fell out.” .

Galle, who has file cabinets
filled with physical and dental
charts on each animal in the zoo,
generally remembers the names of ._ .
his patients. Stoller rarely does. _

“I’m more interested in the aca-

'v

demlcs — how they compare to hu- '

mans, and what their disease looks
like compared to human disease,”
he said. .

“It looks like they get very se-
vere disease on certain teeth and
none at all on others. But we’ve on-
ly seen a few animals, and that
may be something specific to this
colony of orangs. We tend to con-
centrate a study on one species at
a time.”

After examining two orangutans
.named Rudy and Rosie, Stoller and
Ela looked at slides of bacteria
scraped from the orangs’ teeth;

-- -.. andX-rays of their teeth and jaw-

bones. The bacteria associated
, with periodontal disease showed up
on the dark field slides as bits of

light in the shapes of sluggish cork- .

screws and darting missiles. The
X-rays showed Rudy’s developing
wisdom teeth, as well as Rosie’s
severe bone loss, which is so bad
that Stoller predicts she will proba-
bly begin losing teeth in a few
years. -

“I probably know more about
the periodontal status of orangs
than anyone else in the world,”
Stoller said. Then he added, more

modestly, “That’s because nobody
i. else in the world studies the sub-
f. ject. We pretty well know how to

Orangs, on the other hand, live typical-‘
1y to be 45 to 50 years old — long enough .

that if an orangutan’s gums are badly in-
fected, it could lose all of its teeth.
.‘ Orangutans also interested Stoller be-

. cause of their similarity to humans. Not -

only does an orang have 32 teeth and a ’
'. periodontal anatomy like a human’s, but

{prevent periodontal disease in hu-
mans, but we have to develop dif-
“ferent strategies of prevention in

publish an article, and hope that it
stirs attention from other zoos, and
hope that people will look at ani-
mals in the way we’re looking at
them, so we know what the pattern
of the disease really looks like.
“Of course,” he said wistfully, -
“what would really be great would
be to find out what they’re like in

the wild, but that’s almost impossi-
éable. Anyway, once we understand ‘
what happens, we’ll be better able
E to prevent it.”

Stoller gently inspected the cavernous
month (if his 6-year-old patient, whose
gums displayed evidence of periodontal

patient suddenly stirred, shifting one
very long, furry orange arm.

“I think he’s starting to come out of

nize the sleeping patient, a young orang-
utan named Rory. Earlier that morning,
Rory had been so heavily sedated that he

nation with an apparent peace that many
human dental patients would envy. If

' orangutans dream, Rory appeared to be

ATLANTA JOURNAL - May 12, 1987 ‘

Now in captivity,
6 of 85 left will
be freed in NC.

By Charles Seabrook

Science/Medicine Writer

 

 

In a vast, isolated, swampy area along
the North Carolina coast, the red wolf,
which once roamed freely throughout much
of the Southeast, may regain its wild heri-
tage.

The red wolf is extinct in the wild. But
later this month, wildlife officials will re-
lease three pairs of captive wolves into the
120,000-acre Alligator River National Wild-
life Refuge, near the Outer Banks of North
Carolina.

There, where stands of bald cypress and
black gum trees dominate the landscape,
the animals will be left on their own, either
to perish or thrive.

It will mark the first time that a crea-
ture, extinct in the wild, has been bred in
captivity and reintroduced to its native
grounds to roam freely and perpetuate its
species. Similar programs have bolstered
endangered populations of the wh00ping
crane, the sandhill crane and the peregrine
falcon, but those species never became ex-
tinct in the wild.

The US. Fish and Wildlife Service cap-
tured the last free-roaming purebred red
wolves in the 19705; the 85 alive today are
survivors of that roundup or their descen-
dants.

If the cinnamon-colored wolf can estab-
lish itself once again in its natural wood-
land habitat, it may serve as a model for
reintroducing other vanishing breeds, in-
cluding the Florida panther, the California
condor and the gray wolf.

“The hope, of course, is that the red
wolf will thrive.” says Warren T. Parker of
the Fish and Wildlife Service’s endangered
species field station in Asheville, NC. “No
one expects the animal to once again be-
come widespread, but we believe it can sur-
vive on its own in some isolated refuges.”

Red wolves roamed the Southeast until
a federal “predator control” program and
the destruction of their habitats during the
past century destroyed most of the animals.
The last wild pOpulation existed in the early
19705 in a marshy, mosquito-infested area
in the extreme southwest section of Texas
and southeast Louisiana.

On that marginal habitat, the few re-
maining red wolves were falling prey to se-

3 vere infestations of heartworms, hookworms

and mange. -

If the current project fails to re-estab-
lish the red wolf in the wild, the only salva-
tion for the species may be zoos, Parker
says.

Two pilot projects, however, already
have shown that captive red wolves, once
they are “acclimated” to a life in the wild,
can regain their natural survival wits. A
pair of the wolves set loose on Bull’s Island,
SC, a wildlife refuge about 40 miles north
of Charleston, in 1976 and 1978 caught rab-
bits and other small game and were surviv-
ing on their own.

However, the wolves eventually escaped
from the island by swimming across coastal
rivers and traversing the salt marshes to
reach the mainland. The animals quickly
were recaptured. . ‘

“The Bull’s Island projects were never
intended to be permanent,” says Parker.
“But we learned some valuable lessons that
we have applied to our present efforts to
permanently reestablish the red wolf in its
natural habitat.”

The Alligator River National Wildlife
Refuge was chosen because it lies within
the former range of the red wolf, and it is
a sparsely settled area surrounded on three
sides by large expanses of water — Albe-
marle, Croatan and Pamlico sounds -— and
on the fourth side by the Alligator River.

There, where the American alligator
reaches its northernmost limit, white-tailed
deer, marsh rabbits, squirrels and other
mammals abound, and they will serve as
prey for the wolves. Also, the 120,000 acres
of the refuge provide enough elbow room
for the animals.

The effort to re-establish the redwolf __
in the wild began last November, when'foun'

pairs of the animals were flown from
breeding facilities in Tacoma, Wash, and
St. Louis, Mo., to a holding compound at the
North Carolina wildlife refuge.

There, they were fitted with radio-trans- .

mitting collars and placed in large pens,
and their contact with humans was kept to
an absolute minimum. For the first two
months, they were fed and watered. But in
January, they were given carcasses of the
animals on which they prey in the wild, and
during the following weeks the wolves were

gradually “acclimated” to subsisting wholly

on live and dead prey.

on their own,” says Parker. .

Later this month, three of the four pairs
of wolves will be released from the holding
pens and allowed to run free on the refuge.
The fourth pair will serve as a backup in
the event anything happens to any one of
the other three pairs.

In addition, one of the three females
that will be released will be fitted with a
device to prevent her from mating right
away.

“We want to determine if she has any
survival advantage over the other females,
who may be pregnant,” says Parker. “The
added stress of pregnancy may make rein-

troduction to the wild more difficult.”

The project will be declared a success
when red wolf offspring are born in the
Wild and they themselves reproduce, in es-
sence giving birth to grandbabies of the
originally released wolves.

But while wildlifeofficials have strug-
gled to reintroduce red wolves to their na-
tive habitat, it has been an equally tough
job to get humans used to the idea of
wolves roaming wild again.

Previous plans to introduce the red wolf
on refuges in Kentucky and Tennessee were
shelved because of Opposition from the pub-
lic, which feared that the wolves would
prey on livestock and pets, and even people.

' Wildlife officials say part of the opposi-
tion also is due to the unnatural fear that
the word “wolf” triggers in people.

“We are raised from the cradle to
grave to fear wolves, starting with those
stories "The Three Little Pigs’ and ‘Little
Red Riding Hood,’ ” says Curtis Carley,

head of the red wolf captive breeding pro-

gram. “Frankly, our biggest problem is not
biology but public misconceptions.”

Parker says, however, that such fears
are unfounded for the red wolf. Red wolves
do not hunt in packs like gray wolves and

are shy and secretive. They will seldom be
seen, says Parker.

“The fundamental question is if we can-
not do this in a relatively secluded area
like Alligator River, where are we ever go-
ing to be able to do it?” he says.

Other wildlife experts, involved in other
preposed projects to reintroduce endangered
species to the wild, are mulling over the
same question, and will be keeping a close

eye on the red wolf project to see if it

“Now they should be ready to survive. works.

LaSt month, West Coast biologists cap-
tured the last remaining wild California
condor, and the bird has joined 26 other
members of its species in two zoos in an ef-
fort to breed it in captivity and rescue the
species from extinction.

their day (’11 week)

By PANKY SNOW
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA -- National Be Kind to
Animals Week and National Pet
Week will end in a blaze of glory
this year.

The reason? They coincide with
the 75th anniversary of the Tampa-
based Humane Society. To cele-
brate the occasion, the Humane So-
ciety of Tampa Bay will stage a free
Animal Fun Festival from noon un-
til 4 pm. Saturday at its 3607 N.
Armenia Ave. home.

According to Phil Snyder, execu-
tive director of Tampa's animal
shelter, there will be demonstra-
tions in dog obedience by the Dog
Training Club of Tampa and by
Florida Highway Patrol's canine
unit. Wildlife Rescue and Rehabili-
tation Inc. will display farm ani-
male. The Humane Society’s mas-
cot, a 7-foot person costumed as a
dog called “Paws.” will greet visi-
tors.

Tours of the recently renovated
facility also will be held.

The Humane Society emphasizes
a pet owner's responsibility, urging
pet owners to:

0 License their pet according to
local laws and to have it wear an ID
tag at all times.

0 Keep the pet leashed or ‘under
control for its own safety and to
keep it from being a public nul-
sauce.

0 Spay or neuter the pet for its
own health and to reduce the dog
and cat overpopulation.

0 Give the pet a nutritious diet,
water, plenty of exercise and prop-
er veterinary care with vaccina-
tions.

0 Keep the pet in the home,
training it patiently and giving it
lots of love and attention. -

Meanwhile, area pet shops are
busy selling pet owners the latest
products to pamper their pets.

Some of those include blue, red
or black over-theshoulder pet-car-
rying bags; gerbil and hamster exer-
cise tread wheels attached to plastic
locomotives or drag racers; a new
version of a scratching post that
consists of three sisal fiberocovered
posts shaped into a pyramid; and
overhead dog trolley exercisers of
rust-proof line

Although not available at local
pet stores yet, a new piece of doggie
equipment is a dog seatbelt. There
also is a car seat for dogs that con-
sists of a metal plate that can be
bolted to the car floor and that has
a strap going over the seat and
around the dog’s waist.

The Humane Society also car»
ries a line of pet care equipment.

Persons wishing additional infor-
mation on the Animal Fun Festival
may call the Humane Society, 876-
7138.

LOS ANGELES TIMES - May 3, 1987

There’s No Rescue in Bill -

mar." ~ ~-~.. ,

to ‘Save’ Pound Animals

By FRANKIE L. TRULL

Animal-rights proponents have a para-
doxical and double-edged item on their
current agenda: support of a bill now before
Congress that would kill twice as many
animals as it would “save" and which
would raise the cost of medical research by
about $70 million per year to boot. .

The bill, sponsored by Rep. Robert J.
Mrazek ( D-N.Y. ), would prohibit the use of
animals from pounds and shelters by any
researcher who holds a grant from the
National Institutes of Health, the largest
single source of support for biomedical
research in this country.

Proponents of the bill have concluded
that forcing scientists to turn to animats
specially bred for research will some-how
save the lives of pound animals.

In truth, most pound animals face certain
destruction because no one wants them.
That means that researchers would have to
pay the high cost of purpose-bred animals
while dogs and cats in pounds die anyway.

At issue is the notion that animals that
find their way to the nation’s pounds and
shelters ultimately will be reclaimed by
their owners or adopted into new homes,
provided that their release to research or
educational institutions does not preclude
such a happy outcome.

The facts, however, tell a different story.

Contrary to popular belief, most pound
dogs and cats—the estimates range as high
as 80%—are brought to what is usually
their final destination by their owners.

For the vast majority of pound ani-
mals—more than 10 million dogs and cats
each year—the next step is not adoption
but death after a holding period of three
days to two weeks.

Most pounds and animal shelters have
neither the space nor the funds to keep
them alive any longer. '

Of those 10 million animals, a small
number—fewer than two out of every 100

dogs and cats left in pounds—are released
for use in education and research to
medical schools, veterinary schools and
research facilities. ' .

Many such animals are critical to inves-
tigations of human and animal health
problems.

Pound-derived dogs, for example, have
played an important role in the advances
made in the treatment and prevention of
heart and lung diseases during the the past
several decades. Cats are valuable in
studies involving physiology and the ner-
vous system, research into blindness and
deafness, virology and certain cancers.

Some animals are used in nonsurvival-
p: ire surgery to help train future physi-

cians and veterinarians. The surgery takes

place under anesthesia from which the
animal never wakes.

What would happen if pound animals
were no longer available for research?

In addition to the extra senseless loss of
animal life—including the pound animals
that will die anyway as well as the
purpose-bred animals that will be required
to replace them for research—the cost of
research would rise significantly.

The Congressional Office .of Technology
Assessment has estimated a difference in
price of up to $500 between a pound-de—
rived dog and a purpose-bred animal.
Multiplied by the number of dogs and cats
needed in research, that difference adds up
to $70 million or more each year.

Research grants will not increase by this
amount to accommodate a new govern-
ment directive. The rise in the costs of
research requiring 'dogs and cats wrll
discourage many researchers from pursu-
ing promising areas of scientific investiga-
tion. ‘

Other scientists may have no choice but
to shift to less scientifically reliable re-
search models. The result will be delays in
knowledge that could help solve human
and animal health problems.

ty.

Animal Control, it will not be re-

leased to owner without verification
of inoculation record and payment of

costs of pickup and handling.

The bill’s supporters say that the Na-
tional Institutes of Health has a policy
against the use of pound animals. This
claim, too, is inaccurate.

While the National Institutes of Health
does not obtain animals directly from
pounds, it does use “random source” dogs
and cats for its in-house research projects.
By definition, these are animals from a
variety of sources and are not purpose-
bred animals from dealers licensed. by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture and regu-
lated under the federal Animal Welfare
Act. The dealers obtain the animals from a
number of sources, including pounds and
shelters.

No one enjoys using animals in research.
But the fact remains that for the foresee-

progress. _ ,-

POPULAR WITH TOURISTS: The horses on Cumberland make great piCtures for visitors [to the
island, and because of their popularity the Park Service is reluctant to remove or kill any of them.

HOFSGS HI FROM 1b

growing horse population.

Considering the popularity of
the wild horses with national sea-
shore visitors, the Park Service is
reluctant to propose removing the
animal's from the island, or killing
some of them to reduce the pepula-
tion. . ,

Susan Bratton, a University of
Georgia scientist who is studying
Cumberland’s wild horse herds, said
the horses ranked No. 1 with Cum-
berland visitors.

“I sympathize with the visitors.
They love seeing the horses,” Dr.
Bratton said. “But I sympathize
with the dunes and the marshes,
too.” .

Robin Goodloe, a doctoral candi-

 

date who works with Dr. Bratton, is '
conducting an experiment that may

provide the Park Service with a
means of dealing with the problem
while satisfying the public’s desire
to see wild horses. '

Ms. Goodloe is using an experi-
mental birth control drug on some
of the Cumberland Island mares,
administering the drugs in Specially-
designed biodegradable pellets,
which she fires into the mares'
flanks from distances of up to 40
yards. ’

“It doesn’t seem to hurt them

. very much,” Ms. Goodloe said.
*“They usually startle a little, as
grthough they’ve been stung by a fly
or something. The nice‘thing about
; these pellets is that we don‘t have
; to handle or immobilize the horses
in order to administer it.”
‘ Although it will be next year be-
; fore Ms. Goodloe‘ knows if the pro-

gram is successful, she said prelimi-
nary results indicate the birth
control pellets are not harmful to
the horses, even to pregnant or
nursing mares. .

If the drug works as intended, it
will give the ParkService the 0p-
tion of controlling the number of
horses in a humane way and keep-
ing a small herd on the south end of
the island where most visitors could
see them.

However, the island’s major ero-

sion problems are on the south end,

where historic ruins and scenic ar-
eas are threatened by crumbling
banks.' - j

Horses are not native to Cum-

berland, though they may have been _

brought to the island more than 200
years ago. A Park Service report
speculated that some of the animals
may be descendants of horses that
escaped when the Spanish invaded a
British fort on Cumberland in 1742.
A few years later, a band of

 

' ‘ members

renegades who called themselves
the'Florida Rangers occupied Cum-
berland and may have left horses

behind when they fled.

According to the report, about
200 horses and mules were on Cum-
berland in 1785 and again in the

' 18603, at the end of the plantation

era.
Earlier inthis century, when

_ Cumberland was privately owned by

the wealthy Carnegie family, which
still owns land on the island, family
imported fresh stock,

which they turned out to graze with
the horses already there.

Many of the Cumberland horses
have the distinctive spotted rumps
of an appaloosa stallion that bred
with island mares.

Cumberland’s head ranger, Kev-
in Kacer, said it will probably be
several years before the Park Ser-
vice makes any prOposal about the
island horses. And before any deci-
sion, the public will have a chance
to comment, Kacer said.

So far, individuals and organiza-
tions familiar with Cumberland
seem to agree with the Park Ser-
vice that the horses are causing

problems.

Bill Mankin, Cumberland Island
issues chairman with the Sierra
lub in Atlanta, said his organiza-
tion wants the horses off Cumber-
land because of damage to the is-
land’s environment. - ‘ “
“We would prefer the horses not

be on the island,” Mankin said.
while acknowledging their popula‘ri- '
ty. . . .
“if they weren’t so pOpular. the
Park Service would have probably .
done something about a number of 1
them some time ago,” he said.

 

 

 

 




ATLANTA JOURAM‘L ”ﬁg-CONSTITUTION - May 3, 1987

DIANNE LAAKSO/ Staff

A GROWING POPULATION: This foal, following two other horses, is one of 14 wild horses born on Cumberland this
year, bringing the number there to more than 180, which poses a threat to the environment, park ofﬁcials say.

Animals enchant Cumberland visitors but damage environment

 

By Jingle Davis
Special to The Journal-Constitution

CUMBERLAND ISLAND, Ga. —
A spindly legged foal stayed close
by its mother as she grazed with a
‘ small band of wild horses in a high
marsh on the south end of Cumber-
land Island.

The foal, one of 14 born on the
island so far this spring, posed an
enchanting picture for visitors who
had come to the national seashore
to enjoy its dense forests, sun-span-
gled beaches and wealth of wildlife.

But the wild horses of Cumber-
land also pose a serious problem for
the National Park Service, the agen-
cy charged with managing the is-

 

land and maintaining its natural,

beauty. _
According to park Superinten-
dent Ken Morgan, the horse pOpula-
tion — now estimated at more than
180 - has increased to the point
that the horses are threatening
Cumberland’s environment.

Morgan said the horses wanderi

the picturesque dunes, cr0pping;
fresh stalks of sea oats and tramp:
ling plants that help anchor thei
huge mounds of sand against the!
wind.

“If you pull up sea oats, you can
be arrested, but the horses eat them
with impunity,” said .Bob Hurt, aide
. to lst District Congressman Lindsay

Thomas, who recently visited Cum-
berland and saw firsthand the dam-
age done to the island by horses and
other animals. ,

The horses also graze freely in
the marshes, stripping away the
lush spartina grass and compacting
the marsh mud into a hard clay
that supports little vegetation, leav-
ing the bare banks vulnerable to
erosion.

Even Cumberland’s magnificent
live oak trees are in danger, not
only from the horses but from wild
hogs, which root up the ground with
rototiller efficiency, and the island’s
deer papulation, now estimated at
3,000. Standing on their hind legs,
even the small island deer can strip
a tree of new growth up to a height
of almost 6 feet.

“The oak seedlings on Cumber-
land never have a chance to grow
very high,” Morgan said. “As soon
as they put on new shoots, they’re
cropped off.” When Cumberland’s
mature oaks die off, Morgan said,
there may be no new oaks coming
up to replace them.

While the Park Service is trying
to control Cumberland’s deer and
hogs, in part through managed
hunts, Morgan said there is no deci-
sion on how to deal with the island’s

“It appears to be a classic exam-
ple of protection of young,” O’Neill
said, adding that Gibbs “knew
what he was getting into. The hu-
man in this case was the intruder.”

Gibbs’ wife, Glenda, said her
husband, an avid wildlife photogra-
pher, loved grizzly bears and would

William Tesinsky was killed by a
grizzly in Wyoming’s Yellowstone
National Park. His camera gear
was found next to his body.

acknowledged she cultural conflict. “But
the central question is whether the Ameri—
can people want to see the commercializa-
tion of our wildlife," Wheeler said. “We
think the answer is no." .

State bans sale of beer parts
.4 California law allows licensed bear
hunters to bag one bear per year. But no
bear parts, taken legally or illegally, may
be sold. Persons who do so face a maximum
$5,000 fine and a year in prison.

Nabbing the commercial hunters has
been a big task for the Fish and Game De—
partment. . '

On Black Fox Mountain — a well-known
bear area near Mount Shasta in northern
California -— Lt. Bob Gray noted that each
game warden polices an area spanning
about 1,600 miles of rough, precipitous,
heavily-timbered terrain. The chances of
catching one of the outlaws with the in-
criminating evidence in the middle of the
night - when the poachers do their dirty
work — are ‘-‘minimal,” Gray said.

And, with bear gall selling for as much
as $340 an ounce. or more than $3,000 per
gall bladder, the potential payoff is high. At
these prices, officials said, the market in
bear gall is almost as lucrative as cocaine,
and much less risky.

Officials say the criminals belong to a
loosely knit but sophisticated and mobile
ring consisting primarily of Caucasian
hunters, operating in several states in addi-
tion to California, and Korean distributors,
selling both in the US and abroad.

No one knows exactly how large the
criminal network is. But since 1981, when
investigators first revealed the magnitude
of the problem, fish and game officials have
made 234 arrests resulting in more than
200 convictions, according to DeWayne
Johnson, chief of wildlife protection.

To further infiltrate the black marke- .

teers, the Fish and Game Department, with
a $1 million appropriation, has established
three teams of undercover game wardens.
They began operation last year.

.“We‘re making headway," Johnson
said. But he noted that one conservative
study estimated the nationwide value of
commercial poaching — including deer, elk
and moose antlers “in the velvet," moun-
tain lion parts, falcon and eagle feathers,
rattlesnake parts, and bear claws and
paws, as well as bear gall bladders — to be

. at least $152 million annually.

“The commercialization of our wildlife
is still a tremendous problem, in California
and all over the country,” Johnson said.

ST. LOUIS POSTvDISPATCH - 4/30/87

i f Japan’s Curiosity *
Kills The “7 hale

Los Angeles Times

The g'reat whalers of the world,
coming up against the global morato-
rium on commercial operations, are
showing a new and remarkable in-
terest in research. Japan, for exam-
ple, which already had won a gener-
ous extension of the moratorium on

l-commercial whaling until next year,

has now served notice that it will
pursue 825 minke and 50 sperm

,4. whales next year for research.

Oh, yes: If there is anything left
after the re-
searchers get
through with it,
the meat will be
sold on the com-
mercial market.
Iceland is al-
ready deep into
whale research,
and just hap-
pens to have
enough surplus to export a substan-
tial amount to Japan.

All this would be funny if it were
not such an outrageous challenge to
the efforts of conservationists. But, to
make matters worse, it is entirely
legal. There is a loophole in the In-
ternational Whaling Convention that
allows all governments to permit the
harvesting of whales for research
purposes and to set the research lim-
its themselves.

The United States, which has ted
the battle to end whaling. is prepar-
ing to try to close the loophole. So it
should. A resolution will be offered
when the International Whaling
Commission convenes at Bourne-
mouth, England, on June 22 seeking
to make the position of the commis-

 

 

 

sion more precise and to correct a _

 

year-old resolution that seems to in-
Vite a perpetuation of whaling in the
gunse of research.

,What really needs doing is action
to enhance the authority and guide
lines for the commission’s scientific
committee so that it can decide what
is authentic, justifiable research.
That clarification cannot come too
soon. While the Soviet Union has now
suspended whaling, four other na-
tions have indicated plans for “re-
search” operations in the years
ahead.

The moratorium is to be reviewed
commencing in 1990 to determine
whether'it should be made perma-
nent. Tighter regulation of research
operations in‘the meantime is essen-

tial if that review is to be
. meaningful.

 




BOSTON GLOBE

California s out to get bear

By Judith Gaines
Special to the Globe

1 cs ANGELES — “Remember the
line in Shakespeare about those
witches brewing ‘eye of newt and

toe of frog’? Well. this is where

they did their shopping."

Capt. Richard Wheeler. a patrol supervi:
ear for California’s Department of Fish and
Game. is talking about a herb and acu-
puncture shop in a section of Los Angeles
known as “Little Korea.‘_’ There. on shelves
marked with Oriental characters. sat jars
of pigs feet ﬂoating in brown juices. dried
seshorses. water algae. extract of sea lion
heart. piles of large black mushrooms. and
bags of exotic. pungent herbs.

in a glass case, sandwiched between
tubes of tiger balm and packets of sliced
deer antlers were the main objects of
Wheeler' 8 concern: three unmarked plastic
containers with chunks of some dried, red-
dish-brown organ. He identified it as bear
gall bladder.

Wheeler did not arrest the shopkeeper
immediately but promised a team of under-
cover game wardens would return to inves-
tigate the store and the network supplying
' bear gall to it.

, Selling or buying bear gall is a felony in

California - to the dismay of Koresns. who
claim it has unique health-restoring prop-
erties and is an important part of their tra-
ditional culture. The illicit market also
poses an increasingly serious problem for
the state' 8 game wardens. who fear it
threatens the survival of the California
black bear.

With about 12.000 to 15.000 of these
bears left in the state. extinction is not an
immediate danger. according to Don Koch.
the state's bear biologist. But his studies re-
veal an alarming trend: about 1.000 bears
a yssr currently are dying in a way that
cannot be attributed to natural causes.
predators or reported legal kills.

The culprits. authorities believe. are
part of a sophisticated international net-
work trafficking in wildlife parts.
Angered by tactics

Bear watchers are especially worried by
one of Koch’s latest findings: more than
half of the state’s female bears are dying
before they reach 4% years. the minimum
breeding age. If the trend is not reversed.

the consequences could be very bad news ,

for the bears. whose health as a species is

gauged. at least in part. by reproductive,

rates.

Officials also are angered by the peach;

ers' tactics. “What we’ve been finding are

lots of bears. laid on their backs. with their ~

stomachs slit open. the gall bladders re—
moved, sometimes maybe the paws gone
too. and the rest of the carcass just left to
rot. ” said Wayne Kline. patrol chief in the
eight northern California counties where
two-thirds of all the bea1s are being killed.

Many thanks for your splendid
editorial on mountain lions (April
10). The Fish and Game Commis-
sion has received 19,000 letters and
signatures on petitions from those
who are opposed to trophy hunting
of mountain lions. In spite of this
overwhelming opposition, the
commission reopened the hunting
season on the cougar and licenses
will be issued to trophy hunters to
kill 190 lions whose only crime is
that they had the misfortune of
having been born as lions in Cali-
fornia.

We, who have testified before
the commission and worked our
hearts out to save these beautiful
and important predators from be-
ing hung on living room walls,
should regroup instead of moaning
and groaning about the loss of
these animals and work hard to-
ward having the structure of the
Fish and Game Commission
‘changed. The five commissioners,
all with strong pro-hunting lean-
ings, were appointed by the gover-
nor; the environmental concerns
are not represented. Since they
have the power to enact laws,
commissioners should be elected
just as legislators are. Only then
can we be assured that the deci-
sions made by the commission will
be fair, unbiased and balanced.

For the ﬁrst time in 15 years, the State Fish and Game

LOS ANGELES TIMES - April 25, 1987

For shame! The state of Califor-
nia has just entered a period of
darkness.

,. Under pressure from the gun
clubs and the so-called sportsmen,
the Fish and Game Commission has
reinstated the hunting of mountain
lions (Part I, April 11) for the
benefit of a few macho Neander-
thals who feel compelled to shoot
the big cats to satisfy their sadistic
impulses. The ugly spectacle of
‘ cornering this magnificent animal
with a pack of dogs and then ending
its life with a high—powered rifle is
an outrage on our wildlife and
should be outlawed once and for all.

It has long been the goal of gun
clubs and “sport shooters" to re-

_ open the hunting season on cou-
gars. The lame excuses given‘, such
as a threat to man and his property,
are used as valid reasons to justify
the cruel and barbaric tactics used
by hunters in tracking down and

“killing these animals. Talk about
violence in today's worlde—if this is
what we have to teach our chil-
dren, small wonder there isn’t
more.

Trophy hunting has always been
a symbol of senseless killing. It
reveals the darker side of man’s
nature and has no place in a
civilized society.
‘ ‘ ' ~ M. RITA STRICKLIN

Chatsworth

Would I be termed a “sports-
‘man” if I preferred to see 190
hunters chased by dogs who obvi-
ously would tear them to shreds as
they cannot climb trees, to then be
‘shot by very safe “sportsmen” in
Jeeps? Of course we would have to
stop short of killing or maiming
these fun-loving “sportsmen” be-
cause they are human beings.
What a pity they don’t bury their
‘guns and learn to be humane which
means a reverence for all life—in

Thank goodness the Fish and

mountain lion hunt.

For the cougar, deer and all.

game animals it was the right
decision. To manage populations of
game animals and harvest the
surplus has been a successful tool
with game management for years.
All other western states and
provinces have cougar manage-
ment programs and now California
joins their ranks—to protect and

manage the cougar-thereby se-.

curing its future for generations to

I see our political friends have
done it again by reinstating the
hunting season for mountain lions,
because “the population has grown
dangerously large.” -

Another “population” which is
far too large, and doubly dangerous
to the citizenry, are politicians, and
I might suggest a once-a-year open
season on them too. I’ll polish up
my gun in anticipation.

K. GOODISON

I was saddened and sickened by
the vote of the Fish and Game
Commission to end the moratorium
on sport hunting of mountain lions.

One large step backwards for
mankind.

One of. our reasons for being on

earth is to take care of God's

creatures-too bad they don’t have
the right to bear arms.

MARJORIE HIRSCH LOEB

. Los Angeles

They have sent us men to match

our mountain lions—ah, yes, and

next they would have us believe

that the “sport” of killing mountain

lions is really a splendid form of '

euthanasia for poor animals
tracked for days by teams of dogs
and men in the territorial habitat to
which the big cat is naturally
bound. They would have us believe
that splendid guns and splendid

bullets “take" mountain lions in a-

“merciful kill."

What kind of dangerous game of _

“tag” is this in which the California
Fish and Game Commission in a 3

' to 2 vote authorized the tagging of

mountain lions for eligibility into a
trophy hunting club? And this
“game” is not played with laser
guns. These splendid guns have
real sights and real bullets. They
far exceed the death sighting of
natural forces in which the big cat
has lived. Ah, but the hunter’s sight
is on target and the trained eyes of
the trophy hunters have the sights
and vision beyond that of all the
natural forces.

Such senseless authorization by
three members of the Fish and
Game Commission to “take” tagged
mountain lions for the “sport of it”
deserves careful testing and re-
sponses from answerable parties
representing the will of the people.
Is this decision by Fish and Game
clearly the intent of our Sacramen-
to legislators and governor? Will
the decision stand up in court?

The Mountain Lion Coalition,

 

P.O. Box 1896, Sacramento, CA,
95809, is deserving of our help in a
cause which should stop this sense-

less killing by trophy hunters of

the California mountain lion.
ETTA SIMPSON
Hermosa Beach

a

The decision by the members of
the Fish and Game Commission to
allow “sport" hunting of the moun-
tain lion in California is one that
represents neither the best inter-

. ests or the feelings of the majority

of the citizens of our state.

If public safety had been the
concern of the commissioners, then
they might have voted to allow the
hunting of mountain lions in
Southern California where the two
reCent attacks on children took
place rather than in Northern Cali-
fornia. Instead, the commissioners
voted to allow the hunt only in
Northern California.

If possible mountain lion over-
population had been the concern of
the commissioners, then they
might have voted to have a scien-

tific study done of the mountain

“on population before deciding
whether or not to allow a hunt.
Instead, the commissioners used
only their own estimates which are
not based on any scientific facts.

If the will of the citizens of this
state had been the concern of the
commissioners, then they would

have voted against any hunt at all, '

as did the members of the state
Legislature last year, when they
voted to extend the moratorium on
mountain lion hunting.

Clearly, the concern of the com-
missioners was for a small, but
moneyed minority that wants to
use our valuable heritage of wild-

life for their own selfish and de-
structive interests. ,

DAVID ADAMS

Los Angeles

I am saddened by as well as
disgusted with the decision to allow
the hunting of mountain lions.
Even if the mountain lion is not an
endangered species, the killing of
lions is not the answer to the
problems that human self -cen-
teredness has created. ‘

This earth does not belong solely
to humans. It belongs to every
creature on it. Management of
those creatures now that human
numbers have exceeded the carry-
ing capacity of this earth is neces-
sary, but killing as a management
tool is not only a short-term solu-
tion, but also one based on gut
reaction and therefore an ignorant
one.

Many people are mad at the
mountain lion for having attacked
children. Well, the lions are merely
managing their habitat the only
way they know how—by killing
intruders and by hunting for food.
We can do better.

We have the intellect to allow us.
to manage in a more humane
manner. Do we really need to kill a
mountain lion for “intruding" into
habitat that we’ve invaded? Or do
we recognize that this world can
have room for all creatures as long
as we do not try to make all of it
ours?

.We must realize that we cannot
live or travel just anywhere we
want in complete, safety unless we
sterilize this planet of all but
domestic species. And even then
we would not be safe from our-
selves. Perhaps the Department of

 

   
 




 

 

 

 

By Dale Champion

Defenders of mountain
lions are loading their weapons
to Sabotage sport hunting of the
big cats next fall.

Drawing on widespread opposi-
tion to the hunt, lion protection
forces hope to take over a lottery
planned by the state Department Of
Fish and Game to select permits for
killing 190 cougars.

Karen Pickett, San Francisco
Bay Area coordinator for the envi-
ronmental activist group called
Earth First!, said it has several hun-
dred dollars as a nest egg tO get the
anti-hunting campaign rolling.

“We have in mind a very grass
roots approach,” she said from her
home in Canyon, a woodsy Contra
Costa community behind the Oak-
. land hills.

‘ “All kinds of people have been
wanting to do something to show
their outrage at. the state Fish and
‘ Game Commission‘s decision to al-
low trophy hunting Of the mountain
lion. We want. a way for individuals,
~ many not affiliated with any organi-
zation, "to do something about the
decision. It was a slap in the public’ 5
face.”

For starters, she said, those Op-
posing the hunt will enroll in the
hunter training courses required by
the state for obtaining a hunting
license. Hunting foes will be expec-

‘ted tO bear any costs, nominal at

most, associated with those classes
. and to pay the $18.50 for a hunting
license, plus the $5 application fee
to enter the lottery for permits to
shoot mountain lions.

Money from a grass rOOts fund
drive, Pickett said, would be used to
cover the $75 special lion hunting
permit fee that will be charged the
190 winning applicants selected by

lottery

Nearly 20,000 letters and petio
tions bearing 65,000 signatures were
sent to the Fish and Game Commis-
sion in Opposition to the lion hunt,
, far outstripping support of it from
_sportsmen and ranching interests.

The hunt, approved by the com-

mission April 10 on a 3402 vote, will

be the first in 15 years. Sport hunt-
ing of cougars was banned by the
state Legislature from 1972 until the
end Of 1985, when Governor Deuk-
mejian vetoed a measure that
would have extended the moratori-
um.

Pickett said Earth First!, with
Bay Area headquarters in the tiny
unincorporated East Bay communi-
ty of Canyon, already has the back-
ing of two other organizations, the
Sea Shepherd Society of Los Ange
les and Action for Animals, based 1n
Oakland, in its move to derail the
lion lottery.

Sharon Negri of the Mountain
Lion Coalition, a research and edu.
cation organization, said it was not
endorsing the plans to hamper the
hunt. “We’re concentrating instead
on getting ready to file a suit
against the Fish and Game Commis-
sion within the next month,” Negri
said. “There might not even be a'
lottery if we get an injunction.
against the hunt. ~

“ ’v’e’re convinced that the com-
mission lacked enough information
to justify the. hunt and tO show that
it will not have a negative impact on
the mountain lion.”

Don Koch of the state Depart-
ment Of Fish and Game said applica-
tions for lion hunting permits will
become available June 1 at sporting
goods and bait shops and other
places that serve as outlets for pur-
chasing regular hunting licenses.

, Applications, from people 16
years or Older, must be submitted to
Fish and Game with a $5 fee by
August 14. Selection Of the 190 can-
didates for lion permits will be
made on August 21.

Up to 50,000 people are expec»
ted to apply for the lion permits.

Koch said he was not troubled
by the move by lion protectionists‘.
to capture as many permits. as possis
ble. “It s a free country,” Koch said.

“And it might be a positive experi-
ence for people of both philosophies .
on the hunting. issue tO get together ‘ .

' in hunter training classes. It certain-

ly will make for some interesting
training sessions. ”

thing like the magnified screech of a house-
cat. “I heard one last summer,” says Fjel-_ ;
. line. “It didn't sound like an African lion.
There’s really no way to describe it. It
wasn’t a roar or a meow, it was a coarse,
guttural yowl.”

Mountain lions have short, round
heads, long bodies and legs, and large feet.
Their earthcolored coats range from tawny
gray to cinnamon red, and they can grow up
to 220 pounds, but the average tomcat
weighs about 160 pounds, females 70 to 90
pounds. After an approximate three-month
gestation period, the female gives birth to
anywhere from one to four blind, defense-
less kittens, and stays with them for up to
two years.

Cougars are solitary animals; they kill
alone and live apart, except for a very brief
mating period. They are astoundingly agile;
they are thought to be able to make vertical
leaps of up to 18 feet and horizontal leaps of
more than 40 feet. They prey mostly on deer
and elk but also will consume porcupines,
wild hogs, rabbits, turkeys, foxes, birds, big-
horn sheep, goats, dogs, turtles, alligators
and snakes. With a healthy food supply, a
mountain lion can live up to 15 years.

Relying on lock

Because lions roam seven to 30 miles a
day, humans rely mostly on luck to catch up
with them. “They cover the country so dog-

' gone fast -—- they climb up and down those
canyons like it was nothing — what they,
cover in 20 minutes takes us all day,” Fjel- '1
line says.

As his truck snakes along the narrow
mountain roads, he sips coffee from a Ther-
mos and places a pinch of snuff between his
gum and cheek. Until 10:30 am, there has
been nothing. Deer tracks, bear and an 00-
casional old lion track, but nothing new.

Suddenly, he brakes the vehicle.
A lion track. A pretty new one, too.

In the daylight, it is barely perceptible
to the untrained eye, but a closer look re-
veals four toe pads and a three-ridged back
pad, exactly like the paw of your housecat,
only about three inches across at the toes.
The hounds, itching for a chase, immediate»
1y pick up the scent and, yapping loudly,
take off excitedly into the woods. Wylie
follows on foot; Fjelline stays behind.

One hour passes.

Fjelline hooks his fingers in his belt
loops, spits out the side of his mouth and
listens for his dogs. “That’s Katie, there, and
that’s Annie,” he says, pointing at the dense
forest, seeing nothing through the trees but
hearing everything. “I can tell exactly what
each dog is doing by listening to their barks.
Oh, there’s Dan. He’s the blabbermouth of
the bunch. I don’t much listen to him.”

Two hours go by.

The dogs are alternately barking, then
silent. “They’ve lost the scent,”‘says Fjel-

 

‘ line. “Something’s confusing them.” He.
, cocks his head. “Yep. That’s Billy. He’s frus-

trated.”

Another half hour is history. The barks

‘ drift from left to right behind the trees,

then the dogs cross the road far ahead of
Fjelline and, still sounding off, end up 300

-. yards down a steep canyon on the other
’ side, with Wylie not far behind. “That’s it.
We got.__something,” Fjelline yells, as the
barks change distinctly. The. hounds are
now letting out syncopated, lowthroated
yowls: CHOW. CHOW. CHOW. CHOW.
CHOW. “They only bark like that when
' they’ve got something up a tree,” he says,

and races down the canyon to see.
It’s a bobcat.

Eighty feet above, on the limb -of a
cedar tree, the beautiful wild feline stares

down at the bounds with lazy, golden eyes,
looking almost comfortable enough to Catch
a nap. “I’ve seem ’em fall asleep. You bet-
cha,” Fjelline says.

“The dogs got confused,” Fjelline ex-

plains, heading back up the canyon. “They
. were tracking the lion, but then the bobcat
came along. A cat’s a cat as far as they are
concerned.” -

Although the hunters came within 80

'9 feet of the bobcat, they were not in any
I danger. Neither one has ever been harmed

by a lion. The most serious occupational
hazards are ticks, rattlesnakes, poison oak,
bruised or broken limbs, and poked eyeballs
from the overgrown brush in the canyons.

‘This Is My Cathedrol'

They pile the hounds back into the
truck and continue along the isolated roads
looking for tracks, and then break for sand-
wiches and Pepsi. Sitting on a rock, Fjelline
takes a sip and gestures toward the canyon.
“Some people find their religion in a
church,” he says. “But this is my cathedral."

 

The rest of the day is spent scanning
logging roads, overgrown paths and em-
bankments along paved county roads for
more tracks. Sometimes a week goes by
without a Sighting. Sometimes they see four
lions in as many days. During this two-week
outing, they never treed a mountain lion.
“A lot of it is luck, and a lot of it has to do
with how well you communicate with your
dogs,” says Fjelline, as he heads back to
camp, about 20 minutes away, at about 5:30
pm.

The dogs are exhausted and sack out
underneath the pines Fjelline and Wylie
mix cocktails —— Early Times whiskey and
Pepsi -— and flip on the news. Dinner is New
York steak, broccoli and rice.

The next day, they repeat the process.
Doesn’t it get boring? .

“I think of this as a paid vacation,” says
Wylie.
Fjelline wonders whether the day will
, ever come when he is no longer needed.
“The saddest day for me to think about is
the day when there are no more lions. They
“:are my life.”

_ﬁ it ' “ ‘hunt
,Respecting «$9309. ..

Hunting is a sport enjoyed by many

pie. Some psychological studies

indicate it is an instinct remaining

‘ from a time when hunting was necess-

ary for survival. These studies reveal it

to be therapeutic for many and that it
helps prevent hostility in some.

To most hunters, it serves two
purposes. One is recreational, and the
other is for food. The latter should
always be a primary motivation.
Solomon warned that it was all right to
hunt but always wron to squander the
prey. He wrote, "'i‘ e slothful man
roasteth not that which he took ‘in
hunting: but the substance of a diligent

‘ man is precious" (Proverbs 12:27).

Moses wrote of distinguishing be-

tween "... beast that may be eaten and
' the beast that may not be eaten"
(Leviticus “247).

In the New Testament era, the voice
of the Lord was heard by Peter giving
instructions to "kill and eat". (Acts
10:13).

Later. Peter used an analo refer-
rln to“brute beast. made to taken
andzdestroyed ..." (11 Peter 2:12).

in both the Old and New Testaments,
killing and eating are linked. Thus the
princi al purpose for hunting is to
provi e food. Under no circumstance
should wild game taken in a hunt go
unused.

(’10 :4.

One of the most wasteful hunters l
have ever heard of once spoke of killing
over 100 birds a day. He spoke of such a
day as a “good day." He said he often
wished that he had a hundred hands sci
he could kill more. The record of hi ,
slaughter of wild animals is well
documented. Who he is. most people
don't know. His name is used by the

Most persons don't realize that most
of the wildlife he painted was dead,
though depicted as active. Much of it he
killed for use as models only.

There have always been persons who
violate any good principle whether it is ,

hunting or gardening. It is wrong to
categorize all as one. Likewise. it is
improper to classify any one hunter on
the basis of one shot — whether good or
bad.

significant price for the opportunity.

Nelson Price, pastor of Roswell Street ,
Baptist Church in Marietta, la a regular
columnist for the Marietta Daily Journal.

Where's hun ng's 'sport'?
EDITOR:

Your Iar columnist, the Rev.
Nelson rce, will host the annual
Men’s Game Dinner on Feb. 26 at
Roswell Street Baptist Church.
“Around Town" In a recent Marietta
Daily Journal reported that Price had

killed his limit of three deer near,

Washington, Ga.

I recall his column of Nov. 17, loss,
in which he admitted poor sports-
manship on a hunting trip in the

Ocmuigee River swamp. Price wrote: -

. "Just at the time of day when it is just
light enouﬁh to see and not light enough
to see we , l rested the cross-hairs of
my scope on a deer and squeezed the
trigger. The sound and the signs which

we soon found indicated a solid hit .

" (W)e trailed the deer into a thicker

part of the swamp. There we lost every -

f , clue of where the deer went ..."
He went on to describe an unsut
cessful search that lasted well into the
.‘ night. "Here was fun and togetherness
at its simplest and perhaps best."
" Most hunters prefer to say their

iff‘ .yictlms die instantly with the first shot.

' The Rev. Price's did not die quickl (as.
, many do not). lie or she dragged tself

.ggoff to bleed to death in terror and
'9’ agony. In no state is marksmanshi a'

',‘ prerequisite for a hunting license. he

‘ ;norm is that very few animals die

instantly.
Often hunters state they believe they

'3, are preserving the balance of nature

' and a noble American tradition. They
. feel they must kill some deer or the

‘ rest will starve. The fact is that the'
;, Dept. of Natural Resources works hard
’ to stock areas accessible to hunters”

with plenty of deer and carefully
cultivate ”browse" so that deer herds
will multiply rapidly. The herds'
natural predators, such as wolves and
mountain lions, have been trapped or
hunted to extinction so that they may
not compete with man for the kill. No
-‘ one can count the poacher's take. The
' herds are carefully manipulated by the
”wildlife managers" for the hunters.
As a predator, the hunter violates the
balance of nature. Natural predators
take the weak, genetically defective,
sick and the old, thereby maintaining a
strong gene pool. The hunter, on the
other hand, takes the finest —— the best
for his trophies of mounted heads and
antlers. The gene pool is becoming
weaker, and degeneration of the Speci-
;es can be documented. Rarely does a
hunter hunt for a true need for food.

,~ Hunters talk a lot of their love for '
nature and her children, but they go on

d inflicting slow or fast death on nature's

helpless animals. The real object of

‘ hunting is to kill animals. All the other
elements of the hunt -— the fellowship,
appreciation of nature, exercise,

' educational values -— are not hunting.
People find these benefits without
killing. And where is the “sport" when
one of the layers isn't aware that a
contest is ta ing place and doesn't have
the same equipment?

Finally, in his column a few years
ago, Nelson Price stated in writing of
ethical vegetarians like me. “They
don't believe in caualng suffering or
killing. Truly, needless killing is abhor-
rent." Wasn't it needless killing when
he bagged his three deer this season?
At Roswell Street Baptist Church, not
only venison but also snake. armadillo,
alligator, crocodile, moose, bear, elk
and assorted small game are on the
menu. Some have been on the en~
dangered species list at one time or
another. All have been gathered by
“needless killing." What kind of grace
can be said over such a meal?

Hunters’ lu

 

EDITOR:

The Rev. Nelson Price defends
hunters in his column Feb. 22, citing
instinct as a possible reason for
hunting. Don't our churches teach

:‘self-disci line ov r destru ' -
‘ "sﬁnct'? gerv little reat

cruelty shown y men can really_be

attributed toinstinct. Most ofT

'comes from oug essness,

ig-

’ norance or inherited habit. There is

no justification for taking out ones
' osti ities on innocent wildlife. The -
WW

.rea er mus aug a l e when
reading of the Rev. Price’s descrip-

tion ‘of a hunter: “Being basically

compassionate, they go the second
m: e to spare the animal any
avoidable suffering.” Isn’t the suf-
fering totally avoidable." '
Most peep e are not hunters. They
- know‘little of the facts of hunting and
. often hear only the justifications
. from hunters. It has been stated that
if we had to kill animals for our meal
_,(or witness the slaughterhouse),
,very few of us would eat meat. The

.:hunter takes this one step further. He'

#kills his meal, enerallv r
;.(the..“challen e”), secondarily for
-. food . .

wé humane “non-hunters” realize.

that we cannot “make” another stop
killing. We only hope to present the
facts for those who do not understand
the issues and full truth behind the
.issues. I reiterate:

' (1) Hunting is not a “sport” when
one player is not aware of a contest
and hasn’t the same equipment. The
appreciation of nature, exercise,
fellowship are available to us without
killing animals;

(2) “Game" animal populations
are manipulated by governmental
agencies for hunters precisely be-
cause it brings in huge revenues. This
is not for conservation, but for the
almighty dollar. Hunters boast that
they pay for conservation relying
heavily on the Pittman-Robertson
Act of 1937 which takes excise taxes
on arms and ammunition from the
federal treasury and‘ distributes
them to states, where they are used
for habitat manipulation and training
people to hunt. All of us pay tax
dollars for the US. Dept. of In-
terior’s Game Commission budget.
Billions of tax dollars (not just from
the manufacturing of munitions, or
from the hunters) are used to
purchase national and state parks
and wildlife refuges H

(3) Hunters usually kill the finest
and best, weakening gene pools of the
hunted species (not to mention the
species he has brought to the verge of
extinction in order to raise popu-
lations of “game” animals);

(4) Hunters protest that they eat

ammunition, transportation and time

fringe. In fact, from all the recent
columns (Andy Rooney, “Reducing
cruelty to animals,” and Paul
Harvey, “The ‘noble’ sport offox
hunting”) and letters to the editor of
this newspaper, as well as articles
and TV documentaries, I’d say
there’s a movement “blowin’ in the
wind,” the likes of which have not
been witnessed since the 19605. And it
is time. We who can speak have too
long been silent for those creatures
who cannot.

I am addressing here the question
of needless killing. As long as
markets are full of a variety of meats
for man’s sustenance and shops are
full of nice coats to keep us warm, I’d
say the only explanation for this
needless waste is the enjoyment of
killing itself with total apathy for the
suffering involved. To paraphrase
Paul Harvey, in a civilized society,
blood sports are outdated. And as for
the wearing of furs, well there is
nothing disturbing at the sight of an
Alaskan Indian in seal fur. However,
many of us are as offended by women
in real furs as non-smokers are by
smokers. Let’s hope that this move-
ment can gain that kind of momen-

tum. Fancy cars and jewels can

Bob Barker took a courageous

stand toward this, and would it were
that more men and women of his

a game show called “The Price Is

“game show,” too. I think it should

Price strikes a nerve
EDITOR:

Once again, Dr. Nelson Price in his
article of Feb. 22 in the Marietta
Daily Journal has struck a nerve and,
I believe, warrants a reply.

In his text, he was asking that the
hunters’ right be respected in a very
controversial issue.

I couldn't agree more in respecting
one’s rights to do what they choose to
do: Let their conscience be their
guide. I must, however, point out that
it was Dr. Price’s column on his

' hunting experience in 1985 that

Waunt ﬁlth and status; I?
It is time for action now! Whether

brought about an outcry from anti-
hunters. By all means, do what you
feel is right for you, but keep to
yourself that which would offend
others, and do not write articles
concerning it that we are likely to
read.

Homosexuals protest that they
have their rights, but those of us that
are “straight” find their lifestyles
offensive, and many ministers speak
out daily against them.

Dr. Price’s first paragraph states
that hunting for some helps prevent
hostility. Would it be safe to assume
that these ”same some" are the very
persons that would be wife-beaters,
abusers of their children, and yes,
even murderers, if but not for
reaping their frustrations out on the
innocent animals? Is this the same
person Dr. Price refers to as a
responsible conservationist?

Dr. Price quoted scripture regard-
ing animals and their purpose here J,
don’t know any anti-hunter that

uld not a ree that God ut animals
here for food. Animals were not
rats in ose days, in the abun-
dance they are today, to provide
meat in one’s diet. To quote Peter as
having said “kill and eat" (lest they
ate the animals alive) was merely a
figure of speech.

Not one place in the Bible will you
find it Biblically permissible to use

for “fun and s ort" any animal He
creafﬁ. -

Dr. Price feels the “Wild Game
Banquet” is acceptable and ap-

propriate. Therefore, because he is
in a position to do so, he is imposing

on my rights b conductin in the
Lord’s house that which offends me

Bread and Circus markets in Massa-

only if they are sick. Kleinpeter

said that’s rare. .
Hugh Johnson, a commodities'

Specialist for the American Farm .'
Bureau Federation in Illinois, says

that conventional farm methods
are not likely to be replaced.

“Modern agriculture is also built '

around what consumers will buy."
Johnson says. "ln eggs, consumers
want a certain color yolk, a white
shell. They want white veal. which
is produced by a milk-fed diet."

So far. Kleinpeter's Hollow Road
Farm in rural Columbia County.
about 30 miles south of Albany. is
the only. producer of Rambling Rose
veal.

On a recent morning in his ram-
shackle" barn. Kleinpeter talked
about his philosophy of humane
husbandry as he tended his herd of
about 80 calves. ranging in age from

”Pilate l"

onetozoweeks. ‘ “ 1 "’~‘ "

‘ “We get our calves directly from

the farmer, the morning after

they' re born,” he says. “They' re
much healthier than if we got them
from auction."

Unlike milk-fed calves grown for
white veal Rambling Rose calves
are weaned at eight weeks and put
on a diet of grain and pasture graz-
ing. ‘

Every week. Kleinpeter picks the
four biggest ones, 18 to 22 weeks
old and takes them to a local
slaughterhouse. ~
- , “Factory farms have to move
them out at 16 weeks because they
can’t live any longer under those
circumstances," Kleinpeter says.

’ “I don't really hold big growers
~ to blame. They’re squeezed, too. My
neighbor takes 100 calves to the
slaughterhouse and doesn't get a
price until they’re hanging in the
freezer. They may tell him $1.60 a
pound beforehand, but then the
grader looks" at the carcasses and
maybe says they’ re too pink, so he
only gets $1.30 a pound. ”

Kleinpeter says FACT gives him
a set price of $1.75 a pound for his
veal regardless of color -- which
ranges from milky pink to rosy.

Rambling Rose veal could help
small farms compete in an age of gi-
ant agribusiness, Kleinpeter says.

' However, he says his veal opera-
tion, “which provides about $300
profit a week from four calves, is
too small to support the farm. Klein-
peter and Snyder are building a
flock of dairy-sheep. with plans to
make cheese3and yogurt for the
Manhattan gourmet market.

“There’s going to be more and
more of a market for meat raised
like this," he says. “People are more
and more aware of how animals are
treated. But even more than that.
they're more aware of what's going
into the animals that they' re eating.
And they re also more aware of the
taste of the meat "

' Carlsen feels strongly about the;
mistreatment of animals, as any

' sensitive person might, and then
‘ goes on and identifies the eating of
, animals, the wearing of their skins,

or experimenting with them as part:
of medical research, as equal parts

‘ of mistreatment. He goes further

and says that we tolerate this
behavior because of our "unscien-
tific" belief that “God gave them to

our behavior, and not just in rela-
tion to animals. He refers to such
beliefs as “mind-boggling distor~.
tions." Apparently. since he is not

‘ subject to unscientific beliefs, and:
thus not at the mercy of mind-bog- '

 

 

gling distortions. he can see more -

clearly than most.

What Carlsen. and others like
him, fail to see is that mistreatment
of animals, where it exists. will not
be stopped by trying to convince
people that we are just animals
ourselves. It is precisely because

Lizard causes
; developers to
§ scale back plans

By Alan Van Zelfden
OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

 

COACHELLA VALLEY, Calif.
—— Just three. inches long, the
Coachella Valley lizard has be-

come a formidable foe for .big‘

business.

Seven years ago, the reptile
brought construction. to a halt in
this desert‘valley just east of
Palm Springs, while environmen—
talists and developers debated the
creature’s future. At issue was the
lizard’s sandy lair, which
sprawled across a desert wash
and dunes valued at more than
$19 billion by developers who
had plans to build resorts for the
rich.

The small fringe- toed lizard‘.

that silenced the bulldozers drew
its strength from its weakness:
Since 1980 it has been listed by
the federal government as a

‘ threatened species.

Several years and countless
threatened lawsuits later, environ—
mentalists and developers agreed
to a compromise that stands as a

' model in Californias efforts to
preserve its desert lands: Devel- ‘
opment would continue in the l
valley, but only if 13,000 acres

‘f state.

 

“This is by far the most visible
and complicated environmental
victory in the California desert,”
says Cameron Barrows, a soft-

2..spoken naturalist who manages

the lizard’s palm-shaded preserve
10 miles east of Palm Springs.
“We hope this will be the
template of what will happen to
environmentally endangered land
in the future.”

Developers had been been busy

. transforming the sandy land at
the foothills to the San Bernardi-

no Mountains into resorts ever
since the ﬁrst hotels went up here
during the 19503. Just when bull-

, dozers appeared ready to turn the
‘ li'zard’s home into golf courses

and hotels, the federal govern-

‘ment placed the reptile on its

threatened species list.
“Local environmentalists were
making noises like they were go—

ing to shut development down in

the entire valley. That made de-
velopers extremely upset. They
were just butting heads,” said
Barrows of The Nature Conser—
vancy, a national environmental
organization that helped to settle

the issue.

In a moment of desperation,
developers threatened to chal-
lenge the federal law that protect-
ed the lizard and thousands of
other endangered species of wild
life across the country. It was a
bluff that led to a settlement.

Realizing they had more to gain
through compromise than con—
frontation, local activists asked
for help from the Conservancy, '
an organization whose amiable re—
lationship with business has
worked wonders in "buying lands
inhabited by endangered species.

The Conservancy immediately
purchased $2 million of land in
what is now the heart of the
13,000-acre preserve. The organi-
zation then marshaled ﬁnancial
help from two federal agencies
and a state agency to purchase
some of the remaining land cru~
cial to the reptile’s futu1e.

watched atten-

tively as the

spry little toy
poodle bounced
proudly into one of
the recreational
rooms of The West-
bury Place, a Hous-
ton area convales- ..
cent-nursing home.

The transforma-
tion that occurred among the resi-
dents was one of the most heart-
warming experiences I’ve ever
had, as their somewhat “blank”
expressions quickly turned to joy—
fulness. The dozen or more senior
adults in the room turned their
undivided attention toward the
composed toy poodle.

“Oh! there’s Mitzi, hi Mitzi,
nice Mitzi, come to me Mitzi,
you’re early today,” the residents
exclaimed. The skillful Mitzi
moved methodically and patiently
from one individual to the next as
if she were a medical professional
making daily rounds. She seemed
to understand exactly the amount
of time required to please each
person. Occasionally a resident
desired to cuddle Mitzi longer
than the others. With obvious pa-
tience and compassion, this little
dog would respond. Her perfor-
mance was absolutely beautiful.

Mitzi is a dedicated profession-
al pet therapist as those she visits
always seem to profit. When a
new resident is admitted, Mitzi is
part of the welcoming committee
or when a resident feels de—
pressed, Mitzi will sit on their lap

physrcal or mental problems do
not affect her devotion for anV--
one. Integrating Mitzi into the ac—
tiv1t1es program at Westbury
Place was the idea of activities db
rector Trudy Hunter.

Prior to being transferred to
Houston in 1983, Trudy had
demonstrated in another conva-
lescent facility the significant val-
ue of. integrating pets into patient
actrvzties —-— not just pets on a
weekly or monthiy visitation but
on a fuil~time basis. Span after

gloom. It was loveat first sight.
The bedraggled pooch was called

“Mitzi”. Her previous owners had
relocated to another city and their
plans didn’t include M1tzr. She
was emaciated, not in the best of
health and, obviously, had been

. neglected.

Mitzi had been at the SPCA for

seVeral days and her future ap—
as no one seemed

interested in adopting her. Trudy
Hunter departed from the SPCA
on that day with Mitzi in her arms
and a companionship began
which, today, is the epitome of

human-animal bonding.

Trudy’s schedule at Westbury
Place often begins early and ends
late; but she is never alone as Mit-
zi is always there. When the day‘s

work is over, Trudy and Mitzi go
home together and spend the
evening in a family environment
which also includes another pet,
an Alaskan malamute. Interest-
ingly, Mitzi is not as subdued at
home as she is at Westbury Place.
She runs and plays with her mala-
mute friend and other family
members. As Mitzi, Trudy, and l ‘
continued to visit the various
wings of Westbury Place; resi-
dents would continue to greet
Mitzi withunrestricted enthusi-
asm. Mitzi was always the first to
~ be greeted while Trudy had to
wait her turn to be acknowledged.
One occasional complaint
about having a full-time mascot in
a convalescent center is that the
problems generated by a pet
overshadow the benefits. This is
certainly not true with Mitzi. Oc-
casionally, she barks and chases
the birds in the courtyard; howev-
er, this is considered by most resi-
dents as amusing, especially since
she never catches a bird. The big-
gest problem Trudy experiences
with Mitzi is trying to prevent the

Mitzi pauses for a visit with Marguerite Zebeau, a resident
of The Westbury Place.

Tribune Staff Writer

“We wouldn’t do anything to de-
preciate our property,” she added.
.“I ask you, does that pretty home
‘ . look like an eyesore?”

SUN CITY CENTER — Green Briar was just an- ‘
other quiet, neatly manicured neighborhood in this
retirement colony where folks hum old show tunes
while driving trendy golf carts to shuffleboard
games.

Until the Martins moved in.

The purple martins, that is, a gregarious gaggle
of birds who prefer the communal living popular
during the ’605 to the costly single-family housing
common in Sun City Center.

The martins’ free-loving ways aren’t sitting too
well with some residents and the community’s devel-
oper, who has threatened legal action against the
couple who erected a home for the birds.

“I’m perplexed,” said Beatrice Parker, who is
acting as the birds’ hostess during their Florida stay.
“I just don’t understand why these people don’t like ‘
the martins. They’re very beneficial to the environ-
ment and they’re very beautiful on top of that.”

But it’s not the martins themselves, insists Sun-
mark Communities Corp., the neighborhood’ 5 devel-
oper. It’s that the martins’ home, perched atop a
pole 20 feet high, doesn’t blend well with the other
homes in Green Briar.

“That’s not a birdhouse, that’s a bird high-rise,”
said Sunmark spokeswoman Anne Sessums. “A pur-
ple martin house is a different kind of structure.
You don’t hang it on a tree like other birdhouses.
The thing sits up on pole.

“This isn’t so much a house as multifamily hous-
ing,” Sessums concluded.

 

 

 

 

. Parker and her husband, Earl, a

retired research chemist, moved to Sunmark had not1f1ed1ts attorney or

their new home in March from an-
other section of Sun City Center and
put up the martins’ house shortly af-
ter.

The martins’ house is about 2
feet tall and 18 inches long with 28
compartments for nesting couples.
The Parkers painted it white with
blue trim — just like their home on
Wolf Laurel Drive.

“We put it up in the morning
and in the afternoon the martins
were swarming around it and mov-
ing in,” said Earl Parker. “They ob-
viously needed a home.”

Six days after the house was
erected, the Parkers received a let-
ter from Sunmark saying the struc-
ture was in violation of deed restric-
tions enforced by Sunmark and the
local property owners association.

The letter requested that the Park-'

as pull down the house within 30
days. When the Parkers failed to do
so, another letter arrived saying

the problem.

The Parkers said they won’t '

turn the martins out and are pre-
pared to go to court over the mat-
ter. One expert said state law,
which prohibits doing harm to nest-
ing birds, is probably on the Park-

ers’ side.

“It would be hard to see how

they could take it down while the

birds are nesting in it without harm-
ing them,” said Dr. Bernie Yokel,

president of the Florida Audubon

Society. “It seems to me that would

be harassment of the nest."

T . The martins living near the
Parkers are probably up from Mexi-

'co to spend the summer in Florida,

Yokel said. .
One of their chief benefits to the

environment, Yokel said, is a diet

that reads like an inventory of the
insect world: ants, bees, wasps, spi-
ders and dragonflies (a particular

. favorite).

Even Fritz’s own yard was once a
battleground. His house» can’t be
seen from the road. But everyone
knows it's here. The neighbors used
to protest that his high grasses bred
chiggers and his weeds gave off un-
desirable pollens.

“They’ll still complain about it,”
says longtime neighbor Steve Con-
dos, “but we ’ve all kind of just de-
cided to put up with Ned." l. .

In 1972, the city tried to make
Fritz mow his weeds. ,He went to
court. . 1 - "

Fritz’s defense was that weeds
are plants no one values, but he val-
ues every single plant in his yard.

He won.

To him, this yard is the “web of
life,” a small patch of "natural dio
versity,” two words Fritz invokes
like a Christian conjuring up the
cross for a congregation of sinners.

Without natural diversity, hu-
manity will lose the flexibility it
needs to survive, he says. His desire
to preserve nature goes beyond
aesthetics. He considers himself a
fighter in a desperate cause: the
cause of human survival.

Move through the wall of woods
around his driveway. Step around
the pile of newspapers waiting to go
to the recycling plant. Skirt the two
brush piles that belong to the
white-throated sparrows. Pull the
string under the woodpecker door-

will knock loud enough to an-
nounce you. _ ' :

The man who answers is the
“stubbornest man who ever lived in
the history of this world, ” accord-
ing to environmental activist Pat
Paralies. , .

Fit, slightly built, Fritz doesn’t
look stubborn at all. He’s obliging,
good natured, dryly humorous.

“I’ m learning to get along with
people," he says.

Fritz admits that he likes to ar-
gue. 'l‘here’ s no point in always talk-
ing to people who agree, he says.

Some of his old opponents are so
tired of his arguments that they
won’t publicly debate him anymore,

But the strands of hair left on his

time as a fiery young Jaycee and

errant waves, sometimes sprouting
in their own independent direc-
tions, the hair on Fritz’ 3 head still
holds a bit of red.

Pat Paralies first became ac-
quainted with Fritz and his volun-
teer efforts when she called to ask
if she could be of any help in saving
natural environments.

“He laughed and said he thought
he could find me something to do,”
she says. Eleven years later, she

says, “He will work you into the =

ness areas in Texas.

“We would be sitting in the camp
with an inch of ice on our tents, and
Ned thought that was perfectly ordi-
nary behavior because this was im-
portant and we needed to know
where a given tree was.”

Fritz’s next campaign will be a
national movement against clear
cutting, a widespread forestry prac-
tice in which all the trees in an area
are cut and the land is replanted
with one type of tree. The tech-
nique, Fritz says, destroys the natu-
ral diversity of an area.

But as much as he opposes clear
cutting, Fritz won t chain himself to
trees to stop it. He works in the sys-
tem, no matter how long it takes.

Ned Fritz’s home resembles a miniature nature preserve.

Local naturalist
fights defiantly
for ‘web of life’

By Christine Wicker
Suﬁ Writer of The News

Marooned in a million-dollar North
Dallas neighborhood, environmentalist
Ned Fritz gives nature her way. She takes
it and emerges in his three-acre yard,
messy, erratic and wild.

In payment, cedar elms cool his house.
A tufted titmouse entertains him. Tree
squirrels do his gardening. _

The pulse of nature beats around him
unchecked, fluttering, but fragile. Fritz
hears it. Day and night, night and day, he
works to keep nature working.

Genie, his wife of 43 years, often awak-
ens after midnight to see his place in bed
empty. She finds him in the living room
scribbling some note that may go out to-
morrow in one of the five to six dozen
personal letters he sends each month to
members of Congress, naturalists and bu-
reaucrats around the country.

Most days the 71-year-old retired law-
yer sits, bird watcher’s binoculars beside
him, in front of the windows at the back
of his house, laboring over a half-dozen
piles of papers that represent his current
projects.

Without Ned ’s activism, no Texas envi-
ronmental legislation would have passed
the state Legislature or the us. Congress
in the last two decades, says Rep. John
Bryant, D-Dallas, who supports many of
the bills Fritz likes.

“He's the most significant environ-
mental figure in our state’s history and
will remain that, most likely. I doubt that
we’re going to see his equal,” Bryant says.

Ned is less reticent.

“They think everybody ought to take
their word as experts and let them go on)?
he says in a tone that indicates that’s
about as likely as a rebirth of the dodo

For more than 20 years, Fritz has been
working his way into the forestry ser-
vice’s territory as slowly and surely as an
oak root pushing through a concrete side-
walk.

Just as Fritz has won more and more
territory in his battle against the destruc-

.Black-footed ferret study. Intensive
surveys are under way in northern
Arizona to determine if the state has any
isolated, surviving populations or if there
is reasonable potential to reintroduce
ferrets to that area.

The ferrets, a member of the weasel
family, were wiped out during poisoning
campaigns directed at prairie dogs -— the
ferret’s primary food source. Believed to
be extinct as recently as the late 19705,
only a small remnant population exists in
Wyoming. Game ofﬁcials hope some of
those ferrets can be reintroduced to
Arizona. '

The center provides care for injured,
orphaned and other wildlife temporarily
in the custody of the Game and Fish
Department. It is located on the grounds
of the Adobe Mountain Juvenile Institute
at Pinnacle Peak Road and the Black
Canyon Freevvay. In addition to providing
care for wildlife, the center helps in the
rehabilitation of juveniles being detained
at Adobe Mountain.

More than 80 volunteers assist with
wildlife pickup and feeding and caring for
the animals. More than a dozen veteri-
nary clinics donate their time and services
to the center. .

The center’s most significant accom-
plishment is in returning many species to
the wild. About 60 percent of the birds
and mammals brought to the center are
successfully treated and returned to their
natural habitat. '

. From tiny little mice to the majestic
bald eagle, Arizona has its share of
endangered wildlife. ‘

_ ‘ And conservationists say it’s largely the
responsibility of citizens to ensure protec~
tion for the state’s disappearing ﬁsh,
reptiles, birds and mammals
.. .“The most important thing people can
do is to have a general ethic about.
wildlife, a concern about keeping it
around,” Rich Glinski, a non-game biolo:
gist with the Arizona Game and Fish
Department, said.

"That concern can extend from check-
ing the donation box on your state tax
returns, to supporting organizations de-
voted to protecting wildife and their
habitats, to letting your congressman
know that you care about wildlife.”

The department’s budget for addressing
vanishing wildlife this year is roughly
$500,000. Arizona residents contributed
half of that by noting donations of varied
amounts on their 1985 state income tax
=-returns. ' ' -

Glinski said Arizona’s wildlife protec-
tion budget is "not as good as some states,
and better than others. You never have
enoug 3’

States such as Minnesota, Missouri and
Florida have conservation budgets in
excess of $1 million, Glinski said.

_ With what Arizona does have, wildlife
officials are able to work actively with
about half the state’s endangered species.

"We have 93 different species on our
endangered species list, and without those
voluntary donations, we wouldn’t be able
to have the conservation program we’ve
got,” said Terry Johnson, who supervises
the non-game branch of the Game and
Fish Department.

some. of the state’s endangered wildlife
include the bald and golden eagles, great
horned owl, roadrunner, brown pelican,

i javelina, bobcat, coyote, mule and white-

tail deer, raccoons, gray fox, black bear,

: desert tortoise, gopher snake and the Gila

monster.
Eighteen of
animals also are listed as endangered by
the federal government. They include the
humpback chub, Gila tapminnow, Sono-

ran pronghorn antelope, peregrine falcon,

the masked bobwhite and the Yuma
clapper rail. -

Johnson said some of the wildlife are
under study to determine their potential
for total extinction and ways to prevent it.
Others are being introduced to habitats
from which they’ve long been absent.

The state’s most recent reintroduction
effort has been an attempt to adapt
thick-billed parrots to the Chiricahua
Mountains in southeastern Arizona,
where they lived until the early 1900s.

They are the only species of parrot,
other than the extinct Carolina parakeet,
that ever has been native to the continen-

tal United States In the wild, they can be -

found only in the pine-forested mountains
of Mexico, where they are truly endan-
gered. .
Game ofﬁcials acquired some that were
confiscated from Mexican smugglers, as
well as some bred in captivity. They began
last fall releasing small ﬂocks into the
mountains. .
,. “We’ve let 29 go so far,” Johnson said.
They’re banded, and we’ve put radio
collars on some of them. This particular
protect- will continue for at least the next
four years.” ‘ . -

reintroduced to its former Arizona habitat

is the Colorado River Squawfish. The
world’s largest minnow, reaching up to 6
feet in length and weighing as much as

‘ 100 pounds, the squawﬁsh once swam the

Colorado River and its main tributaries,

the “ state’s endangered ' t, - Sonoran river otters were reintroduced

to, the upper Verde River three years ago.
Johnson said it has been difﬁcult to keep
track of them, but wildlife officials have
seen evidence that the otters are surviv-
ing, and probably beginning to breed.

Wildlife conservation efforts take other
directions as well, from studies to public
education to breeding programs. Some of
the more interesting programs now under
way include: -

I Southwestern Bald Eagle Nest
Watch program. The department trains

5 teams of two people to keep a 24-hour,

seven-day vigil over bald eagle nests. Not
only do they record the birds’ activities,
they also warn intruders -— such as hikers
and campers — of the proximity of the -

Johnson said this year, for the first

3' time, Indians on the San Carlos and Fort ‘

McDowell reservations have become in-
volved in the program. 'Next year, three
nests on the reservations will be watched

by Indian teams.

Only 23 pairs of breeding Southern bald

-' eagles are known in the Southwest, and
i all of them live in Arizona. They are listed
as endangered by both the state and
‘ federal governments.

Many of those nests were discovered
through the department’s nest location

Right to patent animal life
should be debated, limited

Shauld humans play God by creating new
forms of animals and patenting their life forms
as merchandise?

Not without lots of debate followed by
limits.

The US. Patent and Trademark office has
taken the first step by saying it would allow
inventors; to patent new forms of animal life.
A process for altering genetic patterns should
be owned and rewarded But there should be
restrictions on what changes can be made, es-
pecially as science learns totinx and manipu-

late the higher forms {ﬁlife

Any new technology can turn out to be

_ more helpful and less harmful than doomééy-
. gers claim when those technologies are intro-
" i'tluced. For example, a General Electric engii» '
’rneer genetically modified some bacteria so it

would eat oil slicks. Mendy eater to have
around at a time humans are messing up rivers
and oceans But it also 15 true that some tech-

?rnologies —-even beneficial ones — have been

destructively used.

"The scientists who approve of genetic pat-
enting point out that peeple already are chang-
ing some species, by the breeding of horses or
farm animals, for example. Gene-splicing
w’ork might do the same thing faster. For
thousands of years farmers also have been cre-
ating mules by mating horses and donkeys.
and they haven’t hurt anything. Great bota-
nists such as Luther Burbank have created bet-
ter. plants by grafting different types together.
Scientists say fears of monster-makin g are un-

pgtounded, for the mutations would have to ben-

ways to remove genetic defects from humans
in the womb -— a merciful, good work, as far
as it goes. Meanwhile, an agricultural re-
searcher has stuck a human-growth gene into
pig embryos in an attempt to breed swine with
leaner meat. The fast-growing pigs have been
able to pass that code on to offspring, who also
happen to be crippled. It may be that the need
for a balanced, harmonious set of genes will
prevent cross-breeding between species, but if -
the human genetic code can be altered and if
researchers are mixing human and pig gene
patterns now, what else could they do in de-
cades ahead? Should mankind be permitted to
introduce entirely new traits to a species, as
Opposed to enhancing'the traits they already
have?

Human intelligence has made life better by
redirecting nature’s parts and forces, produc-
ing stronger animals and hardier crops. But ~
humankind does not yet understand all the
laws that keep the balance in nature, and hu-
mans have broken many laws they do under-
stand. So Caution is the best door through
which to enter this brave, new world.

Ethics

 

 

 

Should'Animals Be Patented?

 

A new policy stirs more debate over biotechnology

he ﬁrst US. patent law, passed in

1790, protected the invention of “any
useful art, manufacture, engine, machine
or device, or any improvement thereon
not before known or used.” But are items
of manufacture necessarily inanimate?
Apparently not. In 1930, Congress voted
to approve the patenting of new plants
produced by grafts, cuttings or other asex-
ual methods. Half a century later the Su-
preme Court went even further and ruled
that the law would apply to genetically
engineered micro-organisms, such as a
new strain of bacteria designed to gobble
up oil spills. In the View of the court, “any-
thing under the sun that is made by man”
could be patented.

Now the US. Patent and Trademark
Ofﬁce has taken what seems to be the
~ next logical step. It announced this month
that it “considers non—naturally occurring
nonhuman multicellular living organ-
isms, including animals, to be patentable
subject matter.”

That decision was regarded by the
.Patent Oﬂ‘ice simply as an incremental
move to keep abreast of advances in bio-
technology. But to some people it marked
the crossing of a sacrosanct dividing line
and was cause for alarm. Patenting plants
and microbes are one thing, said Veteri-
narian Michael Fox, scientiﬁc director of
the Humane Society of the United States,
because “they lack the capacity to suffer.”
By viewing animals as mere products, he
continued, “we seem to be forgetting that
these are sentient beings.”

Animal-rights advocates were not
alone in their opposition. Others feared
that the new policy might enable biotech-
nology companies to take control of the
livestock industry, squeezing out small-
time breeders and reducing the genetic di-
versity of farm animals. “With patents,
you raise the question of who owns or con-
trols the breeding of livestock,” said Cary
Fowler, program director of the Rural
Advancement Fund, an advocacy group
for family farmers. “Certain companies
could in effect control the market.”

Some theologians decried the appar-
ent equation of God’s creatures with man-
ufactured goods. Others were afraid that
the patenting of genetically altered human
beings might be next, despite the fact that
the Patent Ofﬁce statement clearly speci-
ﬁed “nonhuman” life. “My fear is that we
will begin valuing human beings as no dif-
ferent from animals,” said J. Robert Nel-
son, director of the Institute of Religion at
Texas Medical Center in Houston.

The new patent controversy is just the
latest in a series of ethical battles over bio—
technology, the science that enables man
to manipulate the genetic code. The best-

 

known and most controversial technique
used by biotechnology is gene-splicing,
the insertion of foreign genes into plants,
animals or microbes. Scientists have, for
example, introduced rat-growth-hormone
genes into the DNA of mice, resulting in
larger mice, and ﬁreﬂy genes into tobacco
plants, which then glow in the dark. Ge-

netic engineering cannot, however,
“cross” a cow with a frog to produce a new
species. “The essence of a particular ani-
mal is something you don’t change,” ex-
plains Thomas Wagner, director of Ohio
University’s Edison Animal Biotechnolo-
gy Center in Athens, Ohio. “A pig is a pig,
and a cow is a cow. You merely enhance
certain aspects of it.”

While some critics of biotechnology
cite it as an attempt by man to play God,
most scientists View it as merely the latest
example of man playing man, exploiting
nature as he always has. “A dairy cow was
not put on this earth to produce milk for
humans,” Wagner says. “It was put here
to make more cows. We just adapted them
to our needs.” Harvard Microbiologist

 

Bernard Davis agrees. “Genetic engineer-
ing in animals is simply an extension of
domestication,” he says. “Of all the tech-
nologies that man has developed, domes-
tication probably has the best record of
enormous beneﬁts to human beings and
no hazards.”

Davis claims that laymen tend to ex-
aggerate the power, and hence the poten-
tial danger, of genetic engineering, partic—
ularly when it is applied to animals.
“While we can change DNA at will in the
test tube, we can’t change the animals,”
he says, simply because their genetics is so
complex. Consequently, Davis concludes,
“we won’t be making creatures with four
legs and wings.” ~

Indeed, the goals of most genetic engi-
neers are far more modest: leaner pigs,
dairy - cows that produce more milk,
chickens that are resistant to infection
and thus can be raised with fewer antibi-
otics. Though the Patent Ofﬁce says it has
about 15 applications for patents on ge-
netically altered animals, important
changes like these are probably ten years
away from the farmyard. Says Wagner:
“We need to breed, test and evaluate them
in an agricultural setting.”

The difﬁculties of this process were
apparent in one experiment conducted at
the Department of Agriculture’s research
center in Beltsville, Md. DOA scientists
tried to produce a leaner pig by endowing'
it with a human-growth-hormone gene.
The resulting animal indeed had less fat.
but it suffered from some unexpected
physical problems, including crossed eyes
and arthritis.

While animal-rights advocates con-
cede that conventional animal breeding
has produced sickly misﬁts, they fear that
genetic engineering will inﬂict greater
suffering and disability. “Researchers are
creating new disease complexes that I
certainly couldn’t treat,” says Veterinari-
an Fox. He objects to another area of ge-
netic engineering: the development of an-
imals that suffer from human diseases like
muscular dystrophy. Yet such creatures
would be invaluable in testing new drugs
for humans.

The Humane Society, eleven other an~
imal-welfare groups and the Foundation
on Economic Trends (which consists
largely of Jeremy Rifkin, an implacable
foe of genetic engineering) have petitioned
the Patent Ofﬁce to rescind its new policy.
Such a reversal is unlikely. The agency’s
role is to encourage innovation, not to de-
termine its ethical implications. That is
the business of the Biomedical Ethics
Board, which was established by Congress.
in 1985 but has not yet met. The board’s
deliberations are long overdue, says John
Fletcher, chief of the bioethical program
at the National Institutes of Health: “Our
society is starved for creative debate on
these questions.” ——By Claudia Wallis.

IDEAS

 

 

 

Should Man
Make Beast?

A new ethical dilemma

 

 

s a symbol of biology’s moral and ethi-

cal frontier, the geep hardly cuts an

impressive ﬁgure. But there it stands,
with a goat’s head and long neck and a
sheep’s bushy wool coat above knobby
knees. Biologists at the University of Cali-
fornia at Davis can make one of these odd
creatures by fusing a sheep and a goat
embryo in a test tube, then implanting the
fused embryo in a goat’s womb. A geep is a
sterile hybrid and not much of a farm
animal. As a scientiﬁc feat, however, it is
now on center stage, along with a small
number of similarly novel life forms creat-
ed through modern techniques like em-
bryo fusion and genetic engineering. The
reason: the US Patent and Trademark
Ofﬁce took notice of them and set off a
complex scientiﬁc and ethical debate
when it recently became the ﬁrst in the
world to agree to consider applications for
patents on new animal varieties, just as if
these beings were mere buckets of bolts.

They aren’t, of course: they breathe, eat
and have eyes that can stare back at you in
a most unsettling way. Indeed, the notion
that scientists have ofﬁcial sanction to cre-
ate ‘and patent new animal forms raises
troubling questions for many. A coalition
of 12 groups, including the Humane Soci-
ety and the American Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals, is lobbying
Congress to narrow the patent law and
exclude animals from its purview. Among
other things, the critics charge that the
patents will encourage cruel animal ex-
periments, wipe out small farmers who
can’t afford genetically souped-up live-
stock and—most sensationally—lead to a
Brave New World in which people hold
patents on other people. To Jeremy Rifkin,
director of the Foundation on Economic
Trends and an outspoken critic of bioengi-
neering, the Patent Ofﬁce was not only
encouraging scientists "to play God” but
audaciously assuming it had the right to
grant that power. "Who are these people to
redeﬁne life as no different than a toaster
or a tennis ball?” he asked.

Welcome action: To others, the decision was
long overdue. In 1980 the Supreme Court,
capping an eight-year legal ﬁght, ruled
that Ananda M. Chakrabarty, a General
Electric microbiologist, could obtain a pat-
ent on a novel strain of bacteria; he had
endowed the bacteria with genes from oth-

er species, enabling the bugs to digest oil
and clean up marine spills. At the time
neither the court nor the Patent Ofﬁce
extended the ruling. to cover animals. But
the ability of scientists to transplant for-
eign genes into animal embryos has grown
more sophisticated, and now the Patent
Ofﬁce has decided that the court’s ruling
does apply to creatures besides bacteria.
As patent commissioner Donald J. Quigg
announced, "nonnaturally occurring non-
human multiCellular living organisms, in-
cluding animals” are patentable.

What about us, though? Ethicists are
worried about what they see as a slippery
slope that could lead to strange experi-
ments on people: today it’s geeps, tomorrow
it’s peeps. J. Robert Nelson, director of the
Institute of Religion at the TexasMedical
Center, said the new policy “removes one
more barrier to the protection of human
life.’ ’ But to believe that the patent decision
by itself will make this happen is to misun-
derstand patents. They are meant to protect
inventions, not to evaluate whether the in-
ventions are ethical or safe. Regarding hu-
man life, the government already prohibits
laboratories that receive federal funds
from experimenting on human embryos. In
addition, the constitutional amendment

 

against slavery prohibits treat-
ing persons as property, making
it illegal, patent attorneys say,
for one person to hold a patent
on another.

What the animal-patent de-
cision will do is speed up re-
search on genetic manipula~
tion of animals—for good and
bad. Not surprisingly, industri-
al scientists applaud the new
policy. Richard Godown, presi-
dent of the Industrial Biotech-
nology Association, says the de-
cision "supplies a much-needed
missing piece that eventually
will have widespread economic
impact.” But critics charge that

as more researchers get involved in animal
research, hoping to score a valuable patent,
more animals will suffer. This is a valid
concern. At the Agricultural Research sta-
tion in Maryland, researchers transplant-
ed a human growth-hormone gene into pig
embryos; the pigs are much larger than
normal and may someday produce more
pork for the dollar as researchers expect,
but they are also cross-eyed, arthritic and
prone to infections. John Kullberg, presi-
dent of the ASPCA, says the decision is a
“proﬁt-motive inducement to strip away
some of the safeguards against cruelty that ‘
are already in place.”

In coming months the patent controver-
sy will join what one scientist calls the
“storm over biology”—-the public’s concern
about the effects of genetic engineering.
The scientiﬁc methods that are used to
create patentable animals are increasingly
well worked out. The still unsolved ques-'
tions that need answering are mainly ethi-
cal: How will we care for these bizarre farm
animals? Why are we creating them? If the ,
Patent Oﬂice can be faulted for one thing, it
is haste: its policy should have been set only
after a thorough public debate.

Brinster emphasized that much
of the genetic engineering in ani-
mals was being done to try to solve
. human scourges, such as cancer
‘ and hemophilia.

El

Representatives of some taming
organizations agree that the re-
search will lead to more efficien
food production. -

If the research is successful, for
example, “it will require fewer
cows to produce the same amount
. of milk, thereby reducing the cost
of production,” said Keith Allen, di-

 

rector of marketing for the Miss;

‘ouri Farm Bureau Federation. The
lower costs will be passed on to ’
I~ consumers, he said.

Gene Marti, vice president of ad-
ministration at Mid-America Dairy-
men, Inc., said the research would
not lead to the demise of the small
and mid-sized farms.

“The smaller farmer can af— '

ford a growth hormone just well as
a large farmer,” Marti said. Mid-
America Dairymen is in Spring-
field, Mo., and markets products
for 11,000 members.

But Kim Brown of the National
Farmers Union in Minneapolis said
a review of the US. Patent Act
might be needed. She said the new

policy “has broad implications be- .

yond mere profit,” including ethics.
One expert in veterinary medi-
cine has strong doubts about the

‘ ethics of the research — Michael

Fox, scientific director of the Hu-
mane Society of the United States.
“We’re concerned that there will
be a lot of suffering from putting
human growth hormone genes into
pig embryos,” Fox said. “‘What has
happened is that the pigs have sur-

vived and grown, but they are ar— -

thritic and lethargic.”

In addition, he said, “Now that
we can change genes in animal spe-
cies, we have the potential for mass
exploration for genetic engineering
in animals —— genetic engineers will
be assuming dominion over God for
human ends.” '

The Foundation on Economic
Trends also opposes the patent poli-

board to rescind it, said Jeremy
Rifkin, the foundation’s president.
If the board refuses, Rifkin said,

he and a coalition he is forming — ‘

its members will be agricultural
and animal-rights groups — will
lobby Congress to change the Pat-
ent Act.

“In one stroke, this agency
has redefined biology and life, so
that it is on the same level as elec-
tric toasters, automobiles and ten-
nis balls,” he said. -

The Rev. Dennis Brodeur, direc-
tor of health care ethics for the
order of the Sisters of St. Mary in
St. Louis, said the ethics of owning
a life form shOuld be studied. He
said the primary issue was “what
kind of respect individuals ought to
have for the animal world.”

he said. “Many scientists believe .
the development of new knowledge '_
is a morally neutral issue and only .

:those who use it —— like consumers T

—— have an ethical problem,” Bro-
deur said. .
Stanford’s Berg said society
needed a watchdog group to keep ,

an eye on the work.

“ We need a mechanism to moni-
tor the growth of this research and
to draw up guidelines,” Berg said.
Without reasonable guides, he said,
the courts, the researchers and “ev-
eryone else is operating in a
vacuum.” .

The first step to fill that vacuum

was taken by Congress last year
with the formation of the Congres-

sional Biomedical Ethics Board. A
law setting up the board was passed.
after hearings were held by Sen.
Albert Gore, D-Tenn.

Genetic engineering was one of
several topics discussed at the
hearings, which covered many
moral issues stemming from
technology. . '

The law requires that a Bio-

Congressional board. When the
committee is established .next
month, it will include scientists,
medical clinicians, attorneys, ethi-
cists and two citizen-members.

Gore said, “The nation must

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - May 1, 1987

 

Patent OK
Rekindles .
Hot Debate

By Roger Signor
and Kathryn Rogers
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

DECISION to patent new
animal life forms developed
by new technology, such as

genetic engineering, has rekindled
a fierce debate about ethical and
environmental issues.

Proponents say genetic research
can be a boon to medicine and agri-
culture. Such research can lead to
disease prevention and the devel-
opment of “super animals” that will
make food production more effi-
cient, they say.

:But critics argue that the re-
search is cruel and that it inter-
feres with the integrity 0f animal
species. Also, awarding patents to
large companies that can afford to
do the research will squeeze out the
small- and mid-sized farmers who
could not pay for expensive patent-
ed products, critics say. ,

They also believe that a continu-
ation of experiments in gene alter-
ation could be harmful to all life.

Even a Nobel laureate who was a
founder of gene-splicing says scien-
tists tend to 'be overly optimistic
about the safety of inserting foreign.
genes into animals. The scientist —
Paul Berg, professor of biochemis-
try at Stanford University in Stan-
ford, Calif. —- recently asked for an
international meeting to review is- ’

sues posed by the research.

Berg shared the Nobel Prize in
1980 for being one of the first to
devise laboratory techniques to do
gene splicing. “I don’t have a clear-
er‘ idea of the implications of this
work than anyone else,” he said in
a telephone interview last week.

“Some people have unfound-
ed fears, others have well-founded
concerns," he said. But Berg and
most scientists are strongly op- ;
posed to those who seek to halt the ’
transplanting of genes into animals
to produce rapidly growing strains
of lifestock. These “gene-farming” «1:.

experiments are designed to devel-és "-

op larger superior livestock in half '
the time it would take through stan-
dard breeding.

 

The issue heated up last menth, ’

when the U.S. Patent and Trade Of-
. fice decided that it would patent
. new animal forms devised by gene-
. splicing. The policy bars the patent-

ing of the genetic characteristics of

humans.

The new policy stems from a de-
cision in 1980 by the US. Supreme

,_ Court, which allowed the patenting

of a genetically engineered bacteri-
um developed to eat crude oil. The
court said the original intent be-
hind the patent laws was to have
them include “anything under the

‘ sun that is made by man.” The bac-
:terium never was developed
. commercially.

In deciding an unrelated case
earlier this month, the Patent Of-

; fice’s appellate board said tlie rul-

ing from 1980 meant animal life

' forms cbuld be patented. About 15 .
_ patent applications on modified an- _

imal strains are pending. Details

about them are confidential, a

spokesman for the Patent Office

said.

The policy has ignited debate on
the ethics and safety of gene-splic-
ing as it relates to animals. Some
critics say the animal research
should be stopped altogether.

Scientists find such a position
unacceptable in a free society,
Berg said. He said the research
would continue here or abroad, de-
spite any demands for a freeze.

Berg and other researchers say
also that companies are entitled to

.. patents when they have invested in

research that developed new ani- ‘

mal forms.

,The only “rational alternative to
demands by extremists,” he said, is
establishment of a neutral group to
set guidelines for the research.

The research involves splicing,
or recombining of a cell’s genetic
material — deoxyribonucleic acid,
or DNA -— into a different type of
cell. Scientists call this splicing “re-
combinant DNA technology.”

By using the technique,'scientists
have developed genetically altered
strains of bacteria to- produce hu-
man growth hormone — ' strains

that are now being used to treat '

children who don’t grow normally

because of defective pituitary

glands.

Another line of research involves .
the insertion of genes linked to seri- ‘
ous disease into animals. By giving ;
the animals these diseases, scien»

tists hope to understand what trig-

gers them in humans. Almost all of ,
this work has involved the use of ‘

laboratory rodents: _¥

_ D -
In interviews last week, ethi- “

' cists and activists for environmen- "

tal concerns and animal rights
questioned the patent policy and

-

gene-splicing. They say that:

I No one has the right to own,
patent and commercialize an ani-;
mal life form; some say that prac-
tice is the equivalent of “playing
God.”

I Transplanting genes from one
kind of animal to another inter-
feres with “the integrity of the spe-
cies” of the second animal.

I Patenting of an animal strain
should not prevent others from us-
ing the development to benefit all
of society.

But the scientists doing the re-
search contend that these concerns
are exaggerated. They say no harm
will come from their experiments

‘ if reasonable safety standards are ‘ '

followed.

The scientist credited with pio-
neering gene-splicing said the po-
tential-benefits of the animal re-
, search to enhance food supplies far
outweigh the possibility of risks.

“It’s much too early to worry” .
about risks, said the scientist, Ralph
L. Brinster. “We should worry when
we see what they’re going to pat-
ent.” Brinster teaches reproductive
physiology at the University of
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

Brinster and Richard Palmiter,
professor of biochemistry at the
University of Washington in Seattle,
were the first to insert human
genes into mice, thus developing gi-
ant mice. Such animals are called
“transgenic” animals.

Their research led to the ex-
periments now under way with var-
ious farm animals. Brinster said the
number of laboratories now doing
work to produce transgenic strains
had jumped to 100 last year from
. only about five in 1981.

Palmiter said that transgenic re-
search hadn’t yet improved live-
stock — and that it would take from
five to 10 years to do so.

“I suspect that the first trans-
genic animals will be crude and

k ‘-

will probably he laughed at,” Pal-

‘ miter said. “It’s possible that by in- ’

troducing a foreign gene into ani-

, mats, there would be consequences

that could be good or bad.

“But that’s how you learn. Those
strains of animals without desirable
characteristics would not be main-

, tained.”

The last whales on Earth face a bleak future. Japan has declared
it will not half the slaughter of these extraordinary marine mammals.

Defying a ban by the international Whaling Commission
(iWC) and betraying a commitment to the US, the Japanese
government recently announced it would kill at least 875 sperm
and minke whales annually for the next ten years. in a report
to the iWC, Japan stated that it was granting itself a “research
permit" to harpoon the whales, thus circumventing the iWC
ban on all commercial whaling.

Responsible scientists worldwide are denouncing Japan’s
prostitution of science. There is no scientific justification for such
a huge kill. Japanese scientists have failed to analyze mountains
of data from hundreds of thousands of whales killed'over the
past four decades.

The thousands of tons of “research” whale meat and oil
will be sold in Japan to profit the ruthless whaling industry.
lceland, Norway and South Korea are also using the-research
scam to circumvent the iWC ban.

Japan is already defying an international ban on trading in
whale products. The 95'nation Convention on international Trade
in Endangered Species has listed all ten great whale species

~ as endangered. Yet Japan has been supporting outlaw whaling
~ in other nations by importing whale meat Recently a 175vton
shipment from lceland was confiscated by West Germany while
enroute to Japan.

Japan’s Doublecross

Prime Minister Nakasone, visiting Washington today, must answer
for his nation’s duplicity on whaling as well as economic issues.
in December 1984, Nakasone’s government signed a bilateral

agreementwith the US. government to halt whaling by early
1988 in return for a US. pledge not to impose heavy sanctions
against the Japanese fishing industry for its defiance of iWC
whaling bans. During a lengthy court challenge to the bilateral

; by conservation groups, Japan pledged repeatedly—even before
the US. Supreme Court—that it “will cease whaling. . .as of
April ist, 1988."

Now Japan says it will continue the hunt for at least another
decade. The species with the most complex brain on our
planet will be converted to steaks, lubricating oil, mink food
and fertilizer.

Japan's outrageous deceit must be answered by imposition
of two US. laws: the Pelly Amendment. which authorizes the
President to embargo the fishery products of nations sub-
verting international fishery conservation agreements; and the

HOUSTON POST ,- April 26, 1987

Take a van ride to 3

Put on your safari hat Wednesday and join the
American Conservation and Education Society’s
(ACES) annual visit to the Wildlife and Exotic
Animal Center at College Station.

The center is part of the College of Veterinary
Medicine at Texas A&M University.

You’ll not only see newly acquired hoof stock
and African lions, but you’ll visit a one-of-a-kind
wildlife museum and the Wildlife and Exotic Ani-
mal Clinic. .

Hosts for the day will be Dr. Stephen Seager of
the wildlife center and Dave and Ann Ballard of
the Houston Safari Club. The Safari Club and the
ACES have contributed more than $60,000 to the
center during the past three years.

If you want to see those dollars in action, you’ll

need to meet a van from the university 8:45 a.m.
Wednesday at the Holiday Inn, located at the
West Little York exit of Highway 290 West in J er-
sey City. This also is where you’ll return at about
4:45 p.m.

But make your reservations first by calling the
center, 409/845-5760, or Ann Ballard of Houston,
558—6689. The deadline is Monday, and there are
only 30 seats available.

toises from the Seychelle Islands; a Siberian ti-
ger cub confiscated froma Florida drug dealer;
and 30 species of rare cranes and waterfowl
from all over the world.

In addition, thoroughbred horses sired by
such famous stallions as Secretariat and Native
Dancer are raised here, along with turkeys,
quails and peafowls, which the plantation sells.

Although the endangered animals bred at
White Oak are sold or traded to ”re utaole”
zoos and game farms around the wor d or re-
turned to the wild, Lukas saidpthe plantation
does not make money on the expensive endan-
gered species project.

”This is a conservation program,’ Lukas
said. ”We don’t even make enough to pay for
the animals' feed."

According to Lukas, Gilman Paper Co.
owner Howard Gilman, who flies down from
New York to spend weekends at the plantation,
is an ardent conservationist committed to sav-
ing rare animals such as the Florida panther
from extinction. ‘

“Most people think we’ve still got panthers
all over the State,” said Tom Lo an, who heads
the panther recoveryproject or the Florida
DNR. But Logan said Florida panthers have
been ”presecuted” by civilization into the
wildest reaches of the Everglades and two other
south Florida wilderness reserves.

I

Even there, the panther population is so ’

small that experts fear they will soon become
extinct. ”We count their numbers in dozens,
not in hundreds,” Logan said, estimating the
Florida panther population of fewer than 50.

”If we can re-establish panthers in one or
two areas of north Florida, I think we’ll have
the anther preserved in the state — but never
at a evel that we can take'for granted," he-said.

The Okefenokee Swamp, the-giant federal

wildlife reserve that lies on the Georgia-Flor- ..

ida bor er, is among the places where you'n

panthers will be released, Lukas said. 2 - .
“The Okefenokee, which has a corridor to-

 

canine teeth and walks with a
slight limp, the 4-year-old
panther cannot be returned to
the wild, Lukas said. '

Florida’s Osceola National Forest, is one of the

. The last panther sighted in
the Okefenokee was in the
19305, he said. in those days,
2 when little was known‘about

the secretive cats whose ee'rie
screams and graceful beauty
gave rise to many legends,
panthers were considered fair
game by hunters.

Since 1973, the Florida
panther has been on the fed-
eral endangered species list,
and in 1979, the state of Flor-
ida, which named the panther
its state animal, passed laws'
making the wanton killing of
the big cats a felony.

Struggle to Save
From

’ Lima

A clapboard fishing village
with a brothel and a crude dis-
cotheque has sprung up inside a
prized wildlifereserve, creating
what one conservationist calls
“the biggest sewer on the coast
of Peru.” '

Legislators say the only way to
protect the reserve from encroach-
ing civilizatiOn is to amputate about
60 percent of the 827,000-acre Para-
cas sanctuary and isolate the of-
fending fishing village, Laguna
Grande. '

Wildlife groups in Peru and
abroad are fighting the proposal to
' cut the refuge, the only marine re-
serve on the west coast of South
America.

The reserve juts into the Pacif-
ic Ocean on a peninsula 200 miles
southeast of the capital of Lima. It is
considered a key resting place for
nearly 50 bird species that migrate
twice a year between South and
North America.

The dismemberment would cut
many pre-Columbian archeological
sites from the reserve as well as one
of the largest sea lion rookeries in
the region".

Some environmentalists
charge that the preposal is a ploy to
permit developers to build a resort
hotel on a pristine bay and exploit

be abundant at Paracas.

' Since the boom began, fisher-

Now, 300 families live in Lagu'

At peak seasons, trucks bearing
scallop harvests travel 70 times a

Laguna Grande “the biggest sewer

Benavides, a former diplomat

contends that if Paracas is reduced
to eliminate Laguna Grande from '

“Paracas isn’t going to be ru-

said. “Paracas is going to be saved.”-

Such logic enrages other con-

Fairbanks with his mother.

The disabled Army veteran,

who lost an eye in a truck battery

explosion in 1972 while he was
stationed in West Germany, said
he’s spent $2,000 on supplies and
tack . .

His car also has been sacri-
ficed. But even with that, he ex-
pects he’ll have to work along the
way.

“It’ll soon be calf-branding
time,” he said. “I’ll wash dishes
if I have to.”

Watching Chester mosey
around his pasture, Owen said the
14-year-old mule will be carrying
“about 200 pounds including my-

self.” Both man and mule have
packed in the mountains, but Ow-
en admits he’s never done any-
thing this extensive before.

“But we’ll make it. I’ll ride him
at times, but I imagine I’ll do my
share of walking whether I want
to or not,” Owen said, estimating
they’ll average 20 to 25 miles a
day

Owen plans to take only a
week’s worth of supplies, includ-
ing food for 9-month-old Banjo
and 10 pounds of feed for Chester.
Home will be a tent.

Donations can be sent to Ride
for Life, International Bank of
Englewood, 5050 S. Broadway,

Jeannine DeGarmo, 762-8800, is
handling the account.

Owen’s next adventure? “I’m
going to teach my mules to swim
and go to Australia. I’ve always
wanted to go there,” he said, tap-
ping his cowboy hat

BUd’s Spuds sellsdudsat Macy’s

By LENORE SKENAZY

NEW YoaxwYou know it. I know it. But the Anheuser~
Busch spokesman, Bill Stolberg, apparently doesn’t want to

think about it.
As reported earlier (AA, March 30), Spuds, the spokes-

animal for Bud Light with its own new line of clothing, is a

she wasdefinitely hanging off the director’s chair, head

down. .
“Ooh, he’s so cute!” squealed one teen-ager, catching a .
glimpse.

“No he’s not. He’s ugly,” squealed another.

“He doesn’t seem to have the same personality Lassie
had,” noted an older observer. “He’s not barking.”

Millie Scott, a housewife, said she came to greet Spuds

because she had owned a similar English bull terrier for 15
years who “went to every one of my son’s graduations in a
black bow tie long before Spuds even existed." Apparently

. the dog, called Muggins, also went on stage to collect the
boy’s diplomas.

A man nearby seemed less enthused. “Two of those dogs
killed somebody in Ohio the other day. I wouldn’t go up
there petting him.” He didn’t. '

‘ “It’s an extraordinary turnout,” asserted Patricia Barry,
pr director for Macy’s. “People seem to be lingering longer
with him" than at other guest appearances, she said.

Hey, Pat, level with us: Isn’t Bud’s Spuds a she?

“He’s my friend, she's my friend—what difference does
it make?”

And really, it doesn’t. This same thought was shared by a
teen-ager in the crowd: Male or female dog, “Who cares?”

. she giggled. “Girls drink beer, too.”#

' girl. ‘
“He’s cool, he’s hip,” insisted Mr. Stolberg, introducing
Spuds at the grand opening of Macy’s Spuds MacKenzie
Shop, which will sell licensed T-shirts, visors and other
beach gear bearing the Spuds mug.
The merchandise is being sold through other Macy’s na-
‘ tionally, and is slated to be sold through other department
stores, an A—B spokesman said.
“I hear he’s a she,” said a woman near Mr. Stolberg.
“He’s the original party animal.” .
“She’s a he? Let's pull off her shirt and see.”
“We can’t do that! Would you pull off your shirt?”
“I would if I were a he.”
' “Well, it doesn’t matter if it’s a he or a she. He’s our
senior party consultant.” ‘
Under the glare of spotlights and camera strobes, being
greeted by hundreds of excited shoppers, Spuds drooped.
She still looked appealing-in a down-and-out way—but

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Spuds has every reason to be wearing these overalls.
because without them, “he” Is a “she.”

DENVER POST - April 27, 1987

Orphan ’ _ heroics earn her a home

By Norm Udevitz
Denver Post Staff Writer

O.P. clearly loves life and living. And not
just for herself. She wants her friends, like
Jill Simpson and Shandy, to stay healthy,
too

Indeed, except for O.P.’s insistent warning
on a cold, dark night last February, both Jill
and Shandy might well have perished from
inhaling deadly carbon monoxide fumes
while sleeping. .-

'By any standard, it was a heroic act,
made even more so by the fact that O.P. was
only 3 months old at the time. ‘

Friendly, but taciturn

Last week, O.P., after weeks of pursuit by
a relentless reporter, finally agreed to an in-
terview. She was friendly, but not very forth-
coming. She answered most questions by
shamelessly licking the reporter’s face.
Sometimes she would romp across the room
on all fours, yelping and barking — not too
surprising considering that OP. is a dog, and
still just a puppy at that.

But what a puppy!

“There’s no doubt about it. I owe my life
to O.P.,” said Simpson, the dog’s owner.
“And so does Shandy.” .

Shandy is a dog, too — a patient 8-year-old
who now spends most of her time mothering
0 .

Both dogs are named after drinks popular
in Simpson’s native England — GP. for Old
Peculiar, a well-known Yorkshire beer, and
Shandy for a beer-lemonade mix favored by
English women.

Didn’t plan to keep

Ironically, Simpson, a physical education
instructor at the Griffith School for Boys in
Larkspur, didn’t plan to keep O.P. when the
nondescript, brown-and-white puppy first
landed on her doorstep.

“Somebody dumped the dog at the school
one snowy day last February,” she said. .
"It’s against the rules for the boys to have
dogs there so I agreed to take her temporari-
ly until I could find a home for her. I already
had Shandy and we lived in a small apart-
ment in Larkspur. There was no room for
another dog.” .

A few nights later, O.P. earned a perma-
nent place in Simpson’s life.

“It was about 3 am. I was sound asleep.‘
So was Shandy. Then, I became aware of a
sound at the side of the bed. It woke me up.
And there was O.P., looking up at me, crying
and scratching at the blanket, like she was
trying to get it off of me. Shandy was still
asleep but my throat was tight and I couldn’t
breathe. I knew something was wrong, very
wrong. I managed to get up and stagger to
the front door. I got it open and fell ﬂat on
my face in the hall. Both of the dogs followed
me and stayed with me until I came to.”

 

 

0.P. gives-a kiss to Jill Simpson, whose life she saved.

Later, authorities told Simpson that both
she and Shandy would have been dead in an-
other 30 minutes. .

“As it was, I had a fierce, pounding head-
ache for several days afterwards, and O.P.
threw up a lo ” said Simpson.

. Simpson quickly moved out of the apart-
ment to a spacious cottage with a large ..
fenced yard in the foothills above Larkspur.
And now both dogs have plenty of running
room and chipmunks to chase.

O.P., a mix of collie, shepherd and terrier,
with ﬂoppy ears that sometime pop up, has

thrived on the new surroundings.

 

The Denver Post I Dennis Chamberlir

“She has just about doubled in size in two
months. She’s a real armful now and pretty
soon no one is going to be holding her. That’s
for sure,” said Simpson. .

Also “for sure” is O.P.‘s sleeping place:
right next to Simpson’s bed. *

 

 




love my dog because I know they do
not love me back. These animals are
afraid of people. They’re not pets.
They’re not going to protect me. They
have no interest in me.”
She has a keen interest in their wel-
fare but also realizes she would be un-
able to get her educational program off
the ground with “a mother-raised cat. "
So it’s important, she says, to build a
teacher-cat relationship when the ani-
mal' 13 young.
When her cats are six weeks old,
Hilker starts training them on a leash.
She takes them on walks at 10
weeks. .
Sheteaches them commands: “Seat”
when she wants them to sit down.
“Down” when she wants them to lie

.down. “Come” when she wants them

to walk toward her.

“It’s not circus training,” she says.
“We don’t train them to sit up, roll over
and jump through hoops.” Her message

is purely educational: “I always say to-

kids, ‘Zoos are not bad. Zoos are fun
and the animals are well-cared for.’ But
the trouble is you don’t learn anything
when you’re staring at themfrom a
distance."

She can’t overemphasize enough to

her audiences, however, that wild ani-
mals aren’t pets. Neither are they
nasty.

"Only people are nasty because we
know how to trick each other. We
know 'how to do nasty, conniving
things,” she says. “Wild animals aren’t
like that. They‘ re very open If you
frighten them, they will bite you It’s as
simple as that. If you corner them, they
will attack you.

“Are they dangerous? You bet your ’

life they’ re dangerous. Are my cats
dangerous? They sure are.

“Angel (the cheetah) who’s licking
my hand.. .if somebody she doesn’t
know walks into her cage and tries to
leash her up, she’ll strike at them. You
don’t do those things to wild animals.
You handle wild animals with total re-

. spect for what they are: They’re wild

animals.

“You go in knowing that they’re
never going to be domestic pets.
They’re never going to love you. These
cats don't love me. They respect me."

Inside a fenced-in area at the 200,

I Hilker plays a game of wiffle ball with

Angel, the 80-pound cheetah. ' Hilker
tosses the plastic ball, which is at-
tached to a 10—foot rope from a pole she
is holding. Angel stabs at the ball with
her front paws and growls while cir-
cling Hilker. The game of toss is repeat-
ed until Angel no longer wantsto play.
Hilker returns Angel to her cage.

Out comes Sahiba. Hilker begins a

bowling game with the ”5-year-old,

white bengal tiger, who weighs 200
pounds. She throws a large ball at Sa-
hiba and he snatches it with his paws.
It is obvious Sahiba will never be a
catcher like Johnny Bench. Nor, One
should add, does he have Bench’s genial
disposition.

Hilker, for instance, would dare not

take Sahiba ’with her on school visits.
She would not be able to controlhim.
“I’ll take a 50-pound baby tiger, but no
way could I manage a 200op0und ti-
ger,” she says Sahiba this summer will
be moved to the Columbus Zoo where
he will be placed on exhibit with other
white bengal tigers. Eventually he’ll
grow to 500 pounds.

"‘In no way do I want to give kids the
impression that these are pets,” she

says. “They are not pets.

“And no way do I want kids when
they see people with furs to run up to
them and kick them in the chins or in-
sult them. I own a cheetah coat. My
mother gave me a cheetah coat when I
was an 18-year-old graduating from
high school. And I thought it was the
most beautiful thing I had ever seen.
But nobody told me that you killed 10
cheetahs to make a coat. And nobody
told me that these animals are
vanishing.

“So I don’t hate people who wear
furs. They obviously don’t know what
they‘ re doing. But we are growing a
generation of people that do know, he-

. cause I’m telling them and thousands of

others are telling them.”
' Hilker was delighted when television
personality Bob Barker, who emceed
this year’s Miss USA. pageant. refused
to do the show if the contestants ap-
peared in authentic fur coats. Wearing
furs, she says, is an “ego kick” people
should have outgrown years ago.

She tells others that you can't‘ buy a
cheetah coat in this country.

“But, ” she says, “you can buy a chee-
tah coat any place in EurOpe or a
clouded leopard coat that takes 40 cats

to make for just a couple hundred dol- .

lars in China. Clouded leopards are so
rare that you rarely see them anymore.
So now we’ve got to take our message
internationally.”

In November, Hilker will fly with
her cheetah to Central America to
spread the gospel about the decline of
the cat species.

She doesn’t see herself as a modern-
day Marlin Perkins who traveled the
globe “educating a whole generation of
us about animals” with his Wild King-

dom television show.

Hilker admired Perkins.

“I never missed a. Marlin Perkins
show because I wanted to see if Jim
ever came out of the bush. Remember
Marlin looking at us and saying, ‘I’ll
stay here while Jim goes into the
bush,’ ” she says, laughing. “Marlin
Perkins did some hokey things, but he
also made a quantum jump in increas-
ing people’s awareness about wild ani-
mals. People who never knew before
about musk-ox were talking on Mon- '
day about the musk-ox after seeing
Marlin’s show on Sunday night.”-

So, perhaps Monday there’ll be kids
who attended Hilker’s weekend ses-
sions at Aullwood still talking about
the importance of the cheetah or the
lynx.

“ T’hat 8 what I’m trying to do -- in-
crease the awareness of people, espe—
cially kids, to these vanishing species,’
she says. “I was in Africa last month,
the fabulous home of the cheetah. And
the cheetah’ 5 population is steadily go-
ing downhill. Cheetahs are being
poached for their fur. Their habitat is
shrinking because people just don’ t un-
derstand their part in the world.

“Yes, this splendid creature is in a lot
of trouble and I don’t want to see any
more of them on pe0ple’ s backs There
are just 202 in captivity in North Amer-
ica. Just 202. So I leash Angel up and
take her to school with me. She’s liter-
ally giving her life for her species.”

And Cathryn Hilker is literally giv-
ing her life for cats.

Better cats, though, instead of, say,
elephants.

“I would have a hard time taking a
full- -grown elephant to the schools,”

she laughs. In fact, she says, it would

have been better if she had gotten into
bugs. “Oh, we talk about bugs. We’re
all tied together. Who’s more impor- ,
tant? You or the cockroach? You’d be
surprised at .the answer. We’re both

equally important.

And that’s the
truth.” . ‘

 




 

 

Cathryn Hilker ﬁghts ‘ '
to protect the future
of wortd’s exotic cats

By Mickey Davis
FEATURES source

INCINNATI — Cathryn Hilker wears a chey

Mouse watch on her wrist and keeps a big place in her
heart for exotic cats. No. Hilker isn’t playing a cat-
and-mouSe game. She simply wants to keep exotic cats
alive.

There’s nothing that annoys her more than seeing a
- fur coat on someone's back. Hilker’s fur fury is particu-
larly aroused when Joan Collins. Dynasty/'8 Alexis, swaggers into
a room and flips the full-length lynx fur coat she’s wearing onto a
‘ couch. “I get so angry," Hilker says. .

Hilker. who at 6-foot-2 is taller — and wittier -— than fabled
wild animal lover Marlin Perkins. coils like a mountain lion when she
sees wild fur being flaunted. “I just want to go up to Joan Collins
and say, ‘Don’t you know what you're doing?‘ and to tell her to please

‘ not do that.
"‘Do people realizethat it takes 40to SOlynxes to makeone '7
coat? Or 10 Cheetahs to make a coat?

“People think this is a renewable resource —- like the cow that
is used for making my shoes. But the lynx and the cheetah are not re-
newable. Their populations are going down with excessive
trapping.

. “It‘s-so easy to say. ‘Now who really cares?‘ And who does?

“I mean. is your life going to be any different if the cheetah isn't
here. or if the cougar and the lynx and the bengal tiger aren’t here?
The answer is, yes, indeed. It really will be different.

“Because when the cheetah goes and the cougar goes and the ti-
ger goes and the lynx goes. what is quality? Here. you finally have to
ask yourself: ‘What in the world am I doing here?’ "

Hilker, who grew up in Mason and once taught Shakespeare to
high school classes. now takes a cheetah. a baby tiger and a Siberian
lynx into 50 schools a year with the Cincinnati Zoo's “Outreach"
program. She wants youngsters to know about the value of endan-
gered species. ,

There is no question with Hilker about whether “To save or not
to save" these animals. Her message isn’t soft and furry. It has teeth.

“Look." she says. “as humans we have to learn before it’s too .
late that we share the earth with many. many other Species and that
their disappearance could. in fact. foretell the demise of our very
own species. From early on, we’ve got to know that ‘I share the earth.
It’s not just my domain.‘ All species are interrelated. All life is
interrelated.” . " 5‘ ~ . ,

Hilker. a 55-year-oldrwith the spunk of a‘tiger. began as a vol-
unteer speaker with the Cincinnati Zoo 23 years ago. "

Now she trains exotic cats there and for the past six years has
been conducting out-of-theozoo classes. Saturday and Sunday. she’ll
have a cheetah, a baby tiger and a lynx with her for 1:30 and 3 _
p.m. programs as part of the Aullwood Audubon Center and Farm’s ~
“Wildlife Festival."

Hilker has loved cats since her ﬁrst visit as a child to the zoo,-
but she makes it clear to youngsters that cats don’t love her.

“I love them because Iadmire them," she says. “but i do not
love them as I love my 16-year-old son. I do not love them even as I

earlier draft that acknowledged that
the coastal plain “is the most biologi-

of wildlife activity on the refuge.”

argued, that wildlife and oil can co-
exist. But there is no assurance that

BARROW SUN - BARROW, ALASKA - 4/30/87

Recommends-
Full Leasing of Coastal Plain

..

Interior Secretary

. ’ By the Interior Department’s own reck-
oning, the chance of finding oil under Alas-

“ ka’s Arctic Coastal plain is less than one in
five. On the other hand, the likelihood of
. inflicting irreversible harm on the herd of

porcupine caribou that use the land for
calving is so great as to be a near certainty.

Those statistics dictate against drilling
for oil there. Yet Interior Secretary Donald
Hodel is asking Congress to allow mineral
exploration on all 1.5 million acres in the

j plain, a part of the 19 million-acre Arctic
, ', National Wildlife Refuge.

On two levels, Mr. Hodel’s recommenda-

tion is unwarranted and dangerous. First,

-"there is his spurious argument that the U.S.

.. must find domestic oil reserves to reduce
- dependency on foreign sources. But orl re-

serves are finite. The sooner the Interior

cies acknowledge this and begin in earnest

Second, the proposed drilling would
have disastrous consequences for the envi-
ronment and the wildlife that Congress in-
tended to protect by designating this area a
refuge. Consider what has happened on the
North Slope. There, 17,000 oil spills have
been reported since 1973, with no recovery
of vegetation. The Interior Department
predicted earlier that drilling would mean
an “unquantifiable loss of wilderness val- 1
ues” and a “population decline and change
in distribution of 20-40 percent” of caribou.
Disruptions in habitat and food sources
would cause other species also to decline.

By recommending oil exploration on this
fragile remnant of unplundered beauty,
Mr. Hodel has evinced an insensitivity to
environmental concerns not seen since his
unlamented predecessor, James Watt, left
office. He has served neither his adminis-
tration nor the public well. The only ones
cheering are the oil companies.

said. “The rigs might mean increas-

“ Gun lobby holds its convention on heels of rare legislative defeats and criticism'by‘ police

 

I Going into its annual convention
this weekend in Reno, Nev., the Na-
tional Riﬂe Association seems at odds
with itself, one of the more unlikely
victims of institutional schizophrenia.
The same body that strode for years like
a gladiator across the political playing
ﬁeld, obliterating virtually every gun-
control proposal from the US. Capitol
to local town halls, has lately become
the victim of its own success, facing ﬁre
from its own members for losing major
battles on legislation banning the manu—
facture of machine guns and armor-
piercing bullets.

“For the ﬁrst time,” says John Nich-
ols of the Oregon State Riﬂe and Pistol
Association, citing the constitutional
right to keep and bear arms, “the Second
Amendment didn’t mean what it says.”

Predictably, leaders

Dissidents,

cer, Paige Massey of Austin, Tex., says
the NRA fell down on its historic role
to defend all ﬁrearms. “It should have
adopted a NATO doctrine,” says Mas-
sey, “that an attack on one gun-owner
group is an attack on all.”

As if dissent within the ranks were not
enough, the NRA also has managed to
offend one of its staunchest allies—the
police. Complaining that police oﬂicers

avoid a lawsuit. At the same time, ,
NRA membership was declining from
a high of 3 million a few years ago to
an estimated 2.7 million today.
Election maneuvering

In the center of the storm is J. War-
ren Cassidy, who succeeded Knox as
NRA lobbyist and then took over the
top job after Arnett’s ﬁring. Critics ac-
Cuse Cassidy of being too quick to sur-
render to Capitol Hill opponents, even
though NRA’s outpouring of $1.6 mil—
lion to congressional campaigns should
easily have given it the upper hand.
Cassidy, who contends he has been
treated unfairly in the press, refused to
give interviews before the Reno meet-
ing. He did appear recently in a rare
debate against Knox before gun buffs in
Portland, Oreg. Cassidy angered some

by saying that the

 

of the NRA reject accu-
sations that the organi-
zation has compro-
mised members’ rights.
But even as the NRA
moves ‘to stem the ris- ”1
ing tide of criticism, it
is becoming increasing-
ly evident that the once
feared gun lobby is
wrestling with a per-
plexing identity crisis.
“Their idea of negotia-
tion,” says the NRA’s
former chief lobbyist,
Neal Knox, “is decid-
ing whether you should
have your arm taken off
at the shoulder or at the
wrist.” At issue are not
just the political for-
tunes of the NRA but

but might contest it in
court on constitutional
grounds.

convention, Cassidy
may have a crucial ad-

legislation in the Unit-
ed States for several years to come.

Knox, who would like NRA mem-
bers to install him as chief executive at
the Reno convention, now leads the
Firearms Coalition—a group of NRA
members who want the organization to
take a harder line against the “anti-
gunners.” His appeal strikes a chord in
many quarters. Arizona state Senator
Wayne Stump, calling NRA leaders too
devoted to the “Washington cocktail
circuit,” says that “in the politics of give
and take, they think it’s always give.”
Machine-gunners upset

NRA stalwarts aren’t the only ones
taking potshots at the group. Machine—
gun enthusiasts—angry that Congress
halted production of their favorite
weapon—have formed their own group,
the National Firearms Association, to
seek a reversal on Capitol Hill. An ofﬁ-

with automatic-weapons ﬁre and ammu-
nition that can penetrate “bulletproof”
vests, law-enforcement authorities broke
ranks with the NRA over the 1986 gun
bill. At its annual meeting last year, the
International Association of Chiefs of
Police took the unprecedented step of
banning the NRA from setting up a
booth. Jerald Vaughn, director of the
chiefs’ association, calls the NRA “one
of the most potentially dangerous orga-
nizations in the United States today.”
On yet another front, the NRA
ﬁnds itself plagued by strife within its
own headquarters in Washington, DC.
In the midst of the congressional gun-
control ﬁght last year, the NRA dis-
missed its chief executive, G. Ray Ar-
nett, in a messy internal dispute that
reportedly cost the group $400,000——to

 

Organizations that
lobby for gun control are taking scant
comfort from the NRA’s woes. Says
Barbara Lautman of Handgun Control,
Inc., which seeks restraints such as rec-
ords checks for prospective gun owners:
“We’re talking about a ﬁght between
extremists and ultra-extremists.”

Whatever happens in Reno, the NRA
is not about to fade away. It has been
successful, for instance, in persuading 28
states to prohibit localities from passing
gun-control laws, and it is working for
passage of similar laws elsewhere. The
big question now for the NRA is whether
it can settle its problems and regain its
preeminent position. “The only power
that can stop NRA,” says John Aqui-
lino, the group’s former communica-
tions director, “is the NRA itself.” I

are rarely disappointed.

, There are 100 acres here, teeming with
life. It takes time to absorb the meaning of
the discreet E for Endangered that marks
so many of the exhibits. Yet it is that E

. which has changed the function of the zoo.

Fifty years ago, zookeepers were still
collectors. They harvested specimens from
the wealth of the wild. Today, their roles

 

 

have nearly been reversed. The wild is an

. endangered species itself. and the zoo is at

times .the last haven and source of ani-
mals. As my guide tells me repeatedly,
"Zoos have gone from being consumers to
producers of animals." '

Those entertained by the chimps or the

' sea lion show may not realize it.'but the-

real mission of the zoo is located else-
where. in the ramshackle buildings that
house CRES, the Center for the Reproduc-
tion of Endangered Species.

Throughout the world. species are dis-
appearing at a rate of 100 a year. The last
of the free-flying condors was just taken to
live in captivity 40 miles away in the 200's
Wild Animal Park. Here a team of scien-
tists — geneticists. pathologists. behavior-
ists - are working to save. replenish and
perhaps even to return to the wild some of
these creatures.

“We haven't yet suffered catastrophic
losses says." Oliver Ryder. a committed
man and geneticist. “So time Is impor-
tant." At CRES they are pressing to learn
how to help animals do in captivity what
comes naturally in the wild: bear off-
spring.

CRES has set up a computerized cap-
tive-breeding program. cloned genes and
frozen animal cells. They are learning
about the reproduction systems of a vari-
ety of species. each as different and com-

success stories. Dr. Ryder tells in glowing
detail the story about the Mongolian horse,
a creature unseen in the wild since 1968, a
victim of nomads and domestic animals
that usurped their water supply. There.
were once only 13 such horses in the
world, all of them in zoos. Today there are
650. This man who knows the pedigree of
each describes the goosebump emotion he
felt when he he saw a herd of “his" run-
ning free, but of sight of fences in Calgary.
He hopes to return some to Mongolia.

This hi-tech fertility clinic. the commit-
ment of its team, is enormously impres-
sive. But you cannot visit without taking '
home a souvenir of some sadness. Small
clusters of scientists in places like San Die-
go or London or Cincinnati are trying to
save species by the handful while the ex.
tinctlon rate may rise to a species an hour. '
It takes sophisticated hi-tech talent to re-
store a sample of what we should con-
serve.

Far back across the continent. in Wash-
ington, DC. the government has decided

, that other scientists can patent animals

they “create" through gene splicing. In ef-
fect. they can own their own species. They
will claim as “theirs" pigs with less fat and
cows with more milk. At times our domi-
nation. our pride in mastering the world. is
riddled with hubris. We decide which spe-
cies live and die. which are created and
which disappear. The standard is their
usefulness to us.

"The only way to truly save species."
as Dr. Ryder admits readily. "is to save
them in their ecosystems." it is the knowl-
edge of disappearing ecosystems that inev-
itably raises questions about our own
species.

Modern humans are more adept at ma-
nipulating the environment than living
within it. if they had a human exhibit
here. it would also have an E on it. What is

The guest list for Matthew Beall’s
5.36m birthday party included Matt, six
other kids, three moms, a camel, an
aardvark and an 18-year-old ele-
‘ﬁphant named Mai Tai.
The exotic guests arrived courtesy
”of the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical
Garden, which brought a sampling of
- animals to Carillon Park early Satur-
_ day afternoon to be viewed and
' stroked by park patrons.
The animals —— also a barn owl,.a
. macaw, a boa constrictor, a rabbit, a
baby alligator and a Vietnamese pot-
"bellied pig -— were at the park on
South Patterson Boulevard from
‘5 noon to shortly after 1 pm. as part of
a promotional tour.
' Some of the 200’s big cats also
, stopped in at Aullwood Audubon
a Center to take part in Aullwood’s
‘ wildlife festival. Dayton Mayor Rich-
~ ard Clay Dixon proclaimed Saturday
;-_ as “Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical
Garden Day” in recognition of the
visits.
. Matt, of Kettering, said he liked
the elephant best “because he was
'big — he was humongous!”
He said he was having a great
birthday. And his mother, Ann, also
* thought it was a good way to have a
abirthday party.

she said. “It’s a good idea. They

Bill Feldmann of Washington Twp.
brought his three children, ages 11, 8
and 3. “I think it’s neat that they’re
traveling around to give kids outside
.the immediate Cincinnati area a
chance to see the animals,” he said. ‘
Lindsay Ryan, 8, of Centerville,
said she liked the rabbit best because
“it was the softest.” She also liked
the “chubby" black Vietnamese pig.
She didn’t care as much for the boa
constrictor. Asked how it felt to
touch it, she simply said, “slime.”
' John Robbins of Dayton brought
four children to the park, but they
arrived too late to get a good look at
the animals.

Alldubon ZOO

Has Special
Place for Kids

Hand in hand, two small girls dash to-
ward a huge ﬁberglass model of a shark’s
jaw. No fear shows on their faces as they
climb into the mouth. Then, giggling and
squealing, they rush toward a dark, cav-
ernous building. Inside, their eyes open
wider to take in the nocturnal world.

Visiting a zoo is usually an eye-opening
experience for children and adults alike.
But at New Orleans’ Audubon Zoo every-
one can explore the animal kingdom
through the eyes of a child in the Wisner
Children’s Village.

In one section, children pit their athletic
abilities against the distances jumped by a
ﬂea, kangaroo, and bullfrog. They can also
swing across a horizontal ladder like a
siamang ape. They may discover that they
aren’t as quick as the ape, who can com-
plete the course in less than a second.

But all is not fun and games at the zoo.
While crawling over life-size models of a
giant ground sloth and ancient sea turtle,
the young zoogoers learn that those ani-
mals are now extinct, that some contempo-
rary species are in danger of facing
extinction, and just how people can help
save the endangered ones.

“The children’s wing ﬁts in with our
overall plan of making this a zoo sanc-
tuary,” says Executive Director Ronald
Forman. “Our number one aim at Audu-
bon is education, and here we’re trying to
educate and also be a fun place.”

In the Zoo Lab, children touch the
bones and furs of animals, examine marine
life, and inspect tiny animals under a mi-
croscope. Through windows, they watch
workers preparing food for the 200’s hun-
gry residents.

For the children, it’s naturally much

easier to get on the same level as ani-
mals. And in the village their worlds come
even closer together, as kids climb into a
treehouse, among the birds. They also
enter the fascinating underground realm
of the prairie dog by crawling through a
tunnel and then peering out from an
above-ground bubble, while the busy,

yipping dogs scamper around them.

There are elephants to ride, small ani-
mals to pet, and other curious creatures to
study. A new member of the children’s
area is the rock hyrax, an animal that is
related to the elephant but actually looks
more like a rodent. In their native South
African habitats, they once grew to the
size of bears, but the modem-day descen-
dants are no larger than a rabbit.

“There are many kids who won’t go
near the animals. In a city like New Or-
leans, some have never seen an animal
other than a dog or cat,” says Forman.

But it usually doesn’t take long for even
the most urban of children to lose their
inhibitions. The sight of a diapered baby
gorilla taking its bottle, or the feel of a
sheep’s soft wool, or a ride on an ele-
phant’s back brings a warm smile to the
face, of almost any child.

The Whole World
Goes Pandas

Two Chinese ambassadors
receive cheers in the Bronx

 

H e had good news for New Yorkers,
Mayor Edward Koch said last week:
taxes were being reduced, and the police
department was being enlarged. “But the
single thing people will care about,” he
added, “is that the pandas have come to
town.” How right he was. Last Thursday
morning, as a gong was sounded and a
comely female named Yong Yong wad-
dled into her enclosure at the Bronx Zoo,
New York City was gripped with that well-
known but incurable fever: pandamania.

WELCOME TO NEW YORK, PANDAS,
said a handmade sign held up by one of
several dozen waiting schoolchildren.
HELLO, LING LING AND YONG YONG, said
another. And even more to the point:
NEW YORK IS THE PANDAS! Before Ling
Ling (Ringing Bell), the male half of the
team, and Yong Yong (Forever and Ever)
go home at the end of October—they are
on loan from the Peking Zoo for only six
months—an estimated 2 million people
(2,000 an hour) will have seen and no
doubt fallen in love with them. “There‘s
something special about pandas," says
Koch. “They bring people back to their
childhood.”

Even the meanest people, those who
kick dogs, throw bottles at cats and step
on robins’ eggs, get teary-eyed and putty-
legged when they see a panda rolling
around on its ample posterior, twisting its
puffy body into a seemingly impossible
position, or eating an apple—nothing
more exotic than an applel—with its
handlike paw. “I can’t think of any ani-
mal that compares,” says William Con-
way, director of the New York Zoological
Society. “People love penguins, but the in-
terest in pandas is extraordinary. There
appears to be an innate response of, ‘Oh,
isn’t it cute?’ ”

At the seven zoos outside China in
which they have taken up permanent res-
idence, pandas are always the
top act. If the adults cause a stir,
their babies cause chaos. When
Tokyo’s Ueno Zoo had a blessed
event last year, 270,000 people
suggested names for the little
cub. Tong Tong (Child) was the
eventual choice, and 13,000
stood in line for the ﬁrst
glimpse of that particular child.
Another 200,000 a day called
the “Dial-a-Panda” hot line to
hear him squealing.

Schoolchildren greeting th

aﬁa

Yong Yong testing the furniture in her expensive New York digs

permanent exhibit, schoolchildren send
them yearly valentines. When the female
(also named Ling Ling) fell ill in 1982, she
received thousands of get-well cards;
some admirers tearfully called for the lat-
est word on her condition. China lent a
pair to the Los Angeles Zoo in conjunc-
tion with the 1984 Olympics; attendance
more than doubled, and pandamaniacs
endured three-hour waits. San Francis-
co’s zoo, where the couple went next, saw
attendance jump 50%.

But Ling Ling, Yong Yong and the
other actors in what might be called Chi-
na’s Traveling Panda Act—two more will
be lent to the Netherlands’ Beekse Bergen
park this month—are meant to do more
than entertain. Pandas also carry a mes—
sage: they are an endangered species with
a bleak future. Only a few, 700 or so, still
roam the mountains of central China, and
there are not enough in zoos to ensure
their survival.

ike most other endangered species, the

pandas are a victim of what Conway
terms the “inexorable increase in human
beings.” Chinese farmers have chopped
down many of the bamboo stands that
once fed them, and the pandas have been
forced to ever higher ground and smaller
spaces. But bamboo is not very nutritious
(90% is water), and pandas must eat as
much as 40 lbs. a day to maintain their
cuddly look. Actually, they love meat, but
nature has made them too slow to catch
anything worth nibbling on. So they are

left with bamboo, which moves only with
the wind.

The hapless animals are also bedev-
iled by what many other species—rabbits,
for instance—would consider an unhappy
sex life. Solitary by nature, they rarely en-
joy one another’s company. During their
stay in New York, for instance, Ling
Ling, who at 1% is too young for mating
anyway, will never be allowed out at the
same time as the six-yearaold, heavier
(187 lbs., vs. 119 lbs.) and
presumably more aggres-
sive Yong Yong.

One answer to the
pandas’ plight is obvious:
the Chinese should give
them more space and
more bamboo. In recent
years the Chinese, with
considerable financial
help from _panda lovers
worldwide, have tried to
do that. They have set

 

 

that have different vari-
eties of bamboo; if one
kind dies out, the pandas will not starve
to death, as at least 138 did during a ma-
jor bamboo famine in the mid—‘70s In-
deed, Conway, whose 200 has taken a
lead in preserving endangered species,
gives the Chinese high marks. “They’re
spending more effort on pandas than the
US. is on grizzly bears, which are even
rarer in the Lower 48 states,” he says.
“They’re an example to us.”

But high marks may not be
good enough. Unless reserves
are made larger, he says, and
connected so that their denizens
can move from one to another.
“the demise of the panda is pre-
dictable.” He adds, “There are
probably fewer pandas extant
than there are Rembrandts. We
ought to give them at least as
much reverence as we give the
works of man.” The crowds
cheering them on at the Bronx
Zoo last week seemed to be do-
ing just that. —By Gerald Clarke

t’s only one of zoologist Rick Pas-

working on ways to keep the beavers

We’ll try some repellents on the live
trees, and then give them logs to keep
them happy and chewing.”

Passaro says, “We have a pair of
bobcats, male and female siblings who
were born in captivity last May. Bob-
cats can be found in nearby areas
such as the Dismal Swamp on the
Virginia-North Carolina border.” It is
thought that, because they were born
in captivity, these cats will be some-
what easier to handle.

Passaro, 29, also has to make sure
that the skunks stay on the ground
and the opossums stay in the trees in
their shared corner of the woods: “We
should have enough room . . . Yes, the
skunks are de-scented.”

Shopping

The Color of Stamps
Rent a gorilla stud for Metro-
Zoo? No problem—with 10,000
: S&H Green Stamp books, you’ve
' got it. How about free concerts
for the kids? For a mere 4,500
stamps, PACE will arrange it.
How about drug prevention

 

Formerly the Peninsula Nature
Science Center, the Living Museum is
the only facility of its kind east of the
Mississippi. A $3 million renovation
begun in February 1986 has yielded

an expanded building with a planetar- _

ium and observatory and a multi-part
exhibit of the James River with live
ﬁsh, plants, and animals. There’s also
an aviary with dozens of birds and a
nocturnal exhibit, and a 3,000-gallon
ocean tank teeming with fish, sea
turtles, sharks, and more. ‘

Outside, a boardwalk leads visitors
into Passaro’s domain around the
shore of Deer Park Lake past open air
exhibits including those of the bea-
vers, as well as otter, foxes, deer, bob-
cats, and bald eagles. To maintain the
natural feel, containment is con-
cealed. The creatures live behind hid-
den or camouﬂaged fencing and walls,
some of it behind bushes, or as in the

programs for middle school
kids—the Starting Place will do
it, for enough stamps.

These are just a few of the
more exotic ways that shoppers
at Publix supermarkets in South
Florida can redeem the S&H
greenies, a process which may
soon go high-tech. The green
stamp, you see, has come a
long way.

S&H Green Stamp trading
began in 1896 when two Mich-
igan merchants, Thoran A.
Sperry and Shelly B. Hutchin-
son, devised the stamps as a
reward for general store pa-
trons who paid their bills
promptly. In 1914, the idea
caught on with food stores.

Publix has held the only S&H
franchise in Florida since 195 3.
But now you can do more
than redeem the stamps at your
S&H gift shop or trade them for
food discounts. A few years
ago, when MetroZoo needed
$20,000 to buy Ramar the gor—
illa, hundreds of Girl Scouts
and other volunteers rounded
up 10,000 books to cover the
costs (now you know how
much they are worth). Another
4,500 books collected by South
Florida school kids last year un-
derwrote PACE concerts for the
students. A similar stamp drive
this year is expected to cover
some costs of a drug prevention
program in the schools.

Now the S&H company is in-
troducing new methods to save
customers time. One is to use
larger value stamps that require
no licking. The other is more
revolutionary: the shopper is
issued a computer card con-
taining a micro-chip. The card
automatically records stamp
credits for the customer as he
or she checks out. The card is
then used at the redemption
center, or for purchase credits
at the store. Or for contribu-
tions to your favorite charity—
though we can’t predict how
the IRS will treat any deduc—
tions. Both options are current-
ly under review by Publix.

Dear Humane Society Member:

As a result of year letter the UEP Board will review its established guide-
lines for “Good Husbandry Practices of Laying Hens.‘

The Board of Directors of UEP met recently and directed staff to establish
a balanced ”Scientific Review Panel" consisting of animal health scientists
to help UEP rev ew its guidelines and suggest the most humane practices for
the handling of chickens used to produce eggs.

Unlike its European counterparts, UEP has already voluntarily developed:

— ‘ situation statement.
i5‘?.'s'."%£.-';-lines.
n animal welfare committee.
voluntary compliance program.
certification program.
pproval of the establishment of a scientific review panel.

We've attached a summary of our industry developed guidelines. We agree
with you, however, that more may need to be done and, as mentioned, that
process has begun. .

Farmers do care about their animals. Production levels do reflect the care.
of their birds. As an industry, we have to practice animal welfare 365 days
a year. We share your concern for the welfare of the chickens.

We would ask that you reconsider your pledge to boycott our product. Farmers
want, need and appreciate you as customers. We do work hard, and will work
hard to be reSpaaaible and responsive to your concerns.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Pope:

I have your "form“ letter of.April (no date), 1987 re the way laying hens
are maintained. - .

I'm afraid until I hear differently from the Humane Society of the United
States, I will have little faith in the farmer changing his way of raising
not Only laying hens, but checkens raised fOr the market to eat.

The mailing I received from them recently (copy enclosed) made me liter-
ally sick to my stomach. To think that so—called civilized individuals
could treat a living creature in such a way. I would never have believed
it if I hadn't received this information. To think that these living
creatures are crammed into tiny battery cages, and fighting constantly.
Of course, they would fight. It is the natural act for a chicken to peck
around the ground, and to deprive this creature of so simple a pleasure
is completely inexcuseable to me. » '

No - until I knowdifferently - and I really have no hope that the farmer
is going to change his way - he is a little too eager for money - I will
not eat eggs, but I will also not eat pork.

I'm afraid The Animals' Agenda of December 1986 told it only too well.
Enclosed is a copy of a reprint from that issue "The Issues Seen Through
the Color of aney“. Of course, the farmer doesn't want any laws made to
control the way he raises animals. He'd have been out of business long ago
had we had the humane 13WS'We need.

It is my earnest hope that farmers will finally realize that many, many
people are just sick and tired of the cruelties inflicted upon helpless
animals because after all, they are "only animals". ‘More and more people
are coming to realize that the cruelty has got to be stopped - one way or
another.

I truly hope your UEP is going to change its ways.

Sincerely,

CMrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough
Encls.

Recent tragedies that involved hu-

Smught demands for more safety in the
ﬁreets by focusing on the elimination

23 Owners of breeds such as boxers and
pugs, mistakenly identified as pit bulls,
yell know that it is impossible to be
p‘bsolutely sure of identifying a particu-
iii: dog as to its heritage.

She American Staffordshire Terrier

To add to the confusion, through the

Dr. Brisbin brings a scientific atti-
tude to the present controversy over pit
bulls. Dogs resembling and labeled “pit
bulls” could be the third most popular
breed in the U.S., with a postulated
90,000, according to a sampling of clas-
sified ads from all over the country.

Brisbin collects and analyzes data on
dog bites, genetics and the structure of
dog jaws and skulls. Therefore, he was
able to lay to rest the exaggeration that
pit bull jaws exert significantly more
“pounds of pressure per square inch"
that those of other dog breeds.

“Newspapers printed that, and I was
able to trace the story back to some
members of the American Stafford-
shire Terrier Club who were bragging
on their dogs,” he said.

“There is no meaningful way to cal-
culate bite pressure per square inch.” A
study using the principles of physics
and mechanics and a “fancy statistical
procedure” for studying skulls estab-
lished “to the best of my knowledge the
skull is no differeu .”

EVERLY HILLS, Calif. —
Problem pooches that
bark, bite, or otherwise

disturb the peace usually end up in

Matthew Margolis’s Doggie Court, '

but in nearly all 'cases the owners,
' not the dogs, are found guilty.
Margolis, who owns the Nation-
al Institute of Dog Training in
Monterey Park, has been provid-
ing free counseling to owners of
bothersome dags since last spring,
when Deputy City Attorney Steven
Rood asked him to help solve an
escalating problem.

Sometimes both parties in a ca-

nine inspired dispute meet in the
deputy city attorney’s office and .
describe the problem to Margolis
over a speaker telephone. The dog
trainer is usually able to offer ad-
vice that is acceptable to every-
...one.

Most of the nearly 40 cases that
' have come to Doggie Court have
;~ involved the pooch that barks too

i much, Margolis said, but several

“5:: have resulted from complaints
'3 about dogs that escaped from their
7 yards and attacked people or other

‘ animals.

Maisie Evans, a spokeswoman

O’Connor, said the informal meet-
ings are meant to resolve the dis-
putes before they actually go to
court.

“It’s not an actual decision,”
she said of the arbitration. “It re-
lies on the good will of the people
involved.”

Margolis, who said he solved
dog problems by thinking like one,
refers to the city’s program as
“Doggie Court, Margolis Presid-
ing.”

He pointed out that the media-
tion approach has saved Beverly
Hills thousands of dollars in court
costs and untold hours of lawyer
time. He also said it has saved
money for the dog owners, who
could be fined, made to give up
their pets, forced to hire attorneys
to defend lawsuits —- or all three.

“You’re kind of like a detec—
tive,” he said. “I find out what the
problem is from the plaintiff. I
hear from the dog owner, who usu-
ally says, ‘It’s not that bad.’

“Then I interview the dog.”

The conversation with the dog
involves a series of tests that eval-
uate the animal’s rate of learning
and responsiveness. In all of his
cases, Margolis said he has never
found a dog whose behavior could
not be changed.

said most of the time the owners
are the cause of problem pets.

“What you need to do is have an
understanding of why dogs do the
things they do,” Margolis said.
“It’s kind of like the United Na-
tions. If you don’t have an inter-
preter, you’re dead.”

For instance, when a dog barks
at night, he said, it often may be
because the animal is lonely.
“Barking to them is natural and
biting is natural, but it’s not natu-
ral when you live in a society of
pe0p1e,” he said.

“You hear about dogs killing
children. It’s not an accident — 99
percent of this is preventable
through training.”

‘ Margolis belieVes mediation '
that helps educate owners in solv-
ing their pets’ problems is a solu-

, tion that all cities could use to help

settle the bothersome neighbor-
hood disputes that can evolve into
costly lawsuits.

“There were about a million dog
bites in the Unites States last
year,” he said. “That represents
about 1 percent of all hospital vis-
its.”

One of the problems Margolis
encounters is that when he talks to
owners about their dogs, they nev-
er believe their pet was “that
had,” even if someone has been
bitten.

 

“What most people say is, ‘He

u.‘

strangers.’ Well, you have about
240 million strangers in the United
States,” Margolis said. ,

Most of the complaints, he said,
can be traced back to owners who
have incorrectly trained their dog.

“People are very confused
about their dogs. It’s sad because
people want to do the right thing,” '
said Margolis, whose interest in
dogs goes back to age 3 when he
was bitten by his cousin’s cocker
spaniel.

“You’re dealing with pe0p1e’s
thoughts about how dogs think, in-
stead of what’s true.”

Despite the fact that most peo-
ple defend their dog’s behavior

better than they would their chil-

dren, Margolis said, the arbitra-
tion has always helped to find a so-
lution for the problem.

“You’ve got 45 million dog own-
ers in the United States, but they
don’t understand about raising .
and training them,” he said. “The
thought of training seems nega-
tive. The key is educating. I just

don’t want to solve the problem. If
you don’t educate the owner “eff

they’re just going to do what they l’.
want to anyway.”

: ”Cheetah

Photographed in Africa, the
number of cheetahs remaining
in the wild varies from 10,000
to 25,000 and their future is
also bleak.

medicinal claims of tiger parts are equally bogus. As
an example, tiger bone wine is thought to be a cure for
rheumatism. '

Even though the tiger has suffered a significant
decline in numbers over the past fifty years, this
species of wild cat has one of the brightest futures.
Former Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi set a shining
example of what even an impoverished country, such
as India, can do to protect endangered wildlife. When
approached by World Wildlife Fund representatives
about establishing a comprehensive tiger
conservation program, she responded by launching
Project Tiger. Mrs. Gandhi became actively involved
in the project devoting both time and money. The
number of tiger reserves doubled and more were
planned. The mission of the reserves was to not only
protect the tiger but also the species the tiger preys on,
and the habitat in general. Project Tiger now benefits
many of India’s wild animals including fourteen other
cat species and the forest they inhabit. But most
importantly, Project Tiger stimulated the public’s
imagination about nature conservation and is today a
major force in Indian politics. This would never have
happened without Indira Gandhi’s strong personal
commitment.

Since the inception of Project Tiger the number of
tigers in India has doubled. This type of endeavor
shows us what can be accomplished when a concerted
effort is mounted. It is important to note that Project
Tiger has only been successful because the efforts to
save wildlife were made in parallel with commitments
to upgrade the quality of life for the humans in the
area around the reserves. If a person is starving to
death they are not likely to care if another tiger is
shot; however, if you provide that same person with a
job, educate them, and show them why the tiger is an
important part of their world, they are likely to care a
great deal. We in developed countries often do not
understand how others can allow their wildlife to
decline; however, before we judge them too severely we
should remember that in the past century the jaguar
and margay have been eliminated from the United
States, and the ocelot is now extremely rare.

CATS MAGAZINE

 

 

A few last words: The future of the cheetah is
questionable. Although there are significant
populations of this cat in certain parts of Africa, their
numbers are still declining. Unlike the other large
cats the cheetah does not fare exceptionally well in
captivity. Conservatively, seventy-five percent of all
captive cheetahs die from liver and/or kidney
problems. No one knows if cheetahs in the wild suffer
from the same diseases. This must be determined if
this species is to be properly cared for. You can
participate in this “sacred stewardship” by
contributing to a project that will determine how
prevalent kidney and liver problems are in wild
cheetahs. By contributing $20.00 we’ll send you a

sheep or goats are introduced to the land, the natural
prey of the cheetah disappears and the cheetah is
forced to kill domestic animals. Humans then treat
the cheetah as a pest and hundreds are shot each year
by ranchers. For those cheetahs lucky enough to ﬁnd
natural game, many are killed when they accidentally
run into barbed wire fences during a chase. It seems
rather ironic that an animal that was once trained to
help with the hunt is now considered a pest by those
who knowingly take over its once abundant territory.

The dilemna of the margay is quite different from
that of the cheetah. It is the beautifully patterned fur
of this American spotted cat that will lead to its
ultimate demise. While the international fur trade of
tiger, snow leopard, leopard, and cheetah has been all
but banned, these same regulations have not been
extended to the two dozen species of small spotted
cats. Once common throughout Central America these
cats are now extinct over a large percentage of their
former range. Sheer numbers will explain why this
has happened. In 1976, over 750,000 wild cat skins
were imported into England and West Germany, and
of those approximately ninety percent were spotted
cats. Although an individual skin may net only $510
for the poacher, ﬁgures released in 1981 showed that a
margay jacket can fetch as much as $30,000 on the
black market.

The margay is an excellent climber, and is
matched only by the clouded leopard of Southeast
Asia in aerial skill. The margay’s claws are unusually

Siberian Tiger

There are more Siberian tigers

long and sharp, and its feet are extremely wide.
Weighing around eight pounds, the margay is often
mistaken for its larger cousin, the ocelot and smaller
cousins, the tiger cat, kodkod, and Geoffroy’s cat, all
of which occur in the margay’s range from Mexico to
Brazil. Because the margay can leap to the ground
without injury from very high branches, scientists
initially thought this species had a mental disorder.
This, of course, proved to be wrong and we now know
that the margay is quite simply adapted for life in the
trees. Like many tree-dwelling mammals, the margay
will spread all four feet when leaping from branch to
branch, and should even one paw contact a branch
that is sufficient for this species to grab and hold on.

Unfortunately, like many of the small wild cats,
the margay gives birth to litters of only one or two,
and thus the time required to replace animals lost to
poaching is lengthy. Like most of the spotted cats the
margay is nocturnal and is very difficult to observe;
however, poachers are wise to the margay’s habits
and most are caught at night in baited traps. For the
unfortunate individual that does not bleed to death,
strangulation at the hands of the poacher is the order
of the day.

The tiger is the largest of all living cats, with
males of the Siberian subspecies weighing up to 700
pounds and reaching a total length of thirteen feet.
The more common Bengal tiger weighs about 500
pounds. At the turn of the century eight subspecies of
tigers roamed from eastern Europe to Southeast Asia,
now only ﬁve are living and two of those are all but
extinct. With the exception of the Bengal subspecies
there are almost as many individuals in captivity as
in nature.

Over most parts of the tiger’s range their beautiful
coat has been their downfall. In India alone several
trophy hunters had killed more than a thousand tigers
each! By the late 19603 only about 2,000 tigers
remained in India. Even more unsettling than the
number of animals killed were the ways in which they
were killed. Because the skins were more valuable
when undamaged, tigers were often trapped and then
either drowned or strangled. When tigresses delivered
their litters in areas being cleared by burning, the
tigresses were shot and their scared young burnt to
death. In all cases, it appears that very little sport was
involved in these slayings.

The tiger has been feared throughout recorded
history, yet documents from ancient Chinese cultures
claim that tigers were trained to help in the fields. For
the Chinese, the tiger has always symbolized vigorous
character and courageous spirit. Unfortunately, this
adoration also contributes to the animal’s decline, for
many people believe that medicines made from the
tiger have special rejuvenating properties. Like the
purposed properties of the rhinoceros horn, the

WHEN ONLY A PICTURE
REMAINS—page 14

Northern Hemisphere from Europe to North America.
Up until about 11,000 years ago lions freely roamed in
the United States. The North American lion was a
giant, almost twenty-five percent larger than African
lions. Like its African cousin, the North American
lion apparently lived in social groups as evidenced by
its larger brain. The North American lion’s
contemporary, the saber-toothed cat, had a small
brain and was probably non-social like the modern
puma and jaguar.

The process of extinction of lions in North
America, Europe and most of Asia is not entirely
clear. Humans were definitely present in those areas
at the time the lions disappeared. Recent scientific
studies suggest that humans could have eliminated
the large cats’ prey species, like the mammoths, and
this would certainly have contributed to the extinction
of the lion and saber-toothed cat. Later extermination
of the lion in India, and North and South Africa were
the direct result of the relentless hunting by humans.
The most recent declines in lion populations are due to
indirect human pressures such as overgrazing in
areas which will not longer support the natural prey
species of the lion. With overgrazing the land can no

the last refuge for the Asian lion. Unless overgrazing
is stopped, the Asian subspecies of lion will be lost
forever in the wild.

Thirty-six other species of wild cats still roam this
planet. Each is beautiful and unique in its own way,
and consequently, each has its own survival problems
in relation to human beings, the wild cats’ principal
predator. Here we’ll examine three other wild cats, the
cheetah, margay, and tiger.

We all know the cheetah to be the fastest mammal
in the world. It can easily attain speeds up to seventy
miles per hour. Special internal structures that enable
fast pursuit include an oversized heart, lungs, air
passages, as well as long slender legs and specialized
muscles for rapid acceleration. At one time the
cheetah’s distribution was second only to the lion,
occurring throughout Asia, Western Europe, and
North America. Kublai Khan once stabled over 1,000
cheetahs at his summer palace, some of which were
trained to hunt, much like modern domestic hunting
dogs. Yet, even during the cheetah’s heyday this
species was only sparsely distributed throughout its
range. Scientists now believe that this low population
density may have made the cheetah an easy target for
humans and helped contribute to this species ultimate
decline.

The cheetah hunts in open grassland. It does not
stalk its prey like a lion, but instead charges its prey
at high speed from distances up to 200 yards. If the
cheetah is unable to pull down the prey within the
next few hundred yards, the pursuit will stop. Whether
or not a chase is successful, a cheetah will be
incapable of another sprint for at least thirty minutes.
Prey is often dragged into cover, for because the
cheetah is a solitary hunter, it cannot defend its meal
from hyenas, lions, or even determined vultures.

Cheetah cubs are born blind and helpless but
develop more quickly than any of the other large wild
cats. A week from birth their eyes are Open and by two
weeks they begin to walk. Unlike most newborn
mammals, young cheetahs are darker on their belly,
showing conspicuous silver fur along their head and
back. It is believed that this color combination
protects the young cheetahs from other animals in
that the pattern mimics the African honey badger,
one of the most ferocious of all animals. Although
small, about twenty-ﬁve pounds, honey badgers have
been known to inﬂict serious wounds in animals the
size of cape buffalo. Potential predators thus may shy
away from the young cheetahs assuming them to be
honey badgers. Unfortunately, the most serious
predator of cheetahs, the human being, is not
confused.

The open grassland the cheetah inhabits is
considered to be prime grazing land. Once cattle,

Mountain Lion

The largest of cats still in
North America. Proposed
opening of a trophy hunting
season on mountain lions by
the California Fish and
Game Commission is being
vehemently protested by the
Mountain Lion Coalition.

The wild cats are all but gone. One often
wonders what it will take to shock us to our senses.
Perhaps if all the lions died and we were only able to
show our grandchildren pictures of this magnificent
animal, and were forced to explain to them why they
no longer roamed freely on this planet . . . perhaps
then we would learn our lesson. Hopefully this
scenario will never happen.

Wild cats are native to every continent except
Australia and Antarctica. They inhabit almost every
environment, from steamy tropical jungles to the
bitter frozen tundra. Like all carnivores, and like all
other hunters, wild cats help keep animal populations
in natural balance.

The wild cats can be divided into two generic
groups, the small and big cats, yet size alone does not
determine the placement of individual species. As an
example, the snow leopard and puma, both small cats
are actually larger than the leopard, a big cat. The big
cats, the lion, tiger, jaguar, and leopard can all “roar”.
This very loud, resonant vocalization is a well-known
feature of the big cats and is accomplished by a
specialized elastic ligament in the voice box. Small
cats do not have this ligament and thus cannot roar.
Purring was once thought to be a characteristic of
only the small cats; however, tame Cheetahs, tigers
and leopards do purr in response to attention.
Apparently the big cats can only purr while exhaling
whereas the small cats can also purr while inhaling.
Only a few other characteristics consistently separate

CATS MAGAZINE

the big and small cats. Big cats tend to groom only
their paws and faces, and eat lying down, whereas
small cats groom their entire body and eat crouched
over their food.

Regardless of size, all species of wild cat are
threatened with extinction. Whereas a few species
have adapted their ways to the presence of humans,
as a group the wild cats ﬂourish only in the natural
world a world without human encroachment. Those
species that are the least demanding of their habitat
have fared the best. Yet, even the versatile leopard,
the least endangered of the big cats, has shown a
significant decline in numbers over the past few
decades.

As with all wild animals, habitat destruction and
the subsequent inﬂux of humans into those areas has
been the major factor contributing to the demise of the
wild cats. Every day 35,000 acres of rain forest alone
are destroyed. Annually that equates to an area three
times the size of Massachusetts being eliminated.
Replacement of that lost habitat is not possible, and
all of the wildlife, including the wild cats, perish.
Being driven out of prime habitat is not something
new for the wild cats, and the lion illustrates this
point most clearly.

The present distribution of the lion is but a
remnant of its range in the recent past. At one time
lions had the largest distribution of any wild cat,
occurring not only in Africa, but also across the entire

. Has Airport Owner
solved Bird Problem?

By SIMON SCHWARTZ
For GRIT

As one of only a handful of
female airport owners in the
Midwest, Josephine Richardson
already sticks out in the crowd.
But now, she has come up with
a project which has gained her

even wider notoriety.
Richardson, of Decatur, Ind.,
is interested not only in airp-
lanes and is a long-time pilot,
but also in birds —- especially in
catching birds which are a bin-
drance to her operation. The
biggest pests are sparrows,

starlings and pigeons.
' Birds caused heavy damage
to some of her planes so she
began developing a plan to get

_ rid, of them. She designed a bird

trap made of metal, and is now
selling the device all over the

United States and Canada,”

mostly to airplane owners. The
traps sell for $30 and in two
months this spring she sold 150
of them. Recently, two traps
were purchased by the
Advanced Nuclear Fuel Con-
trols Company at the large
atomic complex at Richland,
Wash. -
Mrs. Richardson employs tw
men, one from Indiana and one
from Ohio, to build the traps;
she and her husband, Wes, pack
them for shipment. No trap
leaves the Richardson Airport
without her inspection first,

Mrs. Richardson continually ,
stresses. _.

She can ’t ham it up anymore

LUMBERTON, N.C. (AP) —
' Norma Jean, the 600-pound pig who
sipped champagne and ate expen-
sive chocolates at her coming-out
party attended by 400 formally at-
tired people, has died.
Veterinarian N.G. Baird told the
Fayetteville Times that Norma “J ean
died April 30, more than two
months short of her third birthday.
The cause of death was not immedi-
ately available.

Her owner, Dr. Raymond Sat-
tler, a neurosurgeon, was attending
a medical convention in Dallas and
could not be reached for comment.
- . “Norma Jean has been sick re-

' cently and was unable to stand,”
said Dr. Victor Keranen, one of Sat-
tler’s colleagues. -

The Sattlers kept the pig in their
home and, in March 1986, held a
black-tie, invitation-only, RSVP deb-

utante party for Norma Jean at the
Ramada Inn in Lumberton.

Norma Jean and the Sattlers ar-
rived at the motel in a limousine
amid spotlights and the beam of
television camera lights.

About 400 guests, wearing tuxe-
dos, furs and evening gowns, attend-
ed the party, described by some as
a night of swine and roses. Norma
Jean reclined on a couch, sipping
champagne and chewing on Godiva
chocolates as she was admired by
her guests.

“It was the talk of the town, and
some people who didn’t get invited
felt left out,” said Kenneth Norton,
the motel’s desk manager.

But Norton said the fame never
went to Norma Jean’s head.

“She behaved like a lady,” he
said.

SOMETHING ABOUT
NANCY BELSER

' BUBS ANIMALS THE
RIGHT WAY '

Every time Michael Tomlin thinks
about it, he’s moved to testify. “It’s al-
most like those healers on TV who get
crippled people to throw their crutches
away,” says the Nashville investor.
Tomlin’s 6-year-old German Shepherd
had a bad hip after being hit by a truck,
but after a few sessions with mas-
seuse Nancy Belser, Scarlet is jumping
around like a 3-month-old puppy.
“Nancy is the Earnest Angley of the
animal world,” says Tomlin.

Belser laughs at the comparison
with televangelist Angley, but not at
the efficacy of massage. The 32-year-
old masseuse has developed quite a
following in Nashville by treating dogs,
cats, horses and even pigs for a variety
of ailments, including bruises, sore-
ness, arthritis, lethargy and hyperactiv-
ity. “A good massage is equivalent to a
three-mile walk,” says Belser, who
charges $25 a session and makes
house calls. “Everything loves to be
touched.” She had been giving thera-
peutic rubdowns to athletes in her
hometown, Chapel Hill, N.C., when her
pig landed a role in a local production
of L’ilAbner. Noticing that the pig “was
under a lot of stress from being on-
stage,” as she puts it, Belser discov-
ered that her massage techniques
worked just as well on hogs. She began
offering her services—first to humans,
then their animals—after she moved
to Nashville in 1985. Single and living
with three cats, she now counts such
country music luminaries as Rosanne
Cash, Hillary Kanter and their respec-
tive pets as clients.

While nearly everyone sings Belser’s
praises, at least one of her patrons
feels that a revitalized dog isn’t always
a good thing. Paula Sloan’s Peppy, 15,
is living up to his name after being
treated for sluggishness and arthritis.
“But at his age, his bladder control
isn’t too good,” says Sloan. “Now I’ve
got him running all over the house.” El

 

Belser massages a 3-month-old client,

vhen you call her”) Vanderbilt.

 




houses of horror — where pigs are dumped ,
into scalding tanks while still alive, terri-

fied cattle are paralyzed from the neck '
down by severing their spines, and sheep

die slow agonizing

deaths after being

 

stabbed in the throat, reveal shocked eye-

witnesses.

And the atrocities don’t
end with those monstrous
practices. Bound animals
are callously tossed out of
the back of trucks, slam-
ming to the hard ground
. . . sheep are blinded be-
fore being slaughtered
. . . and the horns of cattle
are chopped off with
cleavers, causing excruci-
ating pain. ‘

The story of these ani-
mals’ suffering will break
your heart — but it’s a story
that must be told before the
torture can ever be stopped.

“Conditions in Mexico’s
slaughterhouses are deplora-
ble!” storms a furious John
Walsh, Boston regional di—
rector for the World Society
for the Protection of Ani-
mals (WSPA).

“The preslaughter han-
dling of animals is cruel,
primitive, even barbaric —
and the methods are the
same in all the Mexican
plants I’ve visited.

“At a plant in Guadalaja-
ra, I saw sheep with their
legs tied together being
thrown off the back of a
truck without the tailgate
even being drapped.

“After they were thrown
off, the sheep were stacked
almost like cords of wood.”

Walsh said 110-volt elec-
tric prods, connected to a
wall socket, were being used
to hurry cattle along chutes.
One worker admitted the
shock kills some cattle.

The US. government re- .

quires the stunning of ani-
mals before slaughter, using
humane devices that knock
out the animals in a fraction
of a second.

The U.S. government also
carefully regulates killing
and meat handling practices
at the handful of Mexican-
slaughterhouses allowed to
export meat to the U.S. But
the majority of the other
slaughterhouses don’t have
any strict regulation — and
that’s why the abuses are

number about 1,200. Veteri-

will pierce the eyes of cattle
and pigs, so they can’t see,
before their throats are cut.”

Dr. Aluja said eyewit-
nesses have told her cattle
are sometimes doused with
gasoline and set afire to
stampede them down ramps.

At one slaughterhouse vis-
ited by Temple Grandin, a
research assistant at the
University of Illinois animal
sciences department, sheep
were being killed simply by
stabbing them in the throat
and letting them slowly
bleed to death, she said.

If the cattle’s horns were
too long for them to easily
pass through a‘ single-file
chute into the slaughter-
house, the horns were back-
ed off, said Grandin, an in-
ternationally known consul-
tant on livestock handling
facilities.

Little Butch the terrier was defi-

-— until he became a hero by saving the
life of his 93-year-old mistress.

Now Butch is top dog —- ..

and winner of the annual

“hero dog” award from the
Los Angeles Society for the

Prevention of Cruelty to Ani- ‘

mals.

The tiny 3-year-old pooch
which had a history of mischievous-
ness -— raised the alarm after el-
derly Nellie Johnston was seriously
injured at her Los Angeles home in
February.

Nellie had gotten up at 5:30 to
make coffee —- then collapsed in the
kitchen.

Two big watchdogs in the house
snoozed on while Nellie lay bleeding
from head and face wounds and in-
ternal injuries.

The kitchen door was closed, but .
Butch sensed that Nellie was in'

trouble and so he frantically tried

to wake up her two sleeping grand;

daughters, Leslie, 24, and Ann, 28'

“He ran from my bedroom to]
Ann’s bedroom barking furiously;
leaping on our beds and yelping in

out until 1 am. and just wanted to

quite a way apart and he would

Then I could hear the sound of his
feet as he would race to my bed-
room, where he’d leap on my bed
and bark at me.

“In between he would scratch at

’ the kitchen door and whine.”

Ann, who’d been out until 4 am,
told The ENQUIRER, “I kept trying
to ignore him.

“Then I thought maybe he wanted
to get outside.

“Eventually I got up and went to
the front door to let him out. But he
wouldn’t go. He kept jumping up

and then running a few steps from

 

 

me. It was obvious he wanted me to

follow him.

“When he reached the kitchen
door, he kept jumping up and throw:

open it.

The sisters called paramedics who
rushed Nellie to the hospital, where
she spent almost three weeks in in-

tensive care.
“The doctors told us that we’d

found her in the nick of time," said
Leslie.

“If she hadn’t been found she:

GRIT 27

Adopt-a-Deer Project Launched by EcolOgist

By DON DAVENPORT
For GRIT

VETERAN researcher

at the University of

Wisconsin-Madison is

"eeking funds by offer-

ing citizens and groups a

chance to “adopt” a northern
Wisconsin deer,

The funds would help wildlife

ecologist Orrin Rongstad gather

information about deer survival
in that area of the state and the
factors that influence it.

“In the 19303 our study area
in northern Wisconsin had one
of the highest deer densities in

the nation,” says Rongstad.
“Today it has one of the lowest
population densities in Wiscon-
sin. We think the number of
deer in this and other areas of
the state could be higher. To
determine if this is so, we need
to find out what factors are
keeping deer numbers down.”

Rongstad proposes putting
radio transmitters on at least
100 animals and following them
for three, years. The university
has supplied $10,000 to get the
project going. With that money,
Rongstad and his students have
trapped 34 deer and fitted them

with transmitters.

“It takes about $300 to cap-
ture a deer, put a radio on it
and track it for a year,” says
Rongstad. The ecologist said he
approached the Department of
Natural Resources for help, but
they had no funds available for
his project. He now hopes to
interest private citizens in the
research.

Each individual or group that
contributes $300 will be notified

about “their” deer’s age and.

sex, and where it was caught or

indicate the chances that hun-
ters will shoot an adopted deer
are not as likely as it might
seem. Rongstad’s students put
transmitters On 14 deer before
last fall’s hunting season. All of
them escaped hunters, includ-
ing two eight-point bucks and
one nine-point buck. “We hope
to come up with some insight
into how these big bucks man-
age to avoid hunters so effec-
tively,” says Rongstad.

“Two of the 34 deer we’ve ﬁt-
ted with transmitters have
already died,” he remarked.
“One was killed by a car, and
we suspect a poacher took the
other.”

"Rongstad wants to find out if
northern Wisconsin can supply
enough food in summer and

feeding increases deer survival
and reproduction. Some of the

deer that are currently tagged

wintered in areas up to 15 miles
from their summer range.

The researchers will follow
deer from four groups -— those
that get no supplemental feed-
ing, those that get additional
food in summer only, those that
get additional food in winter
only, and those that get food in
both summer and winter.

One reason Rongstad needs to
track so many animals is that
deer behavior can be highly
individualistic. Last winter, one
deer with a transmitter lived
within a mile of a feeding site
but didn’t visit it, while another
lived two miles from the feeder
and came to feed several timess.

$5,000 for Honeymoon
Sacrificed to Save a Cat

United Press International

. North Providence, RI.

A 39-year-old first-grade
teacher dropped her honey-

, moon plans after she paid $5,000

in medical bills to save an alien--
doned 7-1nonth‘old kitten that

‘ had suffered severe burns.

“Life is very precious, even for
a little animal that can’t talk,” said
Janet Ciampanelli after she com-
mitted her honeymoon travel mon»
ey to paying Ernie 5 medical bills.
She will be married June 28.

The impish, greeneyed tiger
kitten was abandoned at the Coven-
try Animal Hospital, where Ciampa-
nelli works as a volunteer. Ernie’s
haunches were burned by what vet
erinarians speculated was scalding
water.

“I couldn’t put him to sleep,"
Ciampanelli said. “Have you ever
felt something compelling that you
just had to do? I looked at those
little eyes and the love and the trust.

“I had moments of guilt when I
saw him in pain,” she continued.

“But I’ll tell you something about
animals ~—— they forget the past. We”

hang onto our pasts and our hang

ups. A little kitten forgives and for .

gets."

Ernie underwent skin grafts 2:

andplastic surgery at the Tufts New
England Veterinary Medical Center
in Grafton, Mass. lie was confined
to an incubator for seven weeks.

Then Ernie joined Ciampanel-
li’sfive other cats and her dog at her
North Providence home.

Ciampanelli said her fiance
agreed their honeymoon money
was better spent on Ernie.

In Praise of Pets

As a nurse, I was pleased to see your
report on how pets have a positive effect
on mental and physical health [March'
30]. I make weekly visits to nursing
homes, where elderly residents who are
often disoriented become more alert and
responsive after a few minutes with my
dog. The unconditional love given by the
animal helps to counteract the isolation
and loneliness and makes an otherwise
routine day different.

Brenda H. Stone
Baltimore

I am 85 years old, and have lived
alone for years. At times when I have
awakened and been terribly depressed, I
have immediately felt better if my cat
crawled onto my lap. Tiger and I are
proof that pets alleviate loneliness. ‘

Lappin, the 29-year-old commer-

accessory mail-order company,
Whimsey, evolved into the bou-
tique and bakery.

Happy Tails customers are
“empty-nesters, yuppies, families,
someone who cares about their an-
imals and wants something out of
the ordinary for them.” Lappin is
such a pet owner. “Elke is like my
child,” she says. “And the more I
researched things for my animal,
the more I became upset about the
quality of products.”

Thus, the bakery, where veteri-
nary assistant Shannon McKinnon

The bone-shaped biscuits contain
whole-wheat flour, eggs, milk,
margarine and a natural chicken,

ARIZONA REPLHSLIC-PHOENIX — 4/23/87

Jason Rambler, 11, and his sister, Sarah, 8, hug Oreo after the
shaggy dog's rescue at Letchworth State Park near Castiie, NY.

A real shaggy-dog story:

Oreo retrieved from gorge

Assbclated Press

CASTILE, N.Y. —— A shaggy dog
that fell 75 feet into a gorge was
safe Wednesday after park employ-
ees ignored a no-rescue policy,
much to the delight of the dog’s
ll-year-old owner, officials said.

Jason Rambler was playing with
his dog, Oreo, on Monday in
Letchworth State Park when, the
65-pound dog broke her leash and
jumped a stone fence blocking off
the gorge.

“Oreo went sailing through the
air and into the gorge,” said Jason’s
mother, Margaret Rambler, whose
family was having a picnic at the
park about 45 miles east of Buffalo.

“We thought she would be killed.
We told the park people about it,
and they said that they do 'not

attempt to rescue pets that fall into
the gorge.”

But Oreo survived and was
spotted on a ledge about 75 feet
down the 20(Moot gorge.

By Tuesday morning, park offi-
cials relented, and Judy Draper, a
Genesee State Park police officer
and Jon Kelly, a park employee,
lowered themselves into the gorge
by rope. _‘ ,

Oreo was attached to a harness
and hoisted out of the gorge. The
rescue took nearly four hours.

“We generally don’t try to rescue
animals,” said Ronald Foley, Gene-

see Park Commission manager.,

“But because the family was close

 

by and because we could use it as a

training exercise, we did it.”

Bob, a pit bull, injured Miss Cade after
breaking free from his chain.

Dog to pay
for attacks ’
With his life
or liberty

By Lawrence Buser
Staff Reporter

 

 

Bob was declared a vicious dog by the
city yesterday, and it may cost him his
life -- or at least life in a pen.

The ll-month-old pit bull owned by
Terry Hugghis of 331 Flynn received that
label in a hearing at the Memphis Animal
Shelter, where he has been held since he
broke his chain and bit a young neighbor
on April 15. '

“He just bit and held on, and he started
shaking my leg real hard,” said 12-year-
old Valencia Cade, who underwent sur-
gery after she was bitten on the left
thigh. “Then a boy hitlhim in the head
with a 2-by-4 and he just fell out.”

Miss Cade, a straight-A student at Dou-
ble Tree Elementary, still was wearing a
plastic pink hospital bracelet, and her

OMMERCIAL APPEAL — 4/29/87

thigh was wrapped in thick gauze.

Interim shelter director Sue Thurmon
and field supervisor Ron Cleaves de-
clared the dog vicious based on that at-‘
tack and another last month in which
Bob bit another girl’s ponytail and
scratched her on the back.

They ruled that Hugghis must post a
warning sign and build a secure holding
pen for the animal. He was given until
12:30 pm. today to decide whether he will
comply with that order or offer an accept-
able alternative. Otherwise, Ms. Thur-
mon said, Bob will be “humanely put to
death.” '

“I want you to understand the severity
of what has happened," she told Hugghis,
who has two days in which he may appeal
the ruling to Public Service Director
Cynthia Buchanan.

In Bob’s defense, Hugghis said Miss
Cade and another child were teasing the
dog with a stick several days before the
attack occurred. .

 

“He probably still-”remembered: that when the

g incident happened,” said Hugghis, who bought
, the brown, SS—‘pound dog as a pup from a breeder

for $150. “They had been warned time and time
again not to come back in the back yard because
they knew what was back there.

“I do know what he is capable of, but I didn’t get
him to roam the neighborhood and attack kids. I’m
just really getting him as a good watchdog and
good guard dog because there have been some
burglaries in the neighborhood.”

Hugghis, who recently lost his job, said later yes-
terday he hoped the shelter will allow him to keep
Bob in a back-yard pen at his cousin’s home on
Semmes. A decision on that request will be made
today.

Cleaves said that since last May, 481 dog bites
have been reported in Memphis, including 43 by
pit bulls, which, along with Dobermans and Ger-
man shepherds, usually inflict the most severe
bites.

Nationwide, pit bulls have been responsible for
three fatal attacks this year and seven of the 13 fa-
tal dog attacks last year, although they represent
less than 2 percent of the total dog population.
Some cities have launched efforts to ban them.

Cleaves said that in the past year several pit bull
owners have brought their dogs in, saying they
could no longer control them. Last year the
shelter decided it would no longer adopt out pit
bulls because of their aggressive nature. ‘

There have been no fatal pit bull attacks in Mem-

 

phis, but Cleaves said there is growing concern.

~In the Reign of
Dogs and Cats

THIS IS INTELLIGENT. This is truly smart and
wonderful. Delta District Puppy Lovers, upset
because living doggies and kitties are used in
medical experiments, think it’s a good idea to
burn down a UC Davis veterinary laboratory.

This laboratory (should it ever be finished;
there’s a $2.5 million shortfall very likely because
of puppy passion) would have been used to diag-
nose animal diseases. Bunnies and gerbils would
have been returned to health because of the
services offered in this building.

Ah, but returned to health in a corrupt soci-
ety where living kitties are used in medical re-
search. The line must ———-—

Of course, the Pup- Sp GCLCSf or

their vote for burning Itself

down another build-
ing. They could say it .
would be nice to burn down the local SPCA,
where kitties are put to death every day of the
year, just killed dead without any useful infor-
mation being derived.

The kitties have to die because there is no one
to feed them. They have to die because the people
who claim to really care about kitties are too busy
burning down science buildings to educate the
populace at large about the necessity of steriliza-
tion for household pets.

Or they could opt for burning down the local
fast-food outlet, where dead cows are grilled and
eaten 18 hours a day. Presumably, those cows
would rather have remained uneaten; that would
have been an extremely liberating experience, in
the terms that a cow can understand.

But probably such a cleansing fire would not
gather public support. Hamburger joints and the
SPCA are part of the sympathetic continuum.
The University of California, sadly, is not.

life against a human baby, I don’t know what I’d

feels the same way. It doesn’t blame me; I don’t

OW, SUPPOSE THE only way a cure for AIDS

could be found was by killing animals. I
would support the killing of animals without

1f 10,000 kitties had had to be sacrificed to pre-
vent those deaths, it would be somewhat sad but
mostly happy.

And that is the brutal neceSsity of medical
research: It is necessary to use living tissue to
studythe progress of disease. It is necessary to
examine the living tissue, which means killing

. ’ Just one planet here; we feed on each other;
it s a circle of fixed dimensions. Certainly those
who use animals for research should be monitor-

ATLANTA JOURNAL - May 4, 1987

Animals blessed _ '
in an observance
of special week

By Robert Berry
Staff Writer

 

In the spirit of the Feast of St. Francis,‘ usually
held in October, the blessing of the pets was held
Sunday at the‘Atlanta Humane Society to commemo-
rate Be Kind to Animals Week, one of the nation’s
oldest weeklong observations. .

“After all, it says in Genesis that animals are put
here to be given names, to be taken seriously, and to
be taken care of. By doing that, you make them spe-
cial to God,” said the Rev. Thad B. Rudd of 'The
Church of Our Saviour in Atlanta. 'In floor-length
vestments and a high-church berretta cap, the Epis-
cOpal minister sprinkled the small crowd, pets and
owners alike, with holy water from a gold aspergil-
lum.

The parking lot behind the city’s 114-year-old‘

charity became the scene of one of the more prosaic
tasks in Rudd’s ministry. There, he blessed a Labra—
dor named Cody, a Methodist beagle named Buford
and almost a dozen other dogs, as well as a cat and
three of Atlanta’s youngest residents, held in a box
by John Keith.

“Mew,” said Sister.

Brothers Bear and Stinker, perhaps the more de-
vout of the litter of kittens, remained silent.

“I think they‘ll be easier to!
place if I have the advertisement
read ‘previously blessed,"’ said
Keith.

Amid the barking of the 175
dogs and 25 cats -— the semiperma-
nent residents —— at the society, the
small congregation of Atlanta’s
faithful dogs and cats were accom-
panied by their owners (or mem-
bers of the Humane Society if or-
phaned) and blessed by Rudd under 9
May’s misty skies. I

But not before he asked that Al'- ‘

because PeOpIe magazine and the scandal-mongering

g supermarket tabloids seldom get out into the booni es.

7 One such story recently trickled out of the rural
‘ community of Allegan, Mich, where they don’t bother
to roll up the sidewalks at sunset because not every-

, body has a sidewalk.

. This story concerned sex, promiscuity and rumored
threats of death. And it became the talk of little Alle—
.gan.

It began one night when Rasetus stayed out all night

” and came home at dawn looking pleased with himself.

Rasetus is the name of a large, good-natured Labra-
dor retriever owned by Kurt and Lisa Bale.

The Bales suspected what Rasetus had been doing
that night. What they didn’t know was with whom he
had been doing it.

_ They later found out.
Nearby lives Eugene Nally, who splices telephone
, cables for a living.

,I Nally owns a female dog named Missy, of which he

; .. is very proud and protective.

That’s because Missy is a purebred, registered

’ American water spaniel, which is quite a rare breed.

.. .,... , .. «.7
“unﬁt w“ . ': ' -.~f~;.., W 4

They are prized by bold hunters- who shoot birds from
the sky and send a dog to fetch the feathered crea-
tures’ carcasses.

Every so often, when Missy is feeling amorous, Mr.
Nally introduces her to a worthy male water spaniel.
The result of these encounters usually results in a lit-
ter of tiny water spaniels which Mr. Nally sells for as
much as $500 each.

That’s why Mr. Nally is protective of Missy. He
keeps a wire fence around her because he doesn’t want
Missy making the acquaintance of would-be suitors
who are, so to speak, from the wrong side of the genet-

 

r____

merely doing what comes naturally

'ic tracks.

But apparently the fence wasn’t tall enough. Not for
a determined young fellow like Rasetus. The night he
wandered, he leaped the fence.

And poor Mr. Nally was shocked when he came out
of his house that morning and found Rasetus keeping
company, so to Speak, with Missy.

He was even more shocked when Missy later deliv-
ered up 11 puppies. They were cute and frisky. And by
Mr. Nally’s calculations, they should have been worth
.no less than $2,200 —- had they a respectable father.

But because Rasetus is either a pure Labradoryif

you believe his owner, or a mongrel, if you believe the ~
angry Mr. Nally, they weren’t worth the price of a.

case of dog food.

So, Mr. Nally took the unusual legal step of asking
the County of Allegan to compensate him for his and
Missy’s loss. He asked to be paid from a fund that has

' been set up to compensate owners of livestock harmed
by stray dogs.

The county commissioners pondered his request,
then denied it. They reasoned that Missy, as valuable
as she is, is not livestock. And, they said, she had not
been harmed. If anything. she had been a willing par-
ticipant in the ill-fated romp with the dashing Rasetus.

Mr. Nally disagreed. When a reporter asked him
about the incident, he said: “That male dog just broke
in there.”

Are you saying that Missy was raped?

 

M

“Basically, yes”

The Bales, of course, disagree and say the fault is as
much Missy’s as Rasetus’, that she probably ﬂirted
and encouraged him. »

“He has normal male instincts, you know,” said
Mrs. Bale.

She also said: “Nally called and said if Rasetus ever
went near Missy again, he would shoot him.”

This was angrily denied by Mr. Nally, especially
when a local paper printed the story and got the whale
town buzzing. “I never threatened to shoot anybody
and1 I will sue for slander if anybody says I did,” he
sai . ~

Ah, but you have said that Rasetus was no better
thanf a rapist, which is a rather serious accusation in
itse .

“Well, it wasn’t Missy’s fault. She couldn’t get out of
her pen.”

But don’t you think she consented?

“She had pups, didn’t she?”

Curious about this sort of thing, I asked a dog expert
to tell me about the characteristics of the two breeds.

Of Missy’s breed, he said that besides their retriev-
ing talents, they are “enthusiastic and eager to
please.”

And Rasetus: “They get along with just about any-
body. And they are very active.”

Despite what Mr. Nally says, it sounds like a match
made in heaven.

 

 




 

DAYTON DAILY NEWS/JOURNAL HERALD - 4/22/87

All breeds of dogs are a problem this county

Sen. Neal Zimmers’ sponsorship of a bill
that zeroes in on pit bull dogs is a worth-
less gesture. -

Similar to our three Montgomery Coun-
ty commissioners, he is avoiding and with-
holding the detail that Ohio’s dog licenses
are anything other than a collection-fee
tax. Ohio has no specified tools for correc-
tive actions.

In my residential area a neighbor har-
bors two large dogs of unknown breeding.
That family disclaims ownership, although
the dogs have been corrupting my home
area for at least three years. . . I can’t get
any legally determined assistance.

Now, I have cause to be really angry.
Why is Sen. Zimmers predisposed to pit
bull dogs when his office knows that dog
wardens have not authority? And why are
Montgomery County Commissioners
Moon, Macllwaine and Curran ignoring
the residential spread throughout the coun-
ty? As the owner of a licensed dog that is
always restrained, I am only paying a tax
which has no value. And further, were this
tax updated and converted into a “leash
law.” wouldn’t it be more applicable to all
Ohio areas?

VIVIAN DeANGULO

Too many. dogs roaming neighborhoods.

I am concerned about the recent tragedy
that involved pit bulldogs. I think the time
is here to reinforce the policy of keeping all
dogs pinned up and not be allowed to roam
freely.

In my own neighborhood there are dogs
that roam around at will. They harass all
pedestrians they do not know. They let me

alone, but they really scare other people
who do not know what the dogs are going
to do.

I want the privilege of walkingfreely
with my two grandchildren without wor.
rying about being attacked by these
animals. . . .

Citizens should review all city’s ordinances

Is it not ludicrous that Dayton city ordi-
nances can march people off to jail because
of a lack of house paint, but have such a
great lack of definitiveness when it comes
to the taking of human life by vicious
dogs? '

Pit bulls are not domesticated pets. They
were not bred to be so and should not be
considered as such. There are stringent
rules for the keeping of stallions, breeding
bulls and wild animals. Should not dogs

and other animals bred to be attackers fall
under those same rules? ,

Before our esteemed commissioners
dump another ordinance on the town, we
need a good review of all ordinances with a
lot of citizen input. Let us avoid coming up

with more inequities against decent citi- '
zens such as the home mechanics and cur- ‘

rent property ordinances have
spawned... ' i

SACRAMENTO —- Not too long
ago, when dogs were bred for spe—
ciﬁc purposes and cats were kept
to catch mice, our pets not only
went to work, they had work to
do.

But today’s pets provide mostly
companionship, and they spend
long, lonely days in the house or
yard, waiting for their owners to
come home from work.

Rare are the pets that spend
most of their time with the owners
they adore; this is a story about
some of the fortunate.

La Fu Naw, a young Chinese I

Shar-Pei at Sean’s Diamonds in
Sacramento, may be named after a
tigress, but she’s quiet as a mouse.
So much so, in fact, that many
customers never notice her.

But you can be sure she notices
them.

Fu rests‘ behind the half-door

that separates the showroOm from:
the employee area, a door with ‘

just enough space underneath it

for her to keep an eye —— or more .

speciﬁcally, a nose —— on things.

That’s all an observant customer .

can see of Fu, for the ‘most part -—-
her nose, and her perfectly
matched pink toenails.

“She likes it there because she
can watch,” said her owner, Virgil
Woodhouse, who works at the
store. “She’s real good about it.
She just settles in, out of my way,
and keeps an eye on things.”

Such good manners are rare
enough in a grown dog. But Fu is
less than six months old, and she’s
been a shop regular since the age
of seven weeks.

“My roommate raises Shar-

"' .have’aboutwlo of them around the

Fu reinforces his statement by}
waggmg her tail leWIy but steadi~ _‘

1y as he speaks, pushing up the
wrinkles on her brow so she can
peer up at her owner. The dog is

. fond of the people 1n the shop, and

fuss overher. But she is, most def-
initely, Woodhouse’s dog.

Interior designer Dennis Haw—

is a well groomed, well mannered
miniature schnauzer named Truf-
fle. ‘

Her friends call her Truff, but.

she’s also got a name mom in

Haworth splits his time between

 

his business interests in San Fran-
cisco and Sacramento. When he
goes, Trufﬂe goes too; '

travel a lot, so I decided it would

be a dog I could take with me.”

tions to her partner, Georgie (a. k. a.

' Hair Machine).

“Georgie has certain faVorite
customers,’ said store owner Peter
Keat. “He’ll follow people around

and demand to be petted. He loves 1

And people, for the most part,
love him, according to Keat.

felony charges
in dog attacks

By Jim Schaefer
commas BUREAU

COLUMBUS -— Owners of dogs clas-
sified as “vicious” could be charged
with fourth-degree felonies and their
dogs could be destroyed for violations
_ of a bill that passed the Ohio House of
Representatives Wednesday. .
Owners who are so charged could
‘ get up to five years in prison and fined
up to $2,500,“ said Rep. Robert Hickey,
D-Dayton, the bill’s primary sponsor.
The minimum prison term for the felo-
ny charge is 18 months, Hickey said.

The bill, which will be sent to the
Senate, states the felony charges and
the dog’s destruction could be ordered

' if owners of vicious dogs violate cer-
tain confinement provisions. , >

A vicious dog is defined as one that
kills or seriously injures any person or
other animal.

Sen. Neal Zimmers, D-Dayton, intro- ‘

duced similar legislation in the Ohio
f Senate in February. Zimmers’ bill
: would allow county commissioners to

However, the chairman of the com-
mittee hearing Zimmers’ bill said

Wednesday he believes the bill is un- _

conStitutional because it restricts a sin-
gle breed. Sen. Ben Gaeth, R-Defiance,

said he will send Zimmers’ bill to a sub- ‘

committee today. ~

“Zimmers’ bill had been scheduled for
its‘ second hearing in the committee
today. .

_"‘I haven’t had one letter of support
with Zimmers’ bill,_ and I have a pile
from people who have problems with

Hickey’s bill is also expected to b
sent to Gaeth’s Agriculture, Commerct
and Labor Committee. Gaeth said Hick
«ey’s bill does not have the problem:
Ziinmers’ does.

=“There’s no question about constitu-

“.tionality with it,” he said. “It looks like
this may be a vehicle. We need some
kind of legislation in this area.”

iDayton and some other Ohio cities
have ordinances prohibiting vicious
ddgs. Hickey’s bill would mandate
statewide restrictions.

'Recent dog attacks in Dayton and
other parts of the state have acceler-
ated the movement of Hickey’s bill

Pit bull-is in good condition
after Owner shoots it 3 times ,

 

United Press International

COMMACK, N.Y. — A male pit
bullterrier, shot three times in the
stomach by his owner with an
antique .44-caliber revolver after
the dog attacked the man and his
girlfriend, not only survived, but
was reported in good condition
Thursday.

Authorities said the brown pit
bull reportedly was chasing a family
cat late Wednesday and apparently
attacked the couple when they tried
to stop the animal. '

Dennis Madsen, director of the
Babylon Town Animal Shelter, said

that Peter, Schramm, who lives in

~—

the Long Island community of .
Lindenhurst, grabbed the old pistol 7‘
and shot the dog.

Schramm and Jeana Dimochali
were treated at Brunswick Hospital
in Amityville for bites on their arms
and legs and released. The dog was
taken to the Animal Emergency
Service Clinic in nearby Commack,
where a spokeswoman said it. had
suffered three bullet wounds in the
abdomen and right side and was
“doing well” after surgery.

Suffolk County police said they
went to the house in response to a
report of a “wild dog.”

The most dangerous dog in America

Bred originally for fighting,
increasingly popular pit

bulls are killing and maiming i'
their owners—and strangers

I German Shepherds, Doberman Pin-
schers and Rottweilers used to be the
popular choice for owning a tough
guard dog or projecting a mean, macho
image. But today’s “don’t mess with
me” status symbol in the canine world
is something else entirely. America’s
baddest bad dog weighs between 40
and 60 pounds, can chomp through a
chain-link fence and boasts 150 years of
breeding designed to bring out the
worst in its violent nature.

“A dark and bloody history”

The dog is called a pit bull, and on
one day alone last week, representatives
of the breed killed tWo people—a l6-
month-old ”girl in Jones, Okla., and a
67-year-old retired hospital surgeon in
Dayton, Ohio. While the estimated 1
'million pit bulls represent less than 2
percent of the nation’s canine popula-
tion, they were responsible last year for
seven of the 13 dog-bite deaths record-
ed by the Humane Society of the Unit-
ed States. Pit bulls also are blamed for
hundreds of savage maulings each year
that often leave victims—usually young
children or the elderly—~facing lengthy
reconstructive surgery. “These animals
can be canine crocodiles,” says Randall
Lockwood, a Humane Society expert
on the behavior of vicious dogs. “They
have a dark and bloody history.”

Evidence of that heritage abounds. On
April 6, toddler Melissa Larabee died
from a single massive bite to her throat
from a pet pit bull that turned on her
without warning. The same day, Dr.
William Eckman was fatally wounded in
a horrifying incident in which two of the
“animals savaged him for 25 minutes
‘ while nine people tried to pry off the dogs
with poles, rods and brooms. At one
point, Dr. Eckman clambered onto a car
roof but the dogs leaped after him, pull-
ing him to the ground. The relentless
attack was so ferocious that paramedics
and ﬁreﬁghters called to the scene re-
mained in their vehicles, unwilling to
assist those trying to halt the mayhem.

Last November, 4-year-old Billy Gor-
don, Jr., and his 11-year-old cousin,
Wakeya Buford, were attacked by three
pit bulls near their home in DeKalb, Ga.
Fatal injuries inﬂicted on Billy included
a spine severed in two places. Wakeya,
inert with fear, lay on the ground and
was not hurt. The dogs’ owner, Hayward
Turnipseed, 25, was convicted in Febru-

ary of involuntary man-
slaughter and sentenced to
ﬁve years in prison. It is
believed to be the ﬁrst case
in the U.S. in which some-
one was imprisoned after a
death resulting from a dog
attack. The court ruled
that Turnipseed was negli-
gent in not conﬁning his
animals more carefully.
Pit bulls trace their lin-
eage to the coal-mining re-
gion of Staffordshire, En—
gland, where they were
bred as ﬁghting dogs after bull baiting
was outlawed in 1835. They should not
be confused with Bull Terriers, which
have elongated oval heads and have been
bred for good temperament. Spuds Mac-
Kenzie of the Bud Light television com-
mercials, for example, is a Bull Terrier.
Through the decades, pit bulls—
known ofﬁcially as American Pit Bull
Terriers or American Staffordshire Ter-
riers—have been highly prized for their
combat prowess and “gameness” or
willingness to ﬁght until complete ex-
haustion or death. Several traits mark
pit bulls as particularly dangerous. Un-

will charge silently and
without any provocation.
While other dogs usually
bite and back off, the pit-
bull will clamp its viselike
jaws on a victim and con-
tinue biting, shaking and
tearing, like a shark in a
feeding frenzy, until the victim—or the
dog—is subdued or killed. Their fear-
some nature includes a treacherous Je-
kyll-and-Hyde unpredictability: Many
victims have been unsuspecting owners
who had raised them from pups.
Breeding for better temperament

Pit bulls fall into two broad genetic
groupings. Despite the fact that dog
ﬁghting is a felony in 33 states, the
practice ﬂourishes underground, and
many pit bulls continue to be bred for
aggression. Some responsible fanciers
are breeding pit bulls for good tempera-
ment. But it is difﬁcult, even impossi-
ble, to determine a particular animal’s
bloodlines without thoroughly re-
searching its ancestry.

More than 50 communities, alarmed
by recent attacks, have written regula-
tions or passed legislation aimed at
controlling pit bulls—or banning them
outright. But breed-speciﬁc laws are
running into legal problems. “We need
stronger laws against vicious dogs of all
kinds, and the laws need to be en-
forced,” insists Debbie Le Brun of
Shiro, Tex., secretary of the National
American Pit Bull Terrier Association.
“This is a people problem, not a dog
problem. I own nine pit bulls, and
they’ll lick you to death.” I

Ferocious
pit bulls
are status
symbols

Attacks increase
with popularity

By BOB CAMPBELL
' Free Press Staff Writer

Three unrelated attacks by pit bull-
dogs in the Detroit area last week can
be blamed on increasing popularity of
the sometimes-ferocious breed and the
spring weather, dog experts said Sun-
day.

warned that pit bulls, which are bred to
fight to the death and can attack
without warning, are becoming status
symbols, particularly in the city’s poor
neighborhoods. . .

“We investigated 40 dog-fighting
complaints last year, said Gary Tiscor-
nia, assistant director of the Michigan
Humane Society. “A lot of times it’s
kids who want to have the baddest dog
on the block — it’s a ‘my dog can whip
your dog’ thing.”

Men were mauled by pit bulls Satur-
day in Detroit, Friday in Highland Park
and Wednesday in Redford Township.
A Highland Park man was hospitalized
after being bitten more than 20 times.
Victims in the other attacks were treat-

-ed and released.

Tiscornia said pit bulls, which usu-
ally weigh 35 to 40 pounds, are more
dangerous than other dogs because
their jaws can do more damage, they
attack without warning, and they'don t
relent once they have grabbed a Victim.

It isn’t only pit bulls that have been
causing problems. '

On Saturday, a ISO-pound Bouwer
bit a lO-year-old child on the calf at
Eliza Howell Park in the 23000 block of

Schoolcraft,. police said. On. Sunday-
morning, Detroit police officers -—,

who suspected the dog had rabies -—
cornered and killed the animal.

Detroit animal control officers re-
ceived seven dog bite reports Sunday
morning. About 30 dogs suspected of
biting people, including a pit bull, were
incarcerated at the city pound as part

_ of the standard lO-day observation to

make sure the dogs aren’t carrying
rabies, said Darrell Connell, a supervi-

. sor at the city’s animal control office.

The nice weather allows more op-

. portunity for confrontation, he said.

“It’s the weather. I can show you
the figures,” he said. “You’re just
hearing about it because a man got bit
up severely. We get them all the time.”

Connell said his office usually gets
40 to 70 dog-bite complaints a week
when spring arrives.

Despite the high number of attacks,
it’s the pit bull reports that get noticed.
In addition to being genetically stron-
ger. and more aggressive than most
dogs, pit bulls often are encouraged to
have bad tempers, said Dr. Robert
Schirmer, a veterinarian at Michigan
State University. ‘

hr:

Some pit bull owners féedtheir
dogs gunpowder to burn their stomach
lining and make them wilder; others
have tied dogs in trees and hung tires
from their jaws to increase their
strength.

Marilyn Remillard, a technician at

. Allied Veterinarian Emergency Ser-

vice in Dearborn, said more people are

buying pit bulls instead of Dobermans
; and Bouviers for protection.
; “People who live in the city claim
, that they have these dogs for protec-
‘ tlon,” she said. “It’s a status symbol.”

Man mauled 1n pit bull attack

Retiree 8 leg gaslled; 3d incident reported 1n area in a Week

By JIM FlNKELSTElN

Free Press Staff Writer
A pit bull dog attacked a man

' Saturday, the third such attack by that

breed of dog reported in the area in a
week, Detroit police said. 1

James Alford, 69, a retired City of
Detroit sanitation worker, said he was
walking about four blocks from his
east side Detroit home at 4:30 pm.
when two pit bulls jumped or knocked

down the fence at Queen and Wilshire.

“They caught me,” said Alford as he

‘ prepared to take stitches to the right

‘ calf in Samaritan Health Center. “(One
of them) tore a gash in my leg.”

Alford said he had seen the dogs

before. “I usually always walk on the
; other side of the street, and today for
. some reason I just happened to walk

down that side.”
Police said neighbors chased away

Medical Service.

Police said the dogs returned to the
yard, but that the owners were not
home. A city dog pound spokesman
said the dogs would be collected Mon-
day for a 10-day quarantine.

Neighbors said the dogs have been
penned in the backyard of the corner
home for several years.

“I don’t think they’ve ever done
anything like that before,” said John
Payne. “If you come around, they just
bark. They really won’t go after you.
(The owner) has them as security for
the home.”

Another neighbor said the family
has three small children who regularly
play with the dogs. She added the
owner breeds the dogs and has had
several pups.

Bob Wilson, a city animal control
officer, said pit bulls aren’t more un-
predictable than other dogs — just a lot

stronger.

“They’ve got a lot of power,” he
said. Many that are trained to be
vicious, he added, “just go off the wall
— it’s the kind of dogs they are.”

On Wednesday in Redford, Town-
ship, a 55-year-old vacuum repair shop
owner was mauled by two pit bulls,
and a second man who rescued him was
bitten. On Friday, a Highland Park man
was hospitalized after being mauled by
two pit bulls in an alley.

The recent rash of attacks could be
linked to the spring weather, according

. to animal experts.

“I suspect. . . it has to do with warm
weather, people letting those animals
out,” said William Thompson, a Wayne

State University biology professor

who teaches courses on animal behav-
ior.

A rare red squirrel in Arizona could help

The University of Arizona has asked for a

NEW YORK TIMES - March 30, 1987

Audubon Society in Drive to Protect Way

 

By PHILIP SHABECOFF
Special to 'me New York Times

KEARNEY, Neb., March 26 — An»

nouncing their approach with a hoarse,
tremolo cry, the sandhill cranes return
,to the river as evening falls. At first
they descend in small clusters of half a
:dozen or so. But as the twilight deep-
; ens, the stately birds arrive in waves of
20, then 100, then 1,000, until the world
seems to be filled with their wings and

 

their wild calls.

“This is one of the great spectacles of j
the world,” said Maria Strom, whose;
husband, Kenneth, manages the Na-‘
'tional Audubon Society’s wildlife ref-'
iuge on the Platte River here. “Cranes
,are the last remnant of a vanished
America.” *
' The Audubon Society has begun a
campaign to protect the Platte for the
cranes and other wildlife that conser-
vationists and scientists believe are

dangerously threatened by plans to, di- §
- vert ever more of the Platte for munici- §_
' pal water supplies and agricultural ir-

rigation.
Water Rights and Other Obstacles
But the group faces many obstacles,
because issues of water rights in the

West entail extremely complex politi-
‘cal, economic, legal, sociological and

even emotional considerations. The .
group,must deal with the interests of 3
three states, Nebraska, Colorado and ?
‘Wyoming; strong interest groups such 5

'as farmers, as well as the Federal Bu-
reau of Reclamation, whose mission
has historically been the construction
of dams and provision of water rather
than the protection of wildlife. "
“Humans may destroy in a single
lifespan something that has been going
on for 10 million years,” warned Peter
A. A. Berle, president of the National
Audubon Society. He was here for a
conference on protecting the Platte and
its wetlands for the sandhill crane. ,
The Platte basin is not legally pro-
tected as a habitat critical to the sur-
vival of the sandhill cranes because the,
big gray birds with a patch of scarlet
over their eyes are not an endangered
.. species. Although the basin is also used,
I by such endangered and threatened,
species as the whooping crane, the bald:
eagle, the least tern and the piping.

that actions could be taken to mitigate
any threat to the cranes.

énumber of all other cranes of all spe-

Q cies in the world. Concentrations of the
birds reach as high as 20,000 per river
mile.

The Platte has already lost 70 per-
cent of its historic flow to irrigation, hy-
droelectric and municipal water
projects in Nebraska, Colorado and
Wyoming. Additional water projects
now on the drawing board would drain
all the remaining flow if the projects
were all built, according to Audubon of-
ficials. But losing even part of the cur-
rent flow could destroy the habitat for
the cranes, they warned.

Mr. Berle said the most immediate
threat to the Platte and the cranes was
posed by the Two Forks project, a dam
and reservoir planned for the point
where the North and South forks of the
Platte join. The project would be built

‘ by the, Denver Water Board, which pro-

! vides water for the Denver area.

However, William Miller, manager

of the water board, contended that en»

vironmental studies for the Two Forks

project had shown it would have “little .

or no impact on the sandhill crane.”

But Carse Pustmueller, regional
Platte River coordinator for the Audu-
bon Society, said the Two Forks project
and other projects planned in Wyoming
and Nebraska, would deprive the river
not only of its water but also of the flow
of sediment that scours the river bed
and makes it suitable for the wading
birds.

With the society’s new campaign to
save the cranes, “a door is now opening
up,” Dr. Pustmueller said, adding,
“The water community is at least
starting to think that wildlife may be a
beneficial use of water.” ,

The society will seek to protect key

areas of the cranes’ habitat through

as working cooperatively with land-

Duffy found Garp, a white shepherd mix, while

“When I touched him, he woke up and looked at me
with those great big brown eyes, and that’s what real-

Duffy brought home the heartworm-ridden 3-year-:
old and began training him. Certificates on the man-
tel attest that Garp has mastered basic obedience.

“It turns out that he can do a much better job than
dogs that can hear, because he’s not distracted,” said
Duffy. She had the word “deaf” tattooed to the inside
of Garp’s right leg in case he ever gets lost. “He’s al-’

“I’d like to see people look at dogs that are deaf as
not being disabled, but as being special,” Duffy said.
“They’ve just been the best pets you could ever ask
for.” '

HOUSTON POST - March 10, 1987

Handicapped pets with

Physically impaired animals
getting a new leash on life

. By DEBBIE FE'I'I‘ERMAN
Post Reporter

hen Houstonian Col-
leen Duffy went to
the pound eight years

 

ago looking for a pet, she — like ,

most people — envisioned a
cute bouncy playful pup. But
sympathy overwhelmed her
when she saw the beagle-cooker
puppy whose back leg was so
badly broken that the bones
were sticking out.

“She had been a stray, so she
was supposed to go to research
(at one of the area schools),”
Duffy recalled. “I adopted her
for $5, just to euthanize her hu-
manely.”

But then Duffy began to have
second thoughts: “The whole
way to the vet, I remember
thinking, ‘You’ve had a hell of a
life, and it’s just not fair,’ ”
Duffy said. “I just wanted to
give her a better life.”

The vet amputated the pup’s
leg, and a love affair was
spawned. Duffy christened her
Trinity. .

Then one day about a ye
later, a car struck Trinity as
she darted onto busy Bellaire
Boulevard, breaking her back
and leaving her paralyzed from
the waist down. But Duffy was
determined to save her. Trinity
couldn’t scratch behind her
ears or wag her tail — two dog
pleasures she still can’t enjoy —
but she learned to walk again
using a two-wheeled cart that
functions as her hind legs.

Duffy, 35, is one of a small
number of local animal lovers
who has adopted maimed pets.
Often these animals need spe-
cial attention. Some need veter-
inary care for ongoing health
problems; some must be kept
indoors because they can’t pro-
tect themselves. For others, ex-
tra love is enough.

Owners of these handicapped
pets, however, say the compan-
ionship these creatures offer
more than compensates for the
extra time and money they may
require. ,

“These animals need some-
one who will mold their lifestyle
around them,” said Chris Pow-
ell, director of humane services
at the Houston Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals. “We feel if (an animal) is
not in pain, why not go ahead
and find it a home.” .

Handicapped pets also are up
for adoption at the HSPCA.

“What we have to remember
is that just because there is one
small flaw, that’s not a reason
why it has to be euthanized,”
said Patricia Mercer, executive
director of the HSPCA. “There
are always going to be healthy
animals and handicapped ones
that are euthanized. Yet, it’s
certainly not moral to go ahead
and euthanize it just because of

- a physical handicap.”

Duffy, a marketing manager
for Animal Reference Laborato-
ries, a company that evaluates

I

blood and tissue tests for vets,

must take Trinity on her busi-
ness trips.

For the seven years since
Trinity broke her back, she has
required extraordinary care.

Three times a day, Duffy has to
manually relieve Trinity’s blad-

der by squeezing her lower ab-
domen. And two times a day,
she must feed Trinity a special
diet for a pancreatic problem.
The wrong foods would kill her.

Duffy and the veterinarians
continually re-evaluate Trin-
ity’s condition to ensure that
she’s not suffering. Trinity’s
medical bills have run as high
as $500 a year.

“Unless an animal is in obvia

ous agony,” said Dr. Larry
White of the Briarcrest Veteri-

nary Clinic, “most people won’t

euthanize their pets.” '
“Animals with amputated
limbs get around fine if they
don’t have severe pain,” White
explained. “Blind animals do
wonderful if you don’t change
their environment, and deaf-
ness in animals is a common
problem. I don’t find that an
impairment.” In fact, White

has a blind kitten now at his of-

fice that needs a good home.

special needs

White’s philos0phy saved Lo-
han, a brown- and yellow-
striped kitten. Three years ago,
Shaun Stauffer came to White’s
office with a maimed, bloody
kitten who had been caught in
the fan belt of her parents’ car.
White saw no reason to put the
kitty to sleep. Instead, he am-
putated the 6-week-old stray’s
front paw and stitched up a se-
vere neck laceration.

“I remember thinking, ‘What
have I done? He would be

better off dead,’ ” recalled Stauffer, a 20-year-old
model. “But Doc White said he’d be fine.”

Lohan, who was wild, did not trust Stauffer for sev-
eral weeks. But the three-legged cat has become
tame, and he has made a full recovery. Lohan is by
necessity an indoor cat, since he can’t climb trees to
escape danger, but he hops effortlessly around

. Stauffer’s house.

Wigs, a black and brown shepherd-Doberman mix,
doesn’t act handicapped either, despite the fact that
she only has one eye.

Rosalind Dauzat found herself attracted to the 2-
year-old stray while volunteering for the HSPCA m
January. .

“I knew she probably wouldn’t be adopted Since
she’s an adult dog,” said Dauzat, who just completed
her master’s of business administration. “I think a lot

' of people are not aware that handicapped or adult

dogs are not really a problem.”

Wigs has poor depth perception, which sometimes

L causes her to bump into things or hold her head

askew, but she can hear. That’s something Keeley,
Sasha and Garp can’t do.

Staci Skalovsky wanted 6-month-old Keeley all the
more when the HSPCA told her the kitty was deaf.

“I felt like she needed a home, and I could give her

‘ the kind of environment she needed,” said Skalovsky,
. who adopted her in January.

Keeley, a long-haired white kitten with pale blue

5 eyes, has free rein of her owner’s apartment.

“She looks like her personality,” the 23-year-old -
banker said. “She has lots of energy and curiosity.
She’s mischievous, and she gets into everything.”
Keeley already has trained Skalovsky to feed her on
cue. She rubs her paw against Skalovsky, then runs
into the kitchen and meows, repeating the cycle until
she gets her Nine Lives. . .

Lois and James Hofmann believe that their Dalma
tian, Sasha, also has adapted well to her deafness.

Lois Hofmann adopted Sasha from the HSPCA as a
birthday present for her husband, James, an obstetri-
cian, who wanted a Dalmatian with lots of spots.

“My husband said he was willing to take a grown
one,” said the housewife and part—time nurse. “When
I was told (Sasha) was deaf, I said it didn’t matter.
The only problem is no voice communication. But she
looks for signals.”

Five acres of land adjoin the Hofmanns’ Baytown
home, where their six dogs roam with four horses,

 




donkeys, or publishing pictures of Blackie *
look-alikes and not so look-alikes. - r“

Blackie, incidentally, survived un-
scathed the half-hour ordeal of being rid—
den through the town amid firecrackers,
cherry bombs and chanting crowds. Un- '
daunted. British press accounts feared
Blackie could be traumatized by his near
escape from the “sick senores."

In a tavern, The Star negotiated the pur-
chase of Blackie for 225 pounds (about,
$430) with 62-yearjold donkey dealer Felix‘
Cantalejo, immediately declaring itself the
winner in the Battle of the Burro. The “car-
ing” Sun, claimed it had paid Cantalejo 250
pounds, also in a tavern, to “look after
Blackie forever." They had even lined up.
“cute Coco . . .‘a darling lady donkey” for
Blackie, only to learn~that Blackie had been;
neutered and Coco turned out to be a male. ‘

Donkey at center of tabloid War

.By Ana Westley
Special to the Globe

ADRID - Blackie. an 8-year-old
Spanish donkey, is taking Fleet
Street for a ride in what is like-
ly to be remembered as one of
the fiercest circulation Wars among popu-
lar British tabloids. The battle began in the
remote modntain village of Villanueva de la
Vera in western Spain. >

All the British tabloids claim they saved
Blackie (Morenito) from alleged horrors in a
ritual fiesta dating back to medieval days.
Two papers claim they own the donkey,
who is now awaiting expiration of quaran—
tine. Within 30 days Blackie will be
shipped to a donkey sanctuaryJin Devon in

_ England’s west country. .

It all started weeks ago when the small
but vociferous Spanish Association for the
Defense of Animal Rights chose the Villan-
ueva fiesta to highlight its campaign for
legislation to outlaw'traditional festivities
that involve cruelty to animals in the land
of bull fights.

Spokesmen claimed that each year a
donkey is crushed to death by fat men of
the village who pile on it in a drunken orgy
of savagery. Blackie was this year’s pick.
These allegations were hotly denied by
townspeople. the mayor. the donkey dealer
and the Spanish ambassador in England.
No eyewitness of previous horrors could be

found.Nevertheless, unconfirmed reports
from neighboring towns circulated about
donkeys being pushed off balconies or get-
ting their eyes gouged out.

The 2,000 villagers evidently do not kill
donkeys and were incensed by lurid British
accounts of their festival.‘ Mayor Gonzalo
Marcos, 65, said he wasgoing to sue the
animal rights association and British pa-
pers for smearing the town’s reputation.

The tabloid British press corps in Ma-
drid decamped en masse to the village 130
miles west of Madrid for lastTuesday’s fies-
ta. Weeks ahead of time, The Star, The
Sun, The Mail, The Telegraph, The Daily
Express, The Mirror and a few others be-
gan filing gruesome stories on the plight of
Blackie. The Observer and the Sunday
Times published features as well. Children
wrote letters to King Juan Carlos of Spain
to save Blackie. Colleagues sent in from”
England, representatives of British animal
protection societies. and veterinarians
thronged to Vi’llanueva. ' ;

Unsuccessfully disguised as Spanish
peasants, the intrepid men of Fleet Street
began a round-the—clock watch on one an-
other. More adept at buying up exclusives
from pop stars. runaway jewel thiefs and
surrogate mothers than bidding for beasts
of burden, .the reporters were generally
seen to have made fools of themselves in -
their antics to buy the donkey.

Reporters accused each other of sneak- .
ing around olive groves in search of similar

Honda/California. Her devoted owners, Glen and
Nancy Crowl, also keep three leOpards, three
wolves, a raccoon, an otter, a miniature donkey,

four ferrets, a badger, a boa constrictor, two tigers
and two other cougars—Felice’s parents. Even
though Felice is provided with a loving
environment, the Crowls are concerned about this
young cougar because she is a victim of

gradual impairment of vision that can result in
blindness. In Felice’s case, the eye disease has
resulted in blindness.

Of course, wild cat yarnsare exiting to spin,
but a true story about a spunky blind eat, like

. Felice, is compelling because she is a living

illustration of a feline coping with an incurable
eye disease. ' ' ., '

FELICE’S ROOTS

About tvlo—and—a-half years ago, the Crowls
obtained the necessary permits to own Felice and
the rest of their menagerie which has been
operating as School Safari, using the animals for
educational lectures at schools, hospitals and fairs.
The Crowls bought the animals and buildings
from the former School Jungle Safari, where
Nancy had received training in the special
handling of exotic animals.

When Felice was born at the compound she
was taken away from her mother eight hours
after birth—but for an important reason. Glen
explains that since Felice is primarily used for
educational lectures it was mandatory to
desensitize her natural cougar animal behavior,
thus preparing her for a lifestyle that includes
people. - .

Felice’s mother, Tabitha, is an eight-year-old

9

carrier of glaucoma, but this fact was unknown at

the time of breeding. So when Tabitha was bred
with Chavie, now a nine-year-old breeding cougar,
glaucoma was passed onto Felice.

COPING WITH GLAUCOMA

Unfortunately, today, Felice is totally blind.
And you can’t overlook Felice’s left eye which
appears much larger than a normal cougar’s eye,
plus the cloudy corneas are noticeable. Felice has
been diagnosed to have glaucoma and cataracts
which results from an increased ﬂuid pressure—
within the eye—damaging the retina.

Erin Warr, a twenty-threeyeanold volunteer at
School Safari, claims that Felice growls a lot of
the time because she is blind, “but we allow her
to do that,” says Erin, “because she is adapting.”
And while Felice is learning to adjust, she helps
Glen when he speaks to groups of children about
the animals of School Safari; their backgrounds,
personality traits, training and care. Glen, a
thirty—ﬁveyear—old extroverted outdoorsman type,
considers Felice a welcomed role model when
School Safari attends classrooms for the visually
impaired and handicapped children, since Felice is

' a tangible example of coping with an obvious

disability.

Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, The Boy’s Club,
Stanford Children’s Hospital and Camp Harmon
Easter Seal Camp youngsters are just some of‘the
various groups that Felice interacts with and,
according to Glen, this seventy-eight pound cat ‘
CATS MAGAZINE

loves all of the attention. Glen points out that he
sees the results of what he and animals like
Felice are doing by touring places like the
Stanford Children’s Hospital. “These kids are
cooped up in the hospital all of the time,” says
Glen. “Some of them have incurable diseases and
sOme of them are going through therapy.” He
pauses for a moment and enthusiastically adds,
“Think about what it can do! Hopefully, it

’brightens up their day and gives the kids

something to enjoy.” Glen also feels that Felice
can help handicapped children by allowing them
to identify with another one of God’s creatures
that must adapt too. And undoubtedly, Felice
beneﬁts physically and psychologically from all of
the caring as she is one of the star attractions of
School Safari.

However, Glen recalls one particular occasion
when Felice attracted more attention than
anticipated while she was on lecture duty at an
elementary school. The task of explaining to a
bunch of young school children about Felice’s
odd behavior during her estrus cycle is an
experience Glen will never forget! Felice was
making- her distinct female yowling sound and
scooting low to the ground. Glen had to convince
the kids that Felice was not being aggressive, but
was simply in heat.

’ It is important to note that the primary
reason why Felice was not spayed, according to
Glen, is because of the fact that she had just
undergone an eye operation, therefore another
surgery would be stressful to the animal.
Furthermore, Felice has undergone two eye
operations which were not performed to restore
her vision, but to reduce the swelling of her eyes
and relieve her headaches.

TWO CRUSADERS: TWO VETERINARY
OPHTHALMOLOGISTS

The ﬁrst operation was performed by Lewis
H. Campbell, D.V.M., a diplomate of the American
College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists (ACVO).
He performed a procedure to help Felice which is
called the technique of intraocular prosthesis. All
internal structures of the eye are eviscerated
leaving only the outer coat (the sclera and
cornea). A silastic sphere is then introduced into
this cavity and the eye is sutured closed. The
surgery was done because Felice’s right eye had
glaucoma, was enlarged and uncomfortable. The
operation was very successful for a duration,
however, when the surgery was completed Felice
was still quite young. Since then her skull and
eye orbit has grown to the adult size for a cougar
and the eye did not grow along with it.

Presently, Randall H. Scagliotti, D.V.M.;
ACVO, is fussing over Felice’s left eye. Dr.

ONE EXTRAORDINARY CAT

Scagliotti believes glaucoma in the .cougar is
probably very, very rare. He explains that in the
wild—since cougars would be blinded by
glaucoma—and therefore unable to hunt, so they
probably would not survive as opposed to captive
cats. “But if we perpetuate the inherited nature of
this thing,” .says Dr. Scagliotti, “then we will see
a higher incidence in those captive cats.” He
explains that glaucoma is not common in
domestic cats like it is in dogs. However,
glaucoma is found in the domestic feline, but it is
usually a secondary problem, rather than seen as
a primary disease

So Felice is the very ﬁrst glaucoma case Dr.
Scagliotti has ever seen in the mountain lion and
he is fussing over her for two reasons. One, is to
help reduce any pain that she may have, and

7 two, to present a more acceptable cosmetic

appearance for the cat since her left eye is so

enlarged. He ﬁrst saw Felice March 21, 1985
when she was eleven-months—old and her left eye
was probably forty percent larger than the normal
adult cougar eye. He performed a technique of
cyclocryosurgery which is a noninvasive
procedure. Multiple focal areas of ciliary body
structure that produces ﬂuid in the eye are frozen
and thawed, resulting in death to the cells which
produce this ﬂuid build up. This ﬂuid build up
increases the intraocular pressure, so by
decreasing production the pressure falls.
Cyclocryosurgery is done on humans as well as
dogs and cats. And basically, the surgery is safe
since there is no risk of infection because the
tissue is not opened 7 »

The Crowls did notice that Felice’s eye
decreased in size for about six months following
the surgery, but then her eye resumed an
enlarged state to the point where it is now.
Therefore, Dr. Scagliotti is going to try the
cyclosurgery again, hoping that a satisfactory
result can be achieved this time around, and that

it will be much longer lasting. When domestic felines that derive pleasure from
cyclocryosurgery is performed in the dog and extending their claws and raking them across the
domestic cat, it is extremely effective and it rarely nearest surface, thus she has been declawed.
requires further surgery. Since this is a new Felice, like most cats, purrs easily, according to
procedure in the cougar it is difﬁcult to predict the School Safari crew. And it is not difﬁcult to
what kind of results will occur. Dr. Scagliotti imagine a low vibratory purr being expressed by

remains to be seen. h, " ‘I 3?”

HOME AT THE COMPOUND

Is Felice in any pain? The Crowls say no.
Yet, Dr. Scagliotti admits that it is difﬁcult to
determine if Felice feels discomfort, particularly
since glaucoma in the cougar is not that
commonplace. He claims that those types of
patients who have a buphthalmic (enlarged) eye
will either exhibit overt pain, in which case you’ll
ﬁnd them rubbing their eye with their paw on
the grass, or in the case of a household pet,
along the furniture. Dr. Scagliotti says that Felice
probably could be expected to rub her face along
the enclosure of fencing at the compound or with
her paw. Pain also can lead to altered behavior
(aggression or retiring or hiding behavior.)

But if you were to visit Felice at the
compound you would most likely see one
apparently contented feline. It wouldn’t be unusual
to ﬁnd her sitting casually on the ground beside
Glen. And a dedicated volunteer like Warr .will
not hesitate to tell you that “Felice is in heaven
if you let her sit on your lap.”

So the Crowls are doing all they possibly can
for Felice. Their veterinarian bills vary from $500
to $800 per month, and you can bet a large
percentage of payments are for Felice’s well-being.
Nancy Crowl is a thirty-eight-year-old loving
animal owner who works as an industrial
seamstress which helps to support the School
Safari family. Glen is a sheetrocker. An estimated
$250 per week is spent on animal food, vitamins,
and other essentials for the animals. But School
Safari somehow makes ends meet with the lecture
fees and donations from compound tours. Four
trainers, and at least four volunteers help tend
Felice, Tabitha and Chavie, along with all the
other School Safari animals, some with other
handicaps. But whatever the case, all the animals,
exceptional or not, receive lots of personal
attention at home inside the compound.

Outside in the wilderness, today, the mountain
lion is classiﬁed as an endangered species.
Cougars must ﬂee from cattle ranchers who fear
destruction of their livestock, and those humans
who hunt wild cats for sport. Perhaps Felice is
better off than her cat family, the cougars free to
roam the wild.

Felice is a survivor and her spunk and \
adaptability are commendable traits for any cat, .
wild or captive. At home, Felice is similar to

she won’t adapt to you.”

Part of the work of the founda-
tion, said Phillips, is using the tech-

-‘ niques learned from working with

Koko and helping communicate

Q with humans who can’t communi-
. cate verbally.

That, and the Foundation’s

 

language used by the deaf.

Phillips had learned American
Sign Language after seeing the Na-
tional Theatre for the Deaf. She
never realized she would use the
training to talk to a gorilla. But that
training, and her background as a
performer and mother, impressed
Patterson.

But when Phillips came to work
at the Foundation, she had to learn
a new sign language.

“The signs we use with Koko are
based on ASL, but we refer to them
as GSL —- Gorilla Sign Language.
The difference is that Koko’s hands
don’t move the same way ours do.”

And sometimes, said Phillips,
Koko decides how a sign should be,
and there’s no changing her mind.

efforts to stop the rapid decline and

possible extinction of the gorilla =

population, are what Phillips wants
the Foundation to be known for.

What most of the world knows
about Koko, however, is that she
once had a pet kitten named All-
Ball; When All-Ball accidently was
run over, the network news cam-
eras lit up.

“We got a lot of kittens deliv-
ered to our door," said Phillips, who
now gives the Foundation’s post of-

fice box, not the street address.- ‘ .

Koko has another kitten now,
but she still is troubled by the death
of her first pet.

“Before, when you asked her
how a gorilla dies, she would say,
“old, trouble.’ After Ball was killed,
and you brought up the subject of
death, she would turn her back and
never discuss it again.”

Koko and a male gorilla, Mi-
chael, live in adjoining trailers. The
volunteers who work with gorillas
are in the same small room with

them, but they are separated by a,

wire mesh. While people such as

Phillips talk and play and feed Ko-‘-

 

ko and Michael, they take meticu-
lous notes on their conversa-ans.
Signs must be verified by me mac-

;pendent 'observers and must be

used consistently to be considéred

valid. 3
There has been some question

about whether Koko actually can

u—

jtalk or just is copying learned be-
jhavior. Phillips insists she talks to
j her friend Koko, much like a parent
talks to a 5-year-old child.

A recent Foundation newsletter
‘ included examples of those

conversations, such as this one:
March 6, 1986
Koko: “Thirsty”

Phillips: “Me, too. I’m thirsty

Koko: “Good”
Phillips: “1 wish I could sleep."
Koko: “Sleep good. Sleep you.”

Like more and more zoos across
the country, North Carolina’s

noisy baboons cavorting on
an island; a pair of majestic
elephants lumbering across
a meadow to drink from a
watering hole.

The focal point of this

TAMPA — Virginia Bates’ house is crawling with
cats. '

' Close to 100, in fact, and the number increases by
the day.

Kittens romp in one room, adults lounge in a
screened-in porch and the spayed and neutered variety

Bates said she doesn’t go out looking for the animals

continuously drop them off at her house.

“I can’t think of anybody who comes in quite as ‘
often as she does,” said Charlie Price, an employee

there. “She’s a nice lady. She has a big heart.”

Bates pays $24 there to have cats spayed and $19 to
have them neutered, Price said. The cost for dogs de-
pends on their weight, beginning at $37.50 for spaying
and $32.50 for neutering. The cost increases about $1
for every pound over 30.

Bates says she has gone $5,000 in debt the last five
years, due to the expenses of the operations, food and
not having a job.

2:Canada Allows Resumption ‘
Of Seal Hunting From Ships

 

By JOHN F. BURNS
Special to The New York Times

TORONTO, March 24 -— The Cana-é
dian Government has approved a reg
sumption of large-scale commercial
seal hunting from ships off the coun—
try’s east coast, prompting an outcry
from animal welfare groups whose
protests virtually ended seal hunting as
a major industry in the region four
years ago.

Fisheries Minister Thomas Siddon
announced that the new hunt on the ice
floes off Newfoundland would be re-
stricted to older, black—coated harp
seals. These animals exist in profusion
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence —— official
estimates say there are three million of
them — and have been hunted on a
small scale by individually operated
boats throughout the moratorium on

, warned of a possible worldwide back-

 

hunting from larger vessels.
Quota Set at 57,000

Government approval for the hunt
was given in return for assurances that
there will be no return to the killing of
white-coated seal pups, the focus of an
,international campaign for a decade
until 1983. In addition, the hunters will,
be restricted to using rifles. One factor?
‘ in past protests was that the hunters
é clubbed seal pups to death to avoid
. damaging their pelts. 4
| Officials of the Fisheries Depart-l
‘ ment in Ottawa said the quota for the
hunt had been set at 57,000 seals, to be
, taken over the next few weeks. '
In Newfoundland, the Puddisterf

Trading Company of St. John’s an-
nounced that it would send out two
ships in the next week. A rival concern,
the Karlsen Shipping Company of Hali-

fax, Nova Scotia, said one of its vessels,

the Chester, had already put to sea.

Each vessel may take as many as ‘1

10,000 seals.

In Ottawa, Mr. Siddon said that. the,

Government’s approval had been given

after considering the hardships im-g

posed on the owners of the large ves-

sels that traditionally took part in the
",hﬁnt. “The Offshore fleet has a historic
and legal right to participate in the,
i hunt,” he said. Other Government offi-i
I cials said the scale of the renewed
hunting would pose no threat to the sun;
vival of the harp seals as a species. a
Mr. Siddon’s assurance that he had a
Written guarantee from the sealing;
companies that they would not kill seal
pups did little to to placate animal-
rights campaigners, who said that the

announcement had come as a surprise. .,

"Richard Moore, Executive Director'
of )the International Fund for Animal
Welfare, described the Governmentl

decision as “irresponsible” and 5
lash against the purchase of Canadian
fish. , ‘

One veteran protester, Daniel Mo-
rast of Falmouth, Mass, was reported
to have set out for the hunting area, and
others were planning to head for the
area on boats. Canadian law prohibits;
anybody without a license from ap-S
proaching within a kilometer, about'
five-eighths of a mile, of a seal or a
hunting area, and officials said that the
rule would be enforced.

Mr. Siddon said that two officers
from his ministry would be aboard
each hunting vessel to insure compli-
ance with regulations.

Opposition to the hunt was also
voiced by the smaller operators, who‘
said that the market for their productsﬂ;
including seal meat and black~skinned:.‘
pelts, would be endangered if there was;
a renewed international campaign"
against the hunting. The previous cam-:
paign succeeded in getting the Euro»
pean Community to ban the import of
seal—pup skins in 1983, and the United
States has had a similar ban since 1976.

« “It was the closure of the European
market that effectively ended the seal
hunt as a major economic activity.
From a $12 million industry in 1982,;
seal hunting in the Gulf of St. Lawrence‘
shrank to virtually nothing last year.
At the peak of the hunt, 185,000 seals.

Were killed annually.
‘L a Killings Aroused Indignation

» The three vessels heading for the
new hunt were expected to concentrate
on an area known as the Front, where
large numbers of female harp seals
congregate each spring to give birth to
pups known as whitecoats. It was film
and photographs of men bludgeoning
the pups to death that aroused indigna-
tion around the world and attracted
well-known figures to the anti-sealing
cause, including Brigitte Bardot. ;
."Officials of the Fisheries Depart-5,
ment said regulations for the hunt:
would permit the killing of mature,
males and females, but not nursing'
mothers. They said the Government. in- i
spectors on the ships would insure that j
the hunters did not pursue seal pups‘
that have shed their white coats, a pro— ii
cess that occurs at about three or four
weeks. ,’
aThe officials also denied that politics "
had played any role in the decision to
renew the hunt. Prime Minister Brian ?
Mulroney’s Government, only the third
to be formed by the Progressive Con- .,
servative Party in the last half-cen-i
tury, has slumped badly in the polls, :
particularly in Newfoundland and the
other Maritime Provinces, which were 3
strong backers of the party in the 1984
eiection. ,_ _,

:The Government has been at odds re-
cently with the Newfoundland Pre-
mier, Brian Peckford, over a decision
to extend the ocean area off Newfound-
land in which French fishing vessels
are allowed to operate. The decision,
part of an accord under which the
French Government agreed to submit
a dispute over territorial waters to in-
ternational arbitration, aroused fury in
Newfoundland’s recession-hit fiShing
industry.

~. John Crosbie, a Newfoundlander who
hdlds the Transport portfolio in Mr.
M-ulroney’s Cabinet, had threatened to
ﬁasign over the fishing dispute. When
the decision to renew the sealing cam-
paign was announced, he said oppo-
nents of sealing, “if they are reason-
able and fair,” would accept that the
hunt would do nothing to endanger the
species while increasing revenues in an
economically deprived area of the
country.

Mr. Crosbie noted that a Government
commission that investigated the seal
hunt a few years ago had described the
killing of the seals as “humanely con-
ducted and economically significant”,

you see them rocking back and

' Karen said she couldn’t dis-
cuss how the group found
SEMA, because that would be
revealing something that would
endanger someone else. She
also declined to say anything
about where the four young

, chimps are living now or where

5 they will go when they grow up,

for fear of revealing something
that would lead to their discov-
ery by the police. But she was
eager to show snapshots of two
of the chimps nuzzling blissfully
in the arms of their new foster

mother —— a woman with a

white mask and a red wig.

True Friends took only four
of the young chimps in SEMA’s
lab, Karen said, because they
could only be sure of placing
that many adult chimpanzees.
“It’s going to be difficult
enough to do that, but we be-
lieve we can.”

In Karen’s view, the animal—
rights movement is a logical ex—
tension of earlier liberation ef-
forts. “I don’t think it’s a freak
offshoot. It’s part and parcel of
the whole human-rights move-
ment.” The True Friends, she
said, feels a close kinship with
the abolition movement of the

Karen said she knew True
Friends wasn’t going to end the
use of all animals in laboratm
in the near future. But aiding
the use of chimpanzees, she
said, is an achievable goal. She
paused and studied the snap-
shot of the two small chimps

tionable. But how could a mn‘se
who m 5131‘ and dying people

every day completely oppose
medical research? Karen replied
that she would be the first to
admit that some research done
on animals is helpful to human
beings. “But I also think they’re
not looking for enough other
ways,” she said. “I know we
can’t replace the use of animals
today. But we have some awful~
ly bright pe0p1e. If they had to
ﬁnd other ways, they could.”.
Even if you can’t replace ani-
mals, Karen said, “you can’t ig-
nore the ethical question. Just
. because it’s useful and helpful
doesn’t mean it’s OK to- do.”
But what if alternatives
don’t exist? What if there is no
alternative to using chimps to
ﬁnd a vaccine for AIDS. “AIDS
patients mine into my inten-
sive-care unit,” Karen replied
quietly. “I’ve seen how they
_ suffer, and I’ve been with some
of them when they died.” After
a pause, she continued: “But
even if it does help us, I don’t
think we have a moral right to
use ’chimmnzees. They have

down to that.” Even though her
nursing work exposed her to
hepatitis, Karen said that she
hadn’t taken the hepatitis B
vaccine because it had been
tested on chimpanzees. She
didn’t feel it was right.

And, she added, some basic
things have been forgotten in
“the hysteria about AIDS.
We’ve been whipped into a
frenzy of fear as if this is the
bubonic plague, when it’s actu-
ally a preventable disease. Why
aren’t we spending money on a
massive prevention program. ”
In general, she said, modern
medicine pays far too little at-
tention to prevention. For ex-
ample, she said, instead of using
animals for research on artifi-
cial hearts and transplants,
money involved should be used
for a major campaign to educate
people about ways to prevent
heart disease.

It was no accident that True
Friends took chimpanzees
scheduled to be used for AIDS
research, she said. They want-
ed to bring the ethical issue to
the forefront. When it comes to
using chimpanzees for research,
she said, “someone had to stand
up and say it’s wrong. It’s just
wrong. Wrong to use intelli-
gent, sensitive creatures like

 

this, wrong to imprison. them, i

wrong to drive them ma .'”

he True Friends, Karen
said, spent hours talking
about the ethical issues
and about breaking the law and
the risk of going to jail. But it
soon became evident that the
key Question wasn’t whether
they could get the chimps out,
but what they would do with
the chimps after the raid. Tak-
ing on chimpanzees, the True
Friends realized, would be a de-
manding and expensive respon-
sibility. At the outset, the group
agreed that there would be no
raid unless they were sure they
could provide good care for the
animals. It took months, Karen
said, to work out in detail how
they will care for the four baby
chimps that will live 50 years
and grow up to be big, powerful
animals. “It’s not like you dash
in and dash out,” she said.
Once these practical prob-
lems were settled, Karen said,
there was little question that
they would go ahead with the
raid. “Once you feel strongly
enough about this to break into
a lab, you stop thinking about
the dangers involved. You feel

whatever you experience in jail

could never be as bad as what

rights movements ofthe 19605,
others, Karen said, have never
been active in anything at all.

The idea of making a raid
developed gradually. As Karen
heard reports from the Animal
Liberation Front, the oHer un—
derground group, and saw how
their raids exposed abuses in
laboratories, she began to think
she would like to get in touch
with the group and do the same
kind of thing. By then she was
already working on the labora-
tory-animal issue by going to
meetings and setting up a lit-
eratm'e table on sidewalks and
distributing leaﬂets to passers—
by. Through this work, she met
like—Med people, who even-
tuallybecametheTrue Friends
Upon reflection, the members
(K the group decikd that it
wouldn’t be wise to contact the
Animal Liberation Front, since
, members of that group wereal-
; ready being sought by police in
: connection with laboratory
, break-ins. Perhaps they didn’t
j need help from the Animal Lib—
; eration Front anyway. “Why
not do it ourselves.” Karen re-
membered thinking. “If they
‘ can do it, why won’t we?”

Besides, she continued, her
group felt uneasy with the “ag-
gressive image” the public as»
sociates with the Animal liber~
ation Front. The True Friends
saw their own intentions as
peaceful and friendly. “We
wanted to get across that ani-
mals need people to be their
friends,” Karen said. “Animals
are vulnerable. They can be
hurt, and they are hurting
moi!

 

ow, I asked, would a
nurse come to join a
group formed to raid a
laboratory doing medical re-
search? There had been many

inﬂuences, Karen said, describ»

ing her childhood pets, her fam-
ily, her participation in the
antiwar movement, and her

work. And as she talked, I
sensed that the compassion and
empathy that had drawn her to
' nursing also pushed her toward
the animal-rights underground.

Karen became aware of the
plight of laboratory animals
when she started going to a
nearby medical library to do
background reading about the
medical conditions of some of

 

her patients. What she read in
the medical journals made her
uneasy. "‘At ﬁrst, I thought all
this was just kind of sad, but
after a certain amount of read-
ing, it dawned on me that this
was excessive,” she said, recall-
ing an experiment that scalded
guinea pigs in boiling water.
One of the psychology journals,
which she read because of an
interest in psychiatric nursing,
reported on an experiment
about “learned helplessness” in
which dogs were repeatedly
given electric shocks until they
stopped trying to escape and
collapsed, urinating and whim-
pering in fear.

“After a while I stopped .

reading to find out about a par-
ticular disease,” Karen said. “I
was reading because I wanted
to find out about what they
were doing to animals.” A
Her activism, she said, was

shaped both by her family’s ,

sensitivity to injustice and by
the political ferment of the
Vietnam War era. “My parents

3 were very disturbed by the way
' black pe0ple were treated in

this society. And they were
very sensitive to animals. My
father was horrified by the
thought of hunting.” But her
parents aren’t activists by any
means. “Just good people —
good, honest, decent people
with good values.”

Like many college students
of . her generation, Karen, he»
came involved in the antiwar
movement in the late 19603.
She marched in demonstrations
and picketed draft offices, ex-
periences that showed her that
“if you are disturbed by some»
thing you see in society, you do
something about it.” Remem—
bering, she paused and reﬂect-
ed a moment; “I think growing
up in the ’60s gave me a sense
that I could affect society."

Later, Karen turned her en-
ergy to issues affecting the
poor in her community. She
helped raise money for the

Meals on Wheels program for v

the elderly, which, she felt, had
been crippled by President Rea»-
gan’s budget- cuts. Some people
might say that it’s better to

 

 

‘ worry about the elderly than

about chimpanzees, I ventured.
For a while, Karen said, she

, tried to work in both areas. But

she eventually recognized that
she just didn’t have enough
time for bothfandshe decided
to devote her energies to ani- -
mal rights. “You have to work
where your heart is,” she said.

“Y on are most effective work-
ing where your feelings are
' strongest and deepest.” Why

did the plight. of animals affect
her so much? Karen thought for
a moment. It was animals’ vul-
nerability, she said. “I have a
very strong feeling of how de-
pendent they are on om“ good
will. If I don’t help them, who
else will?”

She began telling the story
of the rabbit, which was res-
cued from a commercial labora- ,
tory that tests safety in every-
day products such as oven
cleaners and shampoos. It all
began when a new technician in
the hospital lab approadied Ka-
ren, asking if she could take
care of the rabbit until the tech-
nician found it a home. When
she found Karen was sympag

’ as an animal-(me technician be-

cause she thought it would be
fun to work with animals, and

‘ she had been hired by one of

these labs right after school.
Unable to stand it, she quit a
short time later, taking two
rabbits and two rats with her.
In their long talks, the tech-
nician described Draize tests, in
which rabbits are placed in
stocks, so they can’t move

'when irritating chemicals are

placed in their eyes. For skin ir-
ritancy tests, technicians would

apply harsh chemicals directly
to the rabbits’ shaved skin,
;; which would then be swathed in

plastic wrap and bandaged.
“When they removed the ban-
dage in a few days,” Karen said,
“the rabbits would have horri-

‘ ble, bleeding wounds.”

Karen was deeply disturbed
by what she heard. “I started
realizing that there is a whole
world beneath the surface of
our existence that is based on a
tremendous amount of suffer-
ing. Beneath everything — the
technology I was using at work,

ed on chimpanzees to ensure
safety and effectiveness.
Landon, the president of
SEMA, calls his company’s lab
“a superb facility. There is no
indication that we have any
problems in the treatment of
animals. You have to realize
that it’s an animal-research lab-
oratory.” Asked about the
cages shown in Breaking Bar-
riers, Landon says, “The only
, response I have is that there
are guidelines for cage size put
out by USDA, and the intent of

this organization has always
been to meet those guidelines.”

After the break-in, NIH began =

an investigation of conditions at
SEMA. That investigation is
ongoing.

Landon refutes Karen’s as—
sertion that the chimps shown
on the tape were deranged or
psychotic. “That’s judgmental
on anybody’s part,” he says. “A
smilefromahumanbeingisa
threat in monkey language. If
you smile, they will respond by
jumping up and down. It’s hard
to say what one calls a de-
ranged animal.”

Specialists in chimpanzee ;
behavior take strong exception. ‘

After viewing the Breaking
Barriers tape, Jane Goodall is-
sued a statement that “the
older chimpanzees demonstrate
neurotic and stereotypic behav-
ior, rocking, nodding, and mum—
bling. My impression, viewing
the film, was that they had be-
come insane as a result of con-
ditions worse by far than those
afforded to the most evil of the
Nazi war criminals.”

Geza Teleki, a leading au-
thority on chimpanzee conser~
vation, adds that research con-

ditions generally are grim, even i
in the laboratories that comply |

with the Animal Welfare Act
and the NIH regulations. And,

 

gstandofscientistsandtostart

doing something.”
? AIDS research, he says, is
of particular concern because

researchers say they must iso—
late the chimpanzees to get sat-
isfactory test results. This iso-
lation, Teleki says, goes against

3 the very nature of this social
species.

Roger Fouts, who has been
working for many years with
Washoe, a chimpanzee famous
for her use of American Sign
Language, argues forcefully
that chimpanzees must be
housed in social groups. “To
me,” Fouts says, “it’s uncon-

scionable to lock them in these
cages. I have to hope these peo—

ple are acting out of igno-
rance.” But, he asks, after all
the research on chimpanzee be-
havior, how ignorant can people
be? A chimpanzee, Fonts notes,
is more closely related to hu-
mans than it is to a gorilla. “We
know they have a complex cul-
ture. We know they are capable
of acquiring human language.
They think, they feel, they suf-
fer, they have the same needs
we do.”

fter leaving SEMA, Ka-
ren drove for some
time, and soon we were
passing through rolling country-

 

side. The conversation drifted

: from the shortcomings of high- ,

technology medicine to whether
it was ethical for vegetarians to

deprive their cats of meat, since '

arts, unlike dogs, are by nature
thoroughly carnivorous. Then,
at one point, Karen reached be—
hind her seat and handed me a
black scarf, which she asked me
to tie over my eyes. “I don’t
mean to seem parano' ,” she

said apologetically, “but this

next stretch is quite distinc-
tive.”

“It looks like an ordinary ofﬁce building,
doesn’t it?” Karen said. “But there’s a horrible,
hidden world in there." She described what
sounded like an animal warehouse —— _a maze of
roomslinedfromﬂoortoceilingwithstacksof
cramped cages. “I just don’t think people know
this exists . . . this whole underground world of
suffering, loneliness, and fear.” -

The isolation chambers housing young chim-
panzees had made a particularly strong impres-
sion on her during surreptitious visits before the
raid. “WhenIﬁrstwalkedin,itwaslikeseeing
rows (d children locked in rows of refrigerators.
That’s what the isolation door reminds me of. It
slams shut like a refrigerator. And inside each
one are these little ones who are desperate for
contact —— to be touched, to have someone talk
to them.”

TheolderChimpsthathadbeeninisolation
for some time were another story. “They were
just rocking back and forth," Karen said. “It re-
minded me of the psychotic'patients I saw when I
worked at a mental hospital, a big state institu-
_ tion with the turd-core schizophrenic cases that

had been there for years. A

“You can’t say to me, ‘How do we know
they’re suffering or they’re crazy?’ It’s the same
behavior I saw in human patients. I just hope
they’re so far gone they don’t know where they
are anymore.” ~

In a videotape made before the raid, the True
Friends documented much of what Karen de-
scﬁbedAfterpartsofthistapewerebroadc-ast
by television stations in the Washington area,
SEMA’s president, John Landon, acknowiedged
that the scenes shown were from the company’s
Rockville laboratory.

To increase public awareness about laborato-
ry conditions, the animal-rights movement also
distributed an edited version of the tape, entitled
Breaking Barriers. It amounts to a guided tour
of what Karen calls “the hidden worid.”

As the tape begins, a woman, her face cov—
ered by a white mask, opens a door and slides
quietly down a long, stark corridor. Halfway
down, she turns and beckons, inviting you to fol-
low. She approaches a door on the left, and the
camera follows her into a room that amounts to
.an aisle between two walls of metal cubes
"‘tacked three high, like a child’s building blocks.

Each of these cubes is a'barred cage, hardly
larger than a microwave oven, where monkeys
are pacing back and forth or round and round in
frenetic, repetitive motions. Round and round,
back and forth at a dizzying pace.

In another room, tiny newborn rhesus mon-
keys -— which, according to the narrative, have
been separated from their mothers — huddle to-
gether on the wire floor of their cage. One tries
to suckle on the edge of his companion’s ear. As
the masked woman extends her gloved ﬁngers
through the bars, the monkeys grab on and begin
to suck greedily. _

Finally,themaskedwomanentersaroom

with a row of steel and glass
chambers, each of which is
about as large as a shower stall.

. To give a better idea of its size,
' she climbs inside one. Except

for the bars, she looks as if she
might be trying to make a call
from a telephone booth. -
These, the viewer is told,
are the isolation chambers
where chimpanzees infected
with hepatitis or AIDS live —-
often for long periods of time
— separated from the outside
world by a large glass and stain-
less—steel door that resembles
those on supermarket dairy

and the bars. The chimp, an
older male known to the lab as
number 1164 and infected with
hepatitis, sits crouched in the

f’? lower corner, where he rocks

incessantly and mumbles to

7 ntil recently, such quar-
ters were all that the

National Institutes of

f Health required of research in-
stitutions receiving federal
funding. Under an amendment,
passed in late 1984, to the fed-
‘ eral Animal Welfare Act, how-
» ever, laboratories must now
3 ' provide housing that “promotes

the psychological well being” of

primates. Whether this will sig-
niﬁcantly improve conditions,
however, remains to be seen.

As the US Department of Agri- ’
culture, which oversees the .
Animal Welfare Act, begins to 2
fashion guidelines to implement '

it, another battle appears to be
brewing between the biomedi-
cal establishment and animal-
protection groups over what is
necessary to fulﬁll the mandate.

 

 

 

 

' Researchers argue that they

cannot provide what primate
advocates say is necessary, be-
cause it is simply too expensive.

Some scientists involved in
AIDS research, such as Phyllis
Kanki of the Harvard School of
Public Health, don’t see a need

i for major changes. Chimpan-

zees involved in research have
pretty big quarters now, she

the isolation units she has seen
used for AIDS are fairly large.

Chimpanzees are vital in de-
veloping a vaccine to prevent
AIDS, Kanki explains, although

' she acknowledges that they are

an “imperfect model.” They
don’t get the disease, but they
are useful because researchers
can determine whether a vac-
cine actually prevents the chim—
panzees from becoming infect-
ed with the virus.

Last month, medical

§ sources reported that a team of

French and Zairian researchers
has been testing a potential
AIDS vaccine in human volun-
teers in Africa. The-news
prompted one American re-
searcher, Dr. Robert C. Gallo,
head of the laboratory of tu-
mor-cell biology at the National
Cancer Institute, to suggest

‘ that there is no reason to hold

off on human trials for a vaccine
here. While human trials to test

 

the safety of potential vaccines
5' are not likely to start immedi-
ately -— or even this year — in
this country, Gallo noted that
the work in Africa is adding mo-
mentum to efforts to minimize
preliminary AIDS vaccine test-
ing in chimpanzees.

However, while expanded
and more immediate human
vaccine testing may take some

, pressure off chimpanzees, sci-

' entists would still probably need
to use some chimps in

challenge experiments, in which
vaccinated animals would be
given live virus to see if the
vaccine is truly protective.
These experiments would be
unethical to perform in humans.

Nevertheless, she said, she op-

We set off in Karen’s car.
“Just to be on the safe side,”

she suggested, we shouldn’ t'

discuss anything specific in the
car. But before we went to a
place where it would be safe to
talk, she said cryptisally, she
wanted to show me something.

‘ To make conversation, I

“asked if she had pets. “I have

animals who live with me, but I
don’t consider them my pets,”
she replied gently. “I consider
them refugees.” One of her ani-
mal roommates, she said, was a
wily, feral cat she had saved

‘ from a dangerous and probably

short life in the alley behind the
hospital. He still didn’ t like peo—
ple very much, but he seemed
to express his gratitude, she
said, by staying around.

In contrast to older, larger,

ganizations, which seek to re-
form the way animals are treat-
ed, the young and growing ani-

‘ trial-rights movement -—- which

includes above-ground organiza-
tions such as People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals
as well as underground groups
such as True Friends and the
Animal Liberation Front -— ad-
vosates a revolution in the rela-
tionship between humans and
animals. The movement’s mem-
bers reject the idea that hu-
mans are entitled to have do-
minion over animals, Karen ex-
plained. And if you accept this
view, she said, then it follows

 

 

that we have no more right to
raise and sell animals for pets
than to exploit them for meat,
fur coats, or medical research.

Karen’s coat, suit, and
shoes all appeared to be made
of synthetic materials. In the
car, I began to feel a bit self-
conscious about my leather
purse and shoes. People do not
have the right to use animals
for their own purposes, Karen
said, even if that purpose is
something relatively benign,
like companionship. “I feel so
strongly that animals are not
ours,” she said firmly. “They
are not our things. They don’t
belong to us. And we don’t have
a right to hurt them for any
reason.”

Her ideas were radical, but
there was nothing strident or
extreme in her manner. She
was salm, soft-spoken, a bit di-
dactic, but not harsh or dogma-
tic.

break the law for a chimpanzee ?

 

BY DIANNE DUMANOSKI

THE RAIDING PARTY CAME AND WENT
like ghosts. There were no signs of forced
entry, no damage, no messages, and no slo-
left on walls, according to ofﬁcials at
EMA Inc.’s research laboratory, in Rock-
ville, Maryland. The only indication that
someone had entered the supposedly well-
guarded lab on that weekend this past Decem-
ber was the disappearance of a couple of
(ages and four young chimpanzees. F our ex-
tremely valuable chimpanzees, which had
been scheduled to be used for research on
contagious diseases such as AIDS and hepati-
tis _

In short order, an undergrmmd animal-
rights group calling itself True Friends con-
tacted the media and claimed credit for the
raid, asserting in a statement that “we must
break the species barrier.” For the growing
animal-rights movement, the break~in was
historic. Over the past five years, raids on lab-
oratories staged by the Animal Liberation
Front, an underground group, have freed
many kinds of animals, including primates, but
theTrueFriends’raidwastheﬁrstsucoessful
“liberation” of chimpanzees.

Coming at a time when AIDS researchers
are demanding greater numbers of chimpan-
zees, the break-in also served to highlight a
growing controversy about chimpanzees in
research. Researchers maintain that chimps
are invaluable in AIDS research because they
are the only species that becomes infected

The Tampa Tribune — 5-3

Records contradict
zoo ’s denials of gift

The historic Hillsboro Hotel building was donated to
the Lowry Park Zoo Association Nov. 24, 1986,

according to records.

By MICHAEL D. DUNN
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA —— The historic Hills-
boro Hotel building was donated to
the Lowry Park Zoo Association and
the Future Farmers of America
Foundation Nov. 24, 1986, according
to records in the Hillsborough Coun-
ty Clerk of Court’s Office.

Zoo officials have denied on sev-
eral occasions the donation took
place and have declined to say why.
But zoo spokeswoman Holly Duncan
told the Tribune Thursday: “We will
make a formal announcement in
April. ”

Duncan would not say how the
building will be used.

“That will also be part of the an-
nouncement. ”

Records show the building actu-
ally was sold to the two groups for
$10. It was appraised at $1.4 million
in 1986 by the county Property Ap-
praiser’s Office.

The Tribune erred in reporting

the previous owners of the former _

.I- --.... ... ,n. ‘f . . ‘... _..-

400-room hotel, which was convert-
ed into an office building in 1974.

County records show the building .

was owned jointly by Lykes Bros.
Inc. of Tampa and Peoples Gas Sys-
tem Inc.

According to warranty deeds
filed in the Clerk of Court’s Office, .

both companies signed over the
building and the land on which it
sits, awarding 70 percent interest to
the zoo association and 30 percent

interest to the Future Farmers of

America Foundation-Leadership
Training Center.

The FFA Foundation is based in
Tallahassee. The foundation plans
to build a leadership training center
near Haines City, according to an
FFA employee.

Officials with Lykes Bros. and
the FFA did not return the Tri-
bune’s telephone calls. A spokes-
woman with Peoples Gas System
said she could not comment until
the zoo association’s official an-
nouncement in April.

Historic hotel Wen

to Lowry Park Zoo

By MICHAEL D. DUNN
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA 4—- Lykes Bros. Inc. of
Tampa has donated a major interest
in the historic Hillsboro Hotel to the
Lowry Park Zoo Association, the
Tribune learned Wednesday.

According to a knowledgable
source who spoke on condition of
anonymity, “A verbal agreement
was made within the last few
months” between zoo association of-
ficials and members of the Lykes
family, co—owners of the 76-year~old
former hotel in downtown Tampa."

"It’s a charitable donation by
the Lykes family,” the source said.
“They gave the zoo a 70 percent in-
terest. I don’t know where the rest
will go. I don’t know whether it’s
because Lykes only owns 70 percent
or what.”

Tribune files indicate the Hills-
boro Hotel Office Building is owned
by Hillsboro Buildings Inc., which is
co-owned by Lykes Bros. and the
law firm of MacFarlane, Ferguson,

County Clerk of Court’s Office
closed before the co-ownership
could be verified.

Officials from Lykes Bros. and
the MacFarlane law firm could not
be reached to confirm the donation.
But another source, who also asked
not to be identified, said, “That hap-
pened a couple of months ago.”

Sally Lowry Baldwin, chairwom-

an of the zoo association, which op--

erates Lowry Park 200 on North

.Boulevard and Sligh Avenue in

Tampa, denied Wednesday that the
building had been donated to the as-
sociation.

Zoo officials also denied the do-
nation had been made when asked
by a Tribune reporter on Feb. 16.

A 200 spokeswoman would not
say what the building would be used
for if it were donated.

Marcia S. Austin, of Hill and
Knowlton public relations firm,
said, “I can’t say anything” when
asked if the building had been do-
hated.

Hill and Knowlton is the 200 as-
sociation’s public relations firm. '

The 400-room former hotel at
512 Florida Ave. was built in 1911
and expanded in 1924, but closed in
1969. The Lykes family, through its
company Tampa Hotels Inc., origi-
nally purchased the hotel in 1948
for $1,055,000, sold it to the Gills
Hotel Co. in 1960 for $2.5 million,
then repurchased it through a tax
auction in 1964 for $647,912. The
hotel was remodeled into an office
building in 1974.

the building caused by age. The
first floor, however, still contains

businesses have been given eviction .

TAMPA‘TRIBUNE - 3/23/87

_. Punish the Owner,
, Not the Animals

As a resident of Hillsborough County,
.I was appalled at the lack of concern
shown during this last election in regard
to pound seizure. With only 75,000 voting,
it just goes to show where people place
their priorities.

I’ve noticed people around here are

greatly influenced by money, politics,
public acknowledgement, restoration of
old buildings and preserving the arts.
They all have their place in life but
where is the compassion for living, feel-
ing things, like God’s creatures, the ani-
mals?

Another thing that amazes me is how
a panel of seven can all agree on one
issue. Is peer pressure and political am-
bition that great? I am glad there was
one political person willing to stand up
for what he felt was right, Judge Vernon
Evans. When God gave dominion over all

living creatures, I am sure he didn’t.
mean to exploit the animals by submit-5

ting them to such horrendous deaths.

I am sure the animal groups are not
against research, they are against the
chop shops, being supported by the cheap
use of pound animals at our medical uni-
versities. .

I don’t think the Tribune helped in its
endorsement of this policy, stating that it
seemed wasteful, not only in tax money,
but in animal life to force USF to use
animals from breeders. Don’t talk about
wasting tax dollars. This is the most
wasteful nation in the world. Look at the
money wasted on that little fish (snail
darter) in Tennessee.

As for the veterinary profession en-
dorsing pound seizure, I say that if its
fees weren’t so astronomical more peo-
ple could have their pets spayed and neu-
tered, thus eliminating the pet population
explosion.

Why don’t people work for low-cost
spay and neuter clinics, tougher leash
laws, and fining the owners, not punish-
ing the animal? People should put things
in their proper prospective.

and 125 million other assorted
creatures. Yet despite the antiq-
uity and ubiquity of the human-
animal bond, neither Freud nor
anyone else has shed much sci-
entiﬁc light on the phenome-
non. “Animals are so taken for
granted,” says Alan Beck, di-
rector of the University of
Pennsylvania’s Center for the
Interaction of Animals and So-
ciety. “We have the gut feeling

neurological disorder, a dog was schooled
to pick up signals of an impending seizure
and alert the girl and her parents. “The
dog knows before the girl does that she is

going to have one,” says Leo
Bustad, president of the Delta

i that funds pet studies.

Hospitals are ﬁnding that
animals ease patient isolation
as well as anxiety and distress.
Three of the most popular vis-
itors to elderly patients at
Beth Abraham Hospital in
New York City come from the
A.S.P.C.A.: Jake, a bull mastiﬁ‘;
Boris, a SO-lb. Samoyed; and
Regina, a tortoiseshell cat. At
Children’s Hospital in Denver,
staff members and volunteers
bring in their dogs, cleanly
clad in smocks or T shirts,
and make rounds of wards.

are welcoming pets too. The

Washington boasts a menager-
ie of furry and feathery live-
ins. Some have aided in physi-

they‘re good and what can be
done with that. we don’t know.”

Now things are beginning to change.
A variety of health professionals have
started to assess rigorously pets‘ impact on
physical and mental health. Meanwhile,
the beneﬁciaries of programs in prisons,
hospitals and nursing homes do not much
care about cool science but are warmly
grateful for what amounts to animal ther-
apy. A groundbreaking study came in
1980, when researchers from the Univer-
sities of Maryland and Pennsylvania re
ported on the survival rate of 92 patients
with serious heart trouble. Of the 39 with-
out pets, eleven were dead within a year.
The remaining 53 had animals ranging
from an iguana and Bantams to the typi-
cal cats, dogs and ﬁsh; just three of those
patients died. The results were not due to
increased exercise, like walking a dog.
Even owning ﬁsh proved a boon. Later re-
search provided a partial explanation: an
animal’s presence helps lower blood pres-
sure and reduce stress.

More recent studies suggest other
pluses. In a 1984 Philadelphia study of pa-
tients about to undergo dental surgery,
some were hypnotized, others were told to
look at an aquarium full of ﬁsh, and the
rest sat quietly for 20 minutes. The ﬁrst
two groups experienced the least discom-
fort. Surprisingly, watching ﬁsh was as ef—
fective as being hypnotized. Why animals
are so soothing is still a mystery. Psychia-
trist Aaron Katcher of the University of
Pennsylvania speculates that stroking an-
imals and talking to them stimulates the
brain’s production of its own pleasure
chemicals, the endorphins.

 

Psychological beneﬁts have also been
documented. Troubled teenagers, for ex-
ample, are more likely to open up when a
therapist brings a dog along. Carol Antoi-
nette Peacock, a psychologist in Water-
town, Mass, starts treatment of new ado-

in life, to help David deliver the
mail.

“David’s training someone, and
perhaps Fred will go with them.
5 This is her purpose,” she reiterated.

, Liggett, like Bohannon, obvious-
ly is fond of her dog. Each day, she
“dresses” her in a different colored
neckerchief. “Fred has a whole
wardrobe. She’s always dressed ——
she’s a neat dog,” Liggett said.

Liggett is not the first owner
Fred has had since coming to Tam-
pa. She was brought here by Mark
Mullen when he moved back home
from a break at Andover Prep
School in Massachusetts.

Named “Mighty Manfred the
Wonder Dog” after a television
character, she was a wonder mostly
because of her Labrador/Irish set-
ter heritage.‘

It gave her coat a black sheen
with a deep red cast. Now, that coat
is sprinkled with gray, and her muz-
‘zle has turned almost white.

When she first arrived at the
. Mullen home, there were five chil-
dren there, and life was doggone
. good for a puppy named Fred.

After the offspring of Ann and
"John Mullen began growing up and
.moving away from Tampa, Fred
started spending more time at the
., house next door.

Eventually, her visits extended
into a live-in situation. The Mullens
moved to a condominium that
wouldn’t allow dogs, and Ann Mul-

~‘ len said she felt that, although they
couldn’t take Fred with them, they
.also couldn’t take her away from
T the mailman.

“For her to move in with the i

Liggetts was the only way we could
move,” confessed Mullen.

That was all right with Liggett,
she said, because “Fred, all her life,
has come and knocked on my door
to play with our two dogs.”

“When the kids all grew up and
moved away, I guess Fred was lone-
ly and started taking up with me,”
recalled the mailman. She’s been

Bohannon reaches St. John’s

Hyde Park rounds. Fred-is there
waiting. She dogs his footsteps, stop-
ping along the route for lunch, from
10 am. until they reach the Liggett
home between 3 and 4 in the after-
noon.

“Fred walks about four miles
with me every day,” Bohannon said.
“She’s with me the whole time
rain, heat, cold, whatever.”

Fred knows where all the water
spigots, are along the way. She ap-
proaches her favorites and looks ex-
pectantly up at Bohannon.

“I’ll tell you a cute story about

that,” Bohannon chuckled. “We

She knows that every time they re- .
turn to the car, she’ll get a” biscuit ‘-

from Bohannon. .

“You have to use common sense
about giving dogs biscuits,” Bohan-
non said seriously. “Some day, you
might not be there and they
wouldn’t understand why they
didn’t get one.” .

Bohannon said Fred is a very in-
telligent dog and has minded him
always -- except once. That was
when the dogcatcher cruised by and
asked if she were his dog. Planning
a quick cover-up job, Bohannon
said, well, she was with him. The
dogcatcher said, “Prove it. Call

intheir front porches, not just to

cat. She didn’t come when he

called, but luckily, the dogcatcher
looked the other way.

Somehow, everybody seems to
look out for Fred. ACcording to B0-
hannon, she has no conception of
what traffic is all about, but she
never has been hit by a car.

And fight? Only in self-defense.
“She will never instigate a fight her-
self. She’s very friendly and doesn’t
understand when another dog wants
to fight,” Bohannon said.

Fred has a healthy respect for
cats, too. . '

Bohannon tells about the time
there was a litter of kittens “over on
Dakota.” “1 said, ‘Come on up here',
Fred, and see what’s here.’ When

she leaned" over to see the kittens, -

the mother cat came flying. Fred
steers clear of that house now.”

“She’s kinda’ shy of Edison, too,
because that’s where she got stung
by a bee,” Bohannon recalled.

Otherwise, life on the mailman’s
route is idyllic. Pe0ple step out on
re-
ceive their mail but to call out a
friendly greeting to Fred. Stories
about the friendly dog are numer-
ous.

Mary Esther Parker, one resi-
dent on the route, said Fred’s repu-
tation goes beyond the neighbor-l
hood. Whenever the Hyde Park
Garden Club meets, Fred’s name in-
variably comes up. “Did you see
her today?” “Is she all right?”

And workers along the route
know to hold onto their sandwiches
during lunch break because Fred is
always looking for a handout.

At St. John’s Episcopal Church
and Day School, an employee tells.
of coming upon a priest who
seemed to be talking very earnestly
to the ground. A closer look re-

vealed he was carrying on a serious .,

conversation with Fred.

Most days, Fred just moves hap-
pily along, anticipating Bohannon’s
every move. 0n hot summer days,

slightly by getting a couple of hous-
es ahead and relaxing in the shade
until he can catch up.

Soon, there’ll be no more catch-
ing up for Fred.

Nobody knows just what will
happen to “Mighty Manfred the
Wonder Dog” when DaVid Bohan-
inon the mailman retires. But every-
‘body is concerned about the famil-
iar twosome.

“Fred may retire with David,”
said the dog’s owner. “We are‘talk-

purpose" of experimentation on zoo animals is to study the cause and therapy of disease in
the animals, "many animals normally held only in zoos can provide models of disease or
other mental or physical characteristics very useful in experimental biology. "

Also, the Morris Animal Foundation in Denver recently reported that it had set up a panel
of advisors to give it a "sense of direction" in research in the zoo and wildlife field. The
panel developed an outline that included study of captive animal reproduction and space re-
lationships, stress, nutrition, etc. , clinical disease, and the preparation of publications
and films for veterinary schools, etc. The names of those serving on the panel were listed
as follows:

Participants in the Morris Animal Foundation zoo and wildlife panel who met in Denver June 3, 1973, were,
clockwise from left: Stephen W. J. Seager, M.V.B., M.R.C.V.S., University of Oregon Medical School, Foundation
research Fellow; Gen. Wayne 0. Kester, D.V.M., USAF (VC), Ret., Denver, Foundation consultant; Lester E.
Fisher, D.V.M., director, Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago, Foundation consultant; Mark L. Morris, Jr., D.V.M., Ph.D.,
Topeka, Kan., Foundation trustee; John Doyle, M.D., consultant to the Louisville (Ky.) Zoo, Foundation trustee;
William I. Gay, D.V.M., Phil, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., Foundation trustee; Theodore Reed,
D.V.M., director.National Zoologicat Park, Washington, D.C.; William J. Tietz, Jr., D.V.M., Ph.D., Dean, College
at Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, and Roger Caras, East Hampton,
N. Y., Foundation Zoo and Wildlife Vice President, presiding.

The names of the panelists are interesting. It can be seen that Mr. Roger Caras
and Dr. John Doyle, Viee~President and Director respectively of the Humane Society of
the United States, are serving along with William I. Gay, DVM, a high ofﬁcial of the
National Institutes of Health. Thus, with HSUS ofﬁcials serving on the same zoo and wild-
life panel with a high NIH ofﬁcial, it is understandable that the HSUS proposes only minor
amendments but is in no position to oppose the take-over of zoos by the Federal animal-
using agencies as provided for in the Whitehurst-Hatﬁeld zoo bill.

Both the National Institutes of Health and the Institute for Laboratory Animal Resources
are members of the National Society for Medical Research, which exists to promote the pro-
curement and use of laboratory animals. Many, if not all, of ILAR's activities and publica-
tions : re supported by the National Institutes, of Health and other Federal animal-using agen-
cxes. An article on the ILAR in Federation Proceedings in April, 1974, makes clear in few
words that the ILAR acts as a sort of salesman or broker between suppliers and users of
laboratory animals.r The same article states that the ILAR "is considering the potential
use of zoo animals in behavioral and reproductive research. " [It is interesting to observe
that both Lester Fisher, DVM and Director of the Lincoln Park Zoo, and Mr. William Conway,
Director of the Bronx Zoo, serve on IIAi‘i. advisory committees]. Ominously, the article
states that the I'LARis ”aceempiishments, activities and goals reflect the changing patterns
and growth of research and resources in the United States."

The "patterns and growth of research and resources" in this country are indeed changing.
Zoo animals and wildlife are becoming "resources" and the "changing patterns" include:

1) Animal behavior experiments in which animals are tortured, tormented and
terrorized, with or without prior mutilation or drugging.

2) "Reproductive research" in whiCh experimenters involve themselves inti-
mately in the sexual activities of animals.

Probably the biggest favor humane societies have ever conferred upon research was
to call for the breeding of zoo animals, which entails "reproductive” research. These studies,

CHEAPLY- VAL UED Z 00 ANIMALS:
. “THE BIG PUSH ” and PREY— KILLING

RECAP

In 1971, Rep. G. William Whitehurst introduced a bill which would turn zoos into
experimental laboratories. His aide told us then that the bill was assured of easy
passage because there was a "big push" to enact it, but he didn't say where the
"big push" was coming from. The Humane Society of the United States and the
American Humane Association were supporting the bill, but they didn't indicate
where the really big push was coming from, either. Then in its September 1973
Bulletin, the National Society for Medical Research spilled the beans. It re-
ported that the annual meeting of the American Association of Zoological Parks
and Aquariums, to be held in October of that year, was being paid for in part

by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, which appropriately can be
described as the vivisection arm of the National Academy of Sciences. THAT
was a really "big push": the AAZPA and the ILAR together represent a very
formidable force.

A companion to Mr. Whitehurst's zoo bill was introduced in the Senate by Sen.
Mark O. Hatfield; the numbers are now H. R. 13004 in the House and S. 2774
in the Senate. The legislation sets up still another Federal agency, and de-
livers into its hands jurisdiction over zoo animals. One might think that by
now every humanitarian and every humane society in this country would know

' what the Federal agencies do to animals,-yet the bill is being supported by most
of the major humane societies and-wildlife groups.

During hearings on the zoo bills on January 23, 1974, called on only a few hours' no-
tice, not one humane society or zoo director testified against penetration of the Federal
animal-using agencies into zoos. The Committee for Humane Legislation, lobby arm of
Friends of Animals in New York City, testified against the bill in toto but theirs was the
only dissenting voice. The Humane Society of the United States proposed some meaning-
less amendments, none of which would prevent zoo animals from falling into the hands of
the Federal animd-using agencies. ’

 

The Federal animal-using agencies are very much a part of the plans to use zoo ani-
mals for research. They were present at the 1973 annual meeting of the American Asso-
ciation of Zoolological Parks and Aquariums in Houston in 1973. The National Institutes
of Health wrote to a Congressman on May 14, 1974, admitting that while the ”principal

Gentlemen:

Something has been brought to my attention just recently which greatly
upsets and.distaabs me, and.I woulyd like to hear your side of the story.

-For a long time I have supported your organizations, and I have also
supported United Action for Animals, Inc. especially when Eleanor Seilig
‘was alive. I felt then, and.do now, that hers was the only animal organ:
ization truly dedicated to finding alternatives to the use of live animals
for research. From what I have read of what gnin goes on in.research

labs, I don't know how those men (can I truly call them.that?) can.live
with themselves. But then, since I am 69 years old, I know that some
people will do anything if they get enough money to do it.

However, I have a friend.in Fund For Animals who sent me the enclosed,
and that is very disturbing to me, especially since I am involved with
the renovation of the Zoo Atlanta right now, and serve as a Director of
the Mbmbers Guild of Friends of Zoo Atlanta - the fundraising arm of FOZA.
If I had any idea at all that any zoo animal was being turned over to re-
search labs it would be the end of my association with.them, and the end
of my support¢ I would also encourage all the people I have had join the
FOZA, to give up their membership for this reason, and I know they would.
I would also make sure the general public knew about it.

It is inconceivable to me that any Zoo would go along with such an idea -
turning over unwanted or excess animals to research labs.

It further amazes me that you two organizations would agree to such a'ﬂhing,
and if this is true, then you have both lost any support from.me. I will
admit it has not been great, but I have been.a.member of HSUS and AHA for
many years. I know you have both done outstanding jobs, so cannot possiblV'
understand your support of this - if it is still true.

Please let me hear from.you immediately on.what is a.most important issue
to me.

Thank‘you.

Sincerely,

Ray Gonia Leads Humphrey to Trailer for Trip to New Orleans Zoo

Humphrey the Camel Gets

In Tune With a New Home

By RAY MUELLER

UMPHREY the camel

is no longer the major

attraction at the CR

Critters Co. exotic-
animal farm in Mishicot, Wiscon-
sin. That’s only because he’s no
longer there.

“I feel kind of bad about it. He
was such a part of the family,”
said Rick Gonia, operator of the
farm along with his wife Cathy,
prior to taking Humphrey on a
24-hour trip in his trailer van to
New Orleans There he delivered
the three year-old camel to the
municipal zoo.

“Humphrey was part of our
business inventory,” Gonia
explains. “When an offer for him
came through our exotic-animal
grapevine, we decided to sell
him. The zoo — and it’s a big one
— was looking for a young geld-
ing He ﬁt their needs because of
all the human contact he’s had. ”

That contact is bOund to leave
many area people, especially
youngsters, quite disappointed,
Gonia notes. “Humphrey was
such a celebrity. You would not
believe the number of cars that

were on this road. There were

hundreds on some Saturdays and
Sundays?’

The Gonias obtained Hum-
phrey when he was ﬁve months
old. As he grew to his mature
weight of about 1,200 pounds, he
became a favorite of thousands of
youngsters who visited CR Crit-
ters on school or youth- group
tours or with their families.

During the Christmas season of
1985, Humphrey was part of the
Nativity scenes, along with donk-
eys and sheep, that the Gonias
provided for a number of
churches, mainly in the Two Riv—
ers, Wis., area.

HUMPHREY received mail in
the form of drawings and short
notes. A boy wrote, “Andrew fed
Humphrey. He liked his feed and
he didn’t bite.”

Another youngster wrote,
“Humphrey is big. He likes his
food.” An accompanying draw-
ing quoted Humphrey as saying,
“Hi, I’m Humphrey. Where’s my
food?” .

One girl annotated her drawing
with the statement, “Nicole is
riding Humphrey in a dream.’

The Gonias also had “a dream’

of training Humphrey as a riding
animal but it quickly vanished in
the reality of liability-insurance
costs.“

“Insurance companies would
not even consider it,” Gonia says.
“And I could not take the risk
myself. We turned down all the
1986 Christmas requests because
of liability.”

HUMPHREY will be used for
riding at the New Orleans zoo,
which already has elephants giv-
ing rides, he notes. ’

CR Critters will be receiving
some kangaroos in trade as par-
tial payment for Humphrey.
Gonia also expects to buy a baby
camel this spring. He said
nothing has been arranged yet
but is conﬁdent that “I’ll find
one.”'

As Gonia departed with Hum-
phrey for New Orleans, he was a
bit worried about how nervous he
might be during the journey in
the trailer. “But a non~stop trip
means less stress and is better for
an animal,” he said as an era
ended for Humphrey at CR Crit-
ters and was set to begin in New
Orleans.

Great American Meatout
is cause to sink teeth into

By Randy Shields

Today is the first day of spring and the third
annual Great American Meatout.

Initiated by the Farm Animal Reform Move-
ment and patterned after the American Cancer
Society’s Smokeout, the Meatout encourages
people to kick the meat habit for at least one
day -— March 20.

In the last 10 years, every scientific panel
studying diet and disease has come to a unani-
mous conclusion: for better health, eat less
meat and more fruits, whole grains and vege-
tables. Among these groups are the Senate Se-
lect Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs
(1977), the National Academy of Sciences
(1982) and the American Cancer Society
(1985)

The principal problems with meat are cho-
lesterol which is associated with heart disease,
stroke and hypertension; saturated fat which
is associated with heart disease, diabetes and
cancers of the breast, colon and prostate; ex-
cess protein which is associated with kidney
disease and osteoporosis; the lack of fiber; ni-
trites; hormones and also pesticides which col-
lect in animal muscle tissue at 10 times the
amount found in plants. ,

‘Super’ salmonella

The New England Journal of Medicine re-
ported in early March that antibiotics given to
farm animals are creating super strains of sal-
monella bacteria. When consumers become
sick by eating meat contaminated by such bac-
teria, the “miracle” drugs —— penicillin, tatra-
cycline, sulfa — are sometimes not effective.
The Journal ’5 article reported that there were
675 cases of salmonella poisoning and four
deaths.

Many nations prohibit the routine use of
antibiotics in animal feed, but the American
meat industry has successfully fought at-
tempts to ban it. » '

Fifty percent of the United States’ produc-'
tion of antibiotics is added to animal feed in
today’s factory farms to promote weight gain
and combat diseases caused by overcrowding
and stress. 7

Most farm animals have been taken off the
land and are now raised indoors. Laying hens

live their entire lives on sloping wires and
crammed four to a 12-inch by 18-inch cage.
They can’t even stretch one wing.

Most breeding sows and veal calves live
their entire lives in stalls so small that they
‘ can’t turn around. Tail-docking, debeaking,
castration and other painful mutilations are

~ performed without anesthetic.

Waste of resources
A meat-based diet also is the waste of re-

sources and environmental destruction. We
simply don’t have the land, water and energy
to continue feeding indefinitely 90 percent of

‘ our grains and legumes to the five billion farm

animals that are raised and killed each year in
America. Most of the world’s water pollution,
deforestation, soil erosion and “desertifica-
tion” is caused by cattle grazing and the plow-
ing of more land for animal feed crops.

The juggernaut of animal agriculture kills
through habitat destruction more wildlife than
hunters and trappers do. In Western states,
tens of thousands of range land “competitors”
such as coyotes and prairie dogs are, trapped,
shot and poisoned to “protect” grazing
livestock.

Thousands of plant and animal species are
threatened with extinction because Central
American rain forests are being burned and
bulldozed in order to graze beef cattle that is
imported by America and sold in fast-food
restaurants.

Historically, healthy societies have eaten
meat as a side dish or on special feast occasions
or not at all. However, we affluent 20th centu-
ry Westerners feast two times or more each
week. In America, the end result is a sickness-
care system which is bankrupting us with
costly to treat and largely preventable dis-

- eases. Two-thirds of them are caused by diet.

These diseases also provide the excuse to do
“research” on and kill millions of animals in
laboratories.

What happens when a society severely lim-
its meat consumption? Well, all health breaks
loose. When Denmark was blockaded during
World War I, virtually everyone in the country
was on a vegetarian diet and the death rate fell
by over 30 percent to the lowest level in 20
years.

The German occupation of Norway in
World War II resulted in limited meat con-
sumption. Deaths because of circulatory dis-
eases and diabetes fell dramatically. After both
wars, these countries resumed their standard
meat-based diets and the death and disease
rates returned to “normal” pre—war levels.

We need to put our taste buds and meat
habits into perspective with the waste of natu-
ral resources, environmental destruction, cost-
ly damage to human health and inhumane
treatment and the killing of five billion farm
animals each year. A good day to begin reduc-
ing or eliminating one’s meat consumption is
March 20 --— the Meatout.

Lettuce begin.

Dangerous Animals

; Two months ago, DeKalb County
ofﬁcials were struggling with exactly
how to legislate the ownership of so-
called vicious or dangerous animals.

The effort was prompted by the
tragic death of a 4-year-old south
DeKalb boy who was mauled by three
pit bull terriers belonging to a neigh-
bor. .

The county commissioners here had
three separate pieces of legislation -
all calling for tougher controls over
the keeping of vicious animals.

5 .At a public hearing to discuss the
proposed measures, however, citizens
found huge legal and practical holes
in all.

So, quite correctly, the board ap-
pointed a citizens advisory board to
study the issue and make recommen-
dations on a law that will work. The
committee includes many animal ex-
perts.

_ At this point, the group has come
up with the heart of a pretty good
law, protecting the citizens but not
penalizing the owners of non-violent
animals. '

It deﬁnes what a dangerous animal

— March 20, 1987

is. It explains how such animals
should be cared for - both on the
owner’s property and off. And it sets
forth penalties for those who don’t
abide by the law.

The key to the legislation, perhaps,
is the responsibility it puts on all
animal owners to be aware of how
dangerous their pets are - and to take
precautions against that danger.

Local commissioners wanted some
things made a little clearer. So, they
asked the committee to check into a
couple of areas of concern.

We expect that the committee of 11 ‘

will do that. And with some possible
minor adjustments, their proposals
will become law in a matter of weeks.

The commissioners generally were
pleased with the citizens’,work. And
we can see why. They’ve injected time
and expertise into a pretty thorough
study of a situation that previously
was being approached ineffectively
from a variety of directions.

As a result, there seems to a better
focus on the problem - and the solu-
tion.

DECATUR-DEKALB NEWS/ERA (Atanta) - March 26, 1987

“Dangerous Animal' Panel
Asked To Refine Its Study

By STEVE TEASLEY

While praising the overall work
of a citizens committee on danger-
ous animal legislation, DeKalb’s
board of commissioners neverthe-
less asked the panel last week to
return to the drawing board and
reexamine a couple of specific
areas of commission concern.

DeKalb Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
Manuel Maloof requested the 11-
member group to reﬁne somewhat
its March 17 report on how the
county can best regulate owner-
ship of vicious - or dangerous -
animals. . '

One particular issue that Com-
missioner John Evans wants re-
viewed is containment of animals.

DeKalb’s citizens committee pro-
posed in its report last week a law
that would require owners - when
leaving a dog or other dangerous
animal unattended - to make sure
that it is “within a house, build-
ing, fence, pen or other enclosure
out of which it Cannot climb, dig,
jump or otherwise escape on its
own volition...” ~ .

Mr. Evans said he believes the
proposed law should not leave any
“ﬂexibility” in that area. Forex-
ample, he said tops should be re-
quired on dog pens.

Not all board members agreed
with him.

Commissioner Jean Williams ac-
cused Mr. Evans of picking apart
the group’s legislation: “He is not
going to be happy with anything
else except banning pit bulls.”

It was an attack last November
by three pit bull terriers that
killed a south DeKalb 4-year-old
and sparked the commission’s push
for tougher vicious animal regula-
tions.

“You’re talking about dogs who
kill folks,” said Mr. Evans last
week, responding to his critics.
“This is serious business.”

Still, argued Commissioner Bob
Morris, “This (adding further re-
strictions to the committee’s pro-

posed law) can get to the point that .

it becomes ridiculous.” ,

., Although he recognized that
some board members don’t support
more clearly deﬁned animal con-
tainment requirements, Mr. Ma-

loof nevertheless asked the citizens
committee to look at the issue.

In another area, Mr. Maloof re- .

quested review of a public safety
department concern. Police offi-
cials told the board that the newly-
proposed regulations don’t have
provisions for animal owners who
are repeat offenders.

DEKALB’S COMMISSION con-
ducted public hearings on several
pieces of vicious animal legislation
last January.

And, a number of citizens
showed up to point out flaws in all
the proposed ordinances.

So, the commission directed the
administration to appoint a citi-
zens committee to make recom-
mendations of its own.

On March 17 after two months
of meeting at least once a week,
the group’s chair, Dr. Carmen Bat-
taglia, outlined a proposal to the
commissioners in a work session.

Among other things, the com-
mittee changed the commission’s
language in the proposed law from
“vicious animal” to “dangerous
animal.” .

The report deﬁnes a dangerous
animal as “any animal which con-
stitutes a physical threat to human
beings or other domestic animals
by virtue of a known propensity to
endanger life by an unprovoked
assault or bite so as to cause
serious bodily harm. An animal
trained, owned or harbored for the
purpose, primarily or in part of
animal ﬁghting. Exceptions: An
animal shall not be deemed dan-
gerous if: 1. it bites, attacks or
menaces (a) anyone assaulting the
owner or (b) a trespasser on the
property of the owner or (c) any
person or other animal who has
tormented or abused it or 2. it is
otherwise acting in defense of an
attack from a person or other ani-
mal upon the owner or other per-
son or 3. it is protecting or defend-
ing its young or other animal.”

Dr. Battaglia told the board that
the group’s proposed law “does not
allow any free bites,” meaning it’s
up to the owner to recognize that
he has a dangerous animal and
that he must live up to precaution-

ary requirements within the law.

But, Commissioner Brince Man-
ning, for one, didn’t agree. He said
the deﬁnition of a dangerous ani-
mal might be a “weakness” in the
proposed law.

How can anyone say an animal
has a “known propensity” for vi-

'ciousness unless it has previously

attacked someone? he asked.

Mr. Manning and Dr. Battalgia
also were at odds over whether or
not the committee’s proposed legis-
lation might have prevented the 4-
year-old’s death last November.

The committee chair said it
would have. But, Mr. Manning
claimed that it might not have
since the pit bulls escaped from a
house and attacked the youngster.
There had also been previous ani-
mal control citations against the
owner, ofﬁcials pointed out, claim-
ing that that fact didn’t prevent
the later incident.

THE COMMITTEE’S legisla-
tion outlines the responsibilities of
all owners of any animals in De-
Kalb to keep their pets from harm
ing others - whether the animal is
unattended or under control of the
owner, either on his property or
off.

There are “additional” require-
ments of owners of dangerous ani-
mals. For example, except when
securely conﬁned in a vehicle, no
dangerous animal is allowed off its
owners property unless it is muz-
zled and is under collar and leash
control by its owner.

The proposed law permits
county ofﬁcials to seize and im-
pound dangerous animals when
violations have occurred. And, un-
less certain conditions are met,
animal control ofﬁcers are author-
ized to put the animal up for
adoption or euthanize it.

Owners who violate the pro-
posed law can be ﬁned up to $500
and sentenced to up to 30 days in
jail.

Members of the committee are
Dr. Battaglia, Ernestine Bonhart, .
Dr. Cheryl Braswell, Mary Gat-
tone, Jane Hart, Subira Patricia
Mitchell, Diane Mooreﬁeld, Jenelle
Roberts, Arlene Scarbrdugh, Dr.
George Smith and Maria Zorka.

ATLANTA JOURNAL - March 30, 1987

Savannah fishing ‘
for a sea aquariam

By David Corvette
Staff Writer

SAVANNAH — State and local officials are studying
the economic potential for a sea aquarium here that could
become a major tourist attraction for Georgia.

Sea aquariums are growing in popularity nationwide,
Chatham County Manager Pat Salerno said, and an $88,000
feasibility study expected to be completed in six months
will help determine whether Savannah will seek a piece of
the action.

“Aquariums are the zoos of the ’805,” Salerno said.
“The public is becoming more aware of the aquatic culture
in our lives.”

Indigenous species such as the endangered loggerhead
turtle, spotted sea trout and a variety of sharks are likely
exhibits if the aquarium is built, though supporters also en-

 

vision displays of exotic sea
creatures found off other shores.

. “I foresee a national aquarium

with stuff from all over the cqun-
try,” said County Commissioner
DE Frazier, who initiated the pro-
ject and is one of several local
elected officials who recently toured
the National Aquarium in Baltimore
for ideas. “I’d like dolphins, whales,
everything —— a real conglomeration
of things. ,
. . “Right now we’re just looking at
it lll terms of what it can do for Sa-
vannah,” she said. “It would create
jobs and be a learning tool for
schools. It would increase tourism
and develop a new source of reve-
nue for Chatham County.”

No site has been selected, but
the consultants conducting the feasi-
bility study are giving some thought
to a suggestion to expand an exist-
ing aquarium operated by the Uni- -
versity of Georgia Marine Extension
Servrce on nearby Skidaway Island.

‘ . “The ideal thing is really here,”
saidDr. Jay Calkins, director of the
inarme extension service. “This is
[about the size aquarium a city this
size could support.”

. .The UGA aquarium has dozens
pf.,huge, illuminated saltwater tanks
with heavy glass windows that look
out on a darkened exhibit hall. Visi-
tors can file by the windows and
yiew the marine creatures, which
are identified by signs marking each
display. ‘.
'- ,The aquarium has no star at- i
ractions such as Marineland’s T?
Shamu the Whale, Calkins said. But 33

it does have a few unusual charac-

ters — Pinkie the albino logger-

head, for example, and small dog-
fish sharks that enjoy “dancing” on
the water’s surface so much their
tank was netted to keep them from
jumping out.

The Skidaway aquarium drew
an estimated 100,000 visitors last
year, according to Calkins. With 680
acres of state-owned land bordering
both the Skidaway and Wilmington
rivers, the site has plenty of room
for expansion and. parking and an
ample supply of water to replenish
the tank. Although Calkins’ sugges-
tion has gained at least some atten-
tion from the aquarium planners,
Commissioner Frazier said she
would want to see a facility in Sa-
vannah proper, not 30 miles away
on Skidaway Island. '

“I’m trying to create tourism
for the downtown area,” she said.
“We need more things that families
can do here. Now they just come in
to Savannah, leave the airport and
go to Hilton Head.”

The need for a major tourist, at-
traction in Savannah provided the
impetus for the aquarium pr0posal.
A state Department of Industry and
Trade study several years ago iden-
tified the city as the top tourist des-
tination in Georgia and recommend-
ed development of a popular
recreational facility in the coastal
area, Salerno said.

“An aquarium fits Savannah
quite well, being the premier coast-
.al community in Georgia, and it’s
just taken off from there,” Salerno
said. “The project has garnered a
lot of support.”

”’ Funding for the feasibility study

comes from $20,000 grants from the
governor’s office and the Savannah
Port Authority, with the remaining
$48,000 provided by the county, Sa-
lerno said. Economics Research As-
sociates of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
and Cambridge Seven of Cambridge,
Mass, are conducting both financial
and conceptual planning.

The cost of the aquarium has
been estimated at $20 million, but
Salerno stressed, “That’s just a
number right now.” The consultants
are researching a variety of funding
sources, including private contribu-
tions as well as state and local gov- '
ernment sources, he said.

The study also is examining the
prospect of competition from an
aquarium project under way in
Charleston, SC, Savannah’s sister
city only 100 miles north.

Design work is complete, and
between $10 million and $13 million
in'state and private funds has been
located for a 50,000-square-foot
South Carolina Marine Science Mu-
seum that is expected to draw

For Rani the elephant, life is a concrete jungle in Birmingham’s back

Big TOp or

ro ck bottom?

by CARMEL FITZSIMONS » :1

FOR RANT the elephant,
the back streets of . Bir-

mingham are a vast-

concrete exercise-yard
where she pounds the
pavements for two hours
every morning. '
It’s not just Showmanship;

the derelict site where the Big -

Top sits is too stoney for her
sensitive feet. . 7 . ,

’ The ringmaster of - Gerry
Cottle’s circus in Birming-
ham, Martin Lacey, blames
Rani’s plight on animal rights
campaigners. ‘ The loony
Left can’t leave circuses
alone. We can’t go to the park
where the animals can exer-
cise easily because the
councils ban us. We end up
stuck on the edge of town, on
a rubbish dump.’ '

Last week animal rights
campaigners
another circus—at Blackpool
Tower—as an ‘ animal Bel-
sen.’ The RSPCA, with some
reservations about the voca-
bulary, supports the protest
but does not single out any
one circus. The society is not
seeking individual reform. It
wants total abolition.

Blackpool Tower Circus is
one of the few static circuses
in Britain. The ring is at the
base of the famous tower and
during the 20—week summer
season animals are kept in
rooms in an underground
labyrinth beneath. Stefan
Ormrod of the RSPCA says:
‘ It’s like going into the bowels
of a large hotel.’

Although the animals do not
arrive until June, animal
rights campaigners are
already protesting at the lack
of natural light and the
limited exercise facilities
which they say are available.

Mr Ormrod says the prob-

described”

lems of Blackpool are th

problems of every circus. "

‘ Under current legislation
there is nothing illegal taking
place, but we believe there is
never anything acceptable
about the use of performing
animals ‘
environment, anywhere.’

In Birmingham Mr Lacey

allowed us to look round his

Big Top but refused to let us
bring an RSPCA official.
‘ They just talk a load of
waffle,’ he said. .,

There are 20 big cats in his.

circus, all of which travel in
‘ beast. Wagons ’ — mobile
cages. Athough the sawdust
was fresh and there was
plenty of water, space looked
limited and before the five
o’clock show the tigers were
relentlessly pacing figures of
eight in their cages.

‘ That is because they can
hear the music ’ said
Lacey. ‘ The cages are mobile
bedrooms, that’s all. No one
protests because I spend eight
hours a day asleep in an area
6 ft by 3 ft. Animal loonies
don’t understand that big cats
sleep 18 hours a day.’

Andrew Greenwood, the vet

in a deprived-

.;..

who advises the Association ,.
of Circus Proprietors, says he

finds circus animals in good
health and their lives are
‘ structured, positive and
achieving.’ The RSPCA
baulks at this line. It is true,

says Mr Ormrod, that there is E;:_
no overt cruelty but he finds 1‘
the quality of the animals’ _

environment ‘ abysmal.’

The RSPCA wants circuses

at least to be subject to the

provisions of the Zoo Licens- :

ing Act of 1981 which requires
rigorous inspection of all
premises to satisfy require-
ments about health and

«Quality of life.

Gorilla home 1

Don McKay’s March 12 letter
criticized the donation of money to
build a gorilla habitat at the Dallas
Zoo instead of addressing the
needs of homeless people. McKay
overlooked the benefits that this
new gorilla habitat will have not
only for the animals, but for the
people of Dallas.

The gorilla habitat is a privately
funded exhibit that will be part of
the SS-acre zoo expansion, “The
Wilds of Africa." When completed,
the Dallas Zoo will receive na-
tional and international attention,
draw tourists and conventions and
make Dallas an attractive city for
corporate relocation. This will add
not only to the quality of life for
Dallas residents, but benefit the
city's economy.

McKay's sarcasm reveals his
lack of knowledge about the role of
zoos today. With the growing
threat to animals in the wild, zoos
play a vital role in breeding, re-
search, education and (unfor-
tunately) act as last refuge for

many species on the brink of ex-

tinction.

Focus / THE WILD UNITED KINGDOM

Donkey gets a kick from

By Jane Eisner
Knight-Bidder News We.
0NDON - It is difficult to say
whether the recent
eadiine-grabbing tale of Blackie
the donkey stems more from the
British obsession with animals in distress
or fffom Fleet Street’s obsession with
itse .

bo'll‘here's ample historical evidence for
t .

This is, after all, a nation that will rally
to even the faintest signal of a bird or
mammal in need. A nation that invented
the term “animal welfare" and now has
refined it to an art.

A nation that generously supports such .
e

charities as the Mule Society, ,
National Fancy Rat Society, the British
Hedgehog Preservation Society, and the
Tortoise Trust.

A nation that contributes more to the
Royal Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals than to a similar
group trying to prevent cruelty to
children.

This is also a nation with lots of tabloid
newspapers, most of them based on

- London’s Fleet Street They are the kind
of tabloids with headlines 6 inches thick
next to photographs of scantily dressed
women. and they will fight each other for
readers with the same passion that the
Rare Breeds Survival Trust employs to
rescue the endangered Gloucester Old
Spot pig.

Very often these two British obsessions
coincide. Last year. for example, front
pages were filled with the plight of a
group of toads that were being flattened
by the score as they crossed a road from
one pond to another for mating purposes.

Sure enough, quick as one could say
" eve-struck amphibians," a citizens‘

brigade mobilized to traffic and
MM‘C‘W the toad! ‘0 u- destination.

, Settlement for Alleged Abuses. ‘

By Perry Lang

The corporate owners of three Bay
Area pet stores have agreed to pay
$150,000 in fines for alleged abuse and
mistreatment of animals. '
The fine is part of a settlement to end a
'2-year~old lawsuit against Docktor Pet Center
‘ 1' , Inc, the largest pet store chain in the country,
.an investigator for the San Mateo district at-
torney’s office said yesterday.

The settlement, signed by San Mateo Su-
perior Court Judge Thomas McGinn Smith,
applies to Docktor Pet Centers in San Bruno’s

, Tanforan Shopping Center, San Jose’s Eas-

" tridge Mall and Pleasanton’s Stoneridge Cen-
ter. Also named as a defendant was Randy J.

, Balls, the former manager of the three fran-
.chises.

The'three stores, according to an under-'0

cover investigator’s report, allegedly sold sick
animals, beat some animals to death and prac-
ticed veterinary medicine without a license.

According to court records, an undercov-
er humane society officer once saw a sick
chihuahua at the San Bruno store stuffed into
a bag and placed in a freezer with a dead dog
during an unannounced inspection of the
shop.

“This was a particularly sad case, not only
for the animals that were abused, but also for
the consumers who got animals, took them
into their homes and watched many of them
die," said John Wilson, San Mateo deputy dis
trict attorney.

In addition to the fine, the settlement also

1 gnawing at I
1' residents

The Nightmare on Roxbury Lane, a
grisly suburban horror story of political
intrigue, neighborhood terror, legal ma—
neuverings and blood on the sidewalks,
has really turned nasty now.

Ald. Judy Zanca of Des Plaines, owner
of two big dogs that neighbors say have
roamed free and harassed residents for
several years, is refusing to apologize for,
or issue any further statements about, a
recent incident in which her dogs report-
edly attacked and killed a pet Yorkshire
terrier owned by a family across the
street. .

In return, Greg and Lisa Thoma, the
owners of the dearly departed Yorkie, ~
have ﬁled a damage suit against Zanca

 

 

Hometowns

 

Eric Zorn

 

and her husband and have collected 65
signatures on a petition asking that the
dogs be removed from the neighborhood.

“We are scared to death to go out—
side,” said Greg Thoma, 26. He said he
watched helplessly as the Zancas’ dogs
recently tortured and mangled his dog,
Winston. “Everyone’s got stories. Those
dogs have to go.” ‘

“I would no sooner go out with those
dogs around than 1 would try to walk
across the Chicago River,” said Jean
Shaw, another neighbor. ‘

Shaw said the recent mayhem began
when her brother-in-law, Arthur Pennell,
.63, left the house to get a briefcase out
of his car on the evening of March 4.
The Zancas’ dogs, Brutus and Tasha,
had their run of the neighborhood that
evening, despite the- strict leash law in
Des Plaines.

Before the Zancas stopped talking to
the press, they told local reporters that a
careless meter reader must have left a
back yard gate open, allowing the dogs
to escape. Several neighbors interviewed
said that this is the Zancas’ normal ex—
cuse and that the dogs run free at least
once a week. Local utility companies
contacted by The Tribune said their rep-

the area on the day in question.

The dogs, Brutus and Tasha, reported-

held him there, snapping and growling.
Shaw came out to help and also found
herself trapped by the dogs, she said.

DOMESTICATED ferrets have been known to eat their
young, so even if the breeding program delivers healthy young,
Thorne said he still is dealing with a lot of unknowns. -

“We’re operating in the dark. ' -
tion to guide us. We’re not even positive when the breeding season
is, so we’re not sure what to look for.”

A last-ditch effort might involve surrogate mating with the
Siberian polecat, a ferreter animal native to Siberia and almost
physically identical to its American cousin. Currently, the
University of Wyoming in Laramie has the only 12 polecats in North
America. Six of them were donated by the Moscow Zoo, mak-

ing the effort to save the black-footed ferret truly an international ”

affair.
Surrogate parenting has been suggested, “but it is not be-
ing considered at this time,” said Thorne. “The Siberian polecat is a
distinct subspecies, and we’re not that desperate at this time.
Hopefully it’s something we’ll never have to do.”
If it is necessary, he pointed to efforts to re-establish a
rare bird, the dusky seaside Sparrow. “There were no males so they
crossed the females with the nearest male relatives. Eventu-
ally they were able to genetically back-cross to about 99% purity.”
All this clinical talk of saving a species, surrogate parent-
ing and artificial insemination is not without a light side. Thorne
gets some kidding from colleagues and others about his
matchmaking attempts. “People ask me if I’ve tried dirty movies,
wine and candles or feeding them ground-up elk antlers (an
alleged aphrodisiac favored in Asia). If I knew of anything like that
that worked, I’d try it.” -

of the males are believed to be sexually mature — one

named Dean and the most recent addition, called Scarface. Scarface
was the last ferret captured in Meeteetse and he was kept in
isolation, first in Laramie and later in Sybille, until he was shown to
be free of disease.

“At this time we have not had any breeding, which is dis-
appointing to everyone involved,” said Thorne. “We believe they
are seasonal breeders, reaching sexual maturation in March,
so we may not get any breeding out of them this year. But we
haven’t given up yet.”

He has tried artificial insemination using a process called electro-
ejaculation. Both Dean and Scarface have been anesthetized and
small probes inserted in their rectums. A low-level electric current is
run through the probe, stimulating the unconscious animal. So far, -
the females have it easier. Their urine is simply tested for evidence
of ovulation.

Advisers from the National Zoo in Washington, DC, visited Sybille
recently to try insemination using a microscopic technique developed
at the zoo. It failed after Scarface —- whom researchers believe has
.bred before —— proved to be an inadequate donor.

“It was a big disappointment to everyone involved,” said
Thorne. “We got a small amount of Sperm but not enough. We’re
going to have to re—evaluate our plans. We don’t know wheth-
er it’s our bad luck or other problems involving reproductive fit-
nws.” .

The only previous attempt to breed black-footed ferrets in
captivity was at a US. Fish and Wildlife service in Maryland in the
1970s with ferrets from a colony in South Dakota. Two litters
of five were delivered in two successive years by a female named
Granny. Eight of the young were stillborn and two others
lived only two days. Granny showed no interest in her offspring.

NEW YORK TIMES - April 14, 1987

 

Siberian cousins are
studied in effort to
,save species.

 

LARAMIE, Wyo.

S the annual breeding season

nears its end, only one pair

of the 18 black-footed ferrets

. . in captivity here has mated

_ ~‘and it is too early to tell if the mating

'rwas successful. Still, scientists were

heartened by it because it indicates

- that at least one of the males in cap-

;tivity is active and fertile, according

-to Tom Thorne, a wildlife research
Weterinarian here.

-" Meanwhile, scientists are already

'working on experimental breeding

"techniques they will use next spring
in their effort to save the nearly ex-
tinct species.

, Among other steps, they will be
,studying six Siberian ferrets sent
LLfrom Russia recently to help them
“learn more about how ferrets breed.
,fOfficials of the Wyoming Game and
Fish Department hope to use the Si-
fpberian ferrets to develop methods of
,artificial insemination, measuring or
gfaltering hormone cycles and other
techniques that could be applied to
‘the black-footed ferrets. Biologists
have been working for months with
“.scientists at the National Zoo in
.. Washington to perfect a technique of
{artificial insemination, which is diffi-
- cult to achieve without surgery in fer-
rets and similar species.

f‘l’rairie Dog Decline

-. The ferrets at the closely-guarded
,.laboratory near here were taken
.;from a prairie dog town near Mee-
teetse in west-central Wyoming. In
the late 1800’s ferrets were found
"from the Missippi River west. As
‘rfarmers moved against the prairie
‘ dogs that were wiping out their crops,
'the ferret population declined.
" “Everything in a natural syStem
,"has value,” said Harry Harju, super-
'visor of biological services for the
"state Fish and Game Department.
~ “Just because the value may not be
i'obvious to humans does not mean
”they may not have immense potential
“Name.” _ '
A Federal captive breeding pro-
gram in the 1970’s produced success-
* ~ful matings in mid-to-late March. Mr.
" Harju said he had hoped the ferrets
gwould breed naturally this year. '
Several of the females may have
-'experienced what he described as
"’f‘low intensity periods of heat.” But
‘ only one of the males responded. Lit-
" tie is known about the breeding habits
of black-footed ferrets in the wild but
males in other ferret species exhibit
very aggressive behavior, he said.
Biologists began observing and pro-
tecting the black-footed ferrets in
their Wyoming habitat in 1981, when

. from the Moscow Zoo through an ar-

 

 

 

-, members of the species, which had'

been written off as extinct, were
sighted. The ferret population at first
showed a wavering cycle, but as it
began to decline the effort to try
breeding them in captivity accelerat-
ed. The program suffered a serious
setback in 1985, when the first six fer-
rets captured for the program died of
distemper. Ferrets captured since

'then have been vaccinated against

the ailment.
‘We Haven’t Lost a One’

Early additions to the captive
colony brought the number to 17. In

late February, state and Federal
wildlife workers, keeping a close

watch on the Meeteetse site, caught a
4-year—old male black-footed ferret,
making a total of seven males and 11
females in the breeding project.

“We haven’t lost a one,” said Mr:

Harju. “They’re thriving on a diet of
cat food, hamsters and prairie dogs,
of which Wyoming has an ample sup-
ply.” He said scientists would con-
tinue looking for other blackfooted
ferrets in the Meeteetse area.

the Soviet Union March 1, are on loan

'rangement effected by officials of the
New York Zoological Society. Sibe-
rian ferrets, which are not endan—

' gered, are believed to be more closely
. related to black-footed ferrets than

are other North American ferrets. No
cross-breeding efforts are planned.

The new animals from Moscow will,
augment two Siberian ferrets ac~
quired earlier from the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service and four do-
nated by Canadian and United States
zoos.

The nery arrived Siberian ferrets
have already begun to breed. Game
and Fish Department officials hope to
use their offspring totest breeding
methods before they are tried on the
black-footed ferrets. Additionally, a
female Siberian ferret could be used
as a surrogate mother if a black-
footed female neglected a litter. Al-
though such neglect is rare in the
wild, officials said it might be more
common in captivity. «

Eventually, biologists here hope to '
raise enough black-footed ferrets in
captivity to introduce young animals
to the wild in prairie dog towns. But
such a move would require more ex-
tensive study of factors important to
the animal’s survival in the wild.

ST. JOHN’S, Newfoundland (AP) '
é -— Seal hunters are having better
luck on land than those hunting off-
shore. . -

Two large sealing vessels partic-
ipating in the first offshore seal
hunt in five years have been search-
ing the coasts of northern New-
foundland for seal herds for about a
week.

But federal fisheries spokesman
Ern Collins said last week the two
ships have taken only about 600
seals between them, while land's-
men on the northeast coast have
taken almost 4,000 seals.

Collins says the vessels are hin-
dered by heavy ice and, since it is
late in the season, most seals al-
ready have scattered.

The lack of seal pelts has result-

ed in little work for the seal pro-

ATLANTA CONSTITUTION - April 17, 1987
U.S. to allow ‘
patenting of
2‘ gene Splicing

:Animals with new traits
’ covered by the decision

The New York Times

WASHINGTON —- The federal
:government, in a decision with
. broad moral and ethical implica—
.tions, said Thursday that it was
.‘clearing the way for inventors to
patent new forms of animal life
- created through gene splicing.
‘ The policy will also allow the
’ patenting of animals with new traits
produced by a host of new repro-
~ ductive technologies.
' .The policy, adopted by the Com-
,merce Department’s Patent and
;Trademark Office and scheduled to
be published early next week,
makes the United States the first
country to patent animals.

The policy specifically bars the
patenting of new genetic character-
'istics in humans. But one official of
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Of-
fice acknowledged that the decision
1 could eventually lead to commercial
protection of new human traits.

“The decision says higher life
Tforms will be considered and it
could be extrapolated to human be—‘

tor of organic chemistry and bio-
technology in the patent office. “But
for the time being, we are not going
to consider applications involving
.human life.”

The policy has important eco-
- nomic consequences for the biotech-
‘ nology industry and agriculture, the
'7 fields in which much of the re-
. search is being conducted, according
’ to scientists and farming experts.

The policy recognizes the pace -

of breakthroughs in reproductive
technologies involving animals.
. Genes from different species are
. mixed, to reduce the time normally
needed to produce such commercial-
ly valuable traits as cows that give
more milk or pigs that have less
fat. It often takes years to produce
commercial traits using natural, se-
lective breeding, the scientists said.
In addition, the research Opens
the possibility of creating new kinds
. of livestock, and researchers say the
technology eventually will make it

possible to mix animal, plant, mi-

crobe, and human genes into animal

embryos to produce custom-de- ;

signed animals.

,7 For instance, researchers at the
‘ Department of Agriculture’s re-
? search station in Beltsville, Md.,
'. have inserted a human growth hor-

" mone gene into pig embryos to

_make pigs grow faster. The experi-
sment produced a line of pigs that
‘has passed the human trait to off-
,spring. The animals are leaner than
naturally bred pigs, but they suffer
'from several debilitating ailments,
fincluding crossed eyes, severe ar-
'thritis in the joints and susceptibil-
. ity to disease. _

, Researchers at the University of
California at Davis have fused a
,goat embryo with a sheep embryo
.and produced a living biological chi-
mera they call a “geep,” a less than
hardy animal that cannot reproduce.

In several other universities and
private laboratories, scientists are
deve10ping methods to clone precise
"replicas of cattle, sheep, pigs, goats
and other livestock by carefully

splitting embryos when they are .

only days old. The ability to pater};
such deveIOpments, according ,to
those familiar with the situation,
could be worth billions of dollars to
the inventors and companies that
commercialize thetechnology.

_ 'Police“ Dog Isn‘t W
Same as People

Recently a police dog was shot in the
mouth and the kid who did it was arrest-

ed because they are saying the dog is a
. police officer.

"W--~———~-... .m

 

Let us look at this situation. Let’s say

there are two kinds of people - police
, officers and those who are not police of-

ficers. Both classes have the same rights.
It is illegal to kill a police officer and it is

, illegal to kill Someone who is not.

Since they put a warrant out for the

;. arrest of the kid whot shot the police dog,

should people who kill dogs that aren’t

; police officers also be arrested?

My reason for bringing this up is that

the shooting of a dog occurred in our
‘ neighborhood. The man who did it got a
. slap on the wrist.

I feelthere should not be double stan-
dards for treating one dog special be-
cause of its abilities or special training.
The dog that was murdered also had a
very important job. He was a family pet.

That involves more responsibilities than

anyone can imagine.

I think something should be done to
stop this cruelty to animals. Too many
people are solving the problems of stray
animals with firearms. These animals
are peoples’ pets and discharging a fire-
arm in a residential area can be danger-
ous to the children in the neighborhood.

If the police dog gets treated like a
police officer then I believe other dogs

'should be treated as citizens as well.

CANON CITY — The stock pens at Fremont

Correctional Facility used to lead to the
slaughterhouse, a granite-block Depression-
era building that still stands nearby.
_ But some wild horses at the prison now
1 have a better future ahead of them, though
they still enter in raw fright, bound by new
limits they do not understand.

The 100 or more wild horses, captured in
roundups by the federal Bureau of Land Man-
agement and then sent here, will leave Fre-
mont halter-broken, some also saddle-broken,
ready for adoption by anybody willing and
able to care for them.

In the month between, a dozen prison in-
‘_ mates will struggle to bring the horses from
their feral state to domesticity. There are
hard, long hours, few days off and a better-

_ than-even chance of injury, from rope burns

to broken legs. .

. But there has been no lack of inmates will-
, ing to work here. _
“When you’re out here yOu don’t see the
_- walls and fences,” said inmate David McCord,
; 35. “When we go back in at night, I probably

- seem hard to talk to, real down. It’s because
0 when I go back inside, I realize I don t really
. have the freedom I feel out here.”

Last week, inmates worked to load 48 bro-
: ken horses into an 18-wheeler bound for Tulsa3

while others labored at new corrals that will
give the prison program the capac1ty to hold
300 or more horses. . - ‘ - _ _

More convicts will join in the program, m-:

‘i eluding some at the state women’s prison:

looking at the Colorado program with v1310ns
of their own. '

“The Bureau of Land Management has
about 10,000 horses in holding facilities,” said
Walter J akubowsky, a BLM official who
works with the inmates. “These horses are
hard to adopt out because they’re Wild. The
inmates here help take off the rough edges. In
our small way, we’re helping knock down that
backlog.” . ' -

In the tim since the program began, those
who have run it have learned that few inmates
regard it as just a job. There has been a
strong tie between men and animals.

“If somebody’s mishandling a
horse, we say, ‘Hey, take it easy.
That horse is as scared as you

. were the day you came through

the doors.’

“There’s a lot of compasSion
going on here,” Billips said. “I

might be presumptuous, but I

think a person on the street just
can’t understand this the way we

do 9’

Billips, 34, grew up on the
streets of New York. He came to
Colorado as a soldier stationed at
Fort Carson, got tangled up in
drug problems and eventually
was jailed for robbery. .

“The way I was using narcot-

as gentle and cobperative as do-
mestic-bred horses.

Still, “It’s sad to see these ani-
mals locked up like we are,” said
McCord, who is in prison for vio-
lation of pawnbroker laws.

Inmates have learned their
skills from horseman Tony Bain-
bridge and veterinarian ‘Ron
Zaidlicz. Both long have been in-
volved in programs to help wild

. horses, whose numbers have

grown across open land in the
West.

Although most horses only are
halter-broken, allowing an owner
to lead it with a bridle, some are
saddled and ridden.

“Some of these inmates are
becoming hellacious bronc rid-
ers,” said Jakubowsky. Among
the best is Oklahoma native Till-
man Smith, 35, jailed “because
my hOuse burned down.” A for-
mer ranchhand and rodeo rider,
he mounts unridden horses about
twice a day.

There is no law against owning a pit bull, an ani-

tenacious fighting ability. There are an estimated
1 million pit bulls in the United States —- less than
' 2 percent of the dog population —-— but they have
been responsible for all three fatal dog attacks this
year and for seven of the 13 fatal attacks last year,
' said Dr. Randall Lockwood of Washington.
, “Even well-bred pit bulls can be more difficult
to own and train,” said Dr. Lockwood, an animal
. behaviorist with the Humane Society of the Unit-
ed States. “Now we’re seeing that this is the macho
' dog to own. Young men who might be inclined to
be irresponsible owners might be attracted to this
If kind of dog.”
He said street gangs in cities such as Chicago
f and Philadelphia have been fighting pit bulls in
the streets and using them as weapons of crime.
“They’re using them the way gangs in the past
have used switchblades and zip guns,” said Dr.
Lockwood. “What makes attacks by pit bulls more
serious and more devastating is that as fighting

dogs they are bred to inflict maximum damage on
opponents. They’re extremely persistent and
many attacks are unexpected and unprovoked.”

The term “pit bull” is not a registered breed but
generally is used to include Staffordshire Bull
Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers and
American Pit Bull Terriers which usually weigh
40 to 60 pounds and have square jaws and muscu-
lar chests.

Jean Sullivan, executive director of the Mem-
phis Humane Society, said she has seen kittens,
dogs and people mauled by pit bulls, a breed show-
ing up more often in the city. '

“It used to be I hardly ever saw one, but now a
week doesn’t go by that I don’t see one or get a com-
plaint about one,” said Ms. Sullivan, adding that

owners of such animals should take extra precaui— .

tions in restraining them. “You don’t leave a load-
ed gun out and say kids shouldn’t pick it up be
cause it’s dangerous.” ‘

Dog Heroesof the Year.

 

 

Here are the exciting stories of tive very special dogs— di finalists in the 1986
Ken-L Ration Dog Hero of the You Awud.

Mike Collins rescued a puppy left to die on a lonely
road —— and seven years later, the dog repaid the favor by

saving Collins’ life. ~
Last October Collins and his dog Tiger — a 7-year-old mixed
breed - were deer hunting near Collins’ home in Klamath Falls,

Oreg.

Without warning, a huge ZOO-pound mule deer sprang from behind a

bush and charged. ’

“He was on me in the
blink of an eye,” said Collins
a 78-year-old retiree.

“When I came to, I was
bleeding heavily from a cut
on my chin and my left leg
was broken. I didn't feel any
pain because I was in shock.
But I knew I could die unless
I did something.”

Collins began crawling on
his hands, dragging his use
less leg behind him, heading
for his pickup truck about
1% miles away.

“Tiger stayed with me
every second,” said Collins

Finally,
near his truck, but he was so
exhausted he couldn't crawl
any farther. Then, he heard

the sound of another pickup

truck nearby. -

Tiger heard it, too, and he
raced off. He planted him-
self rlght in front of the
truck and began barking.

“Tiger kept turmn' g his ’

head in my direction,” said
Collins. “Finally, someone in
the pickup realized that
Tiger was trying to tell them
something. They got out to
investigate and Tiger led
them right to me.”

Collins was taken to a hos-
pital. His leg was broken in
five places and he needed 12
stitches to sew up his chin.

He says he’ll always be
grateful to Tiger for saving
his life. But he added, “I
saved Tiger’s life when
someone abandoned him as a
puppy, so he owed me one.”

Horse trainer Mari Marks
says an Australian sheep dog
named Frankie is her best
friend -— ever since he saved
her from being trampled by
a charging horse.

Mari, 29, was putting a
show horse through its paces
last May while the 3-year-old
dog sat outside the ring.

Suddenly, the horse trip-
ped, threw Mari to the
ground and fell on top of
her, then got up and ran to
the far side of the ring.

"I landed in a sitting posi-

wife Anneliese were asleep
in December 1985 when they
were awakened by the bark-

7- year-old Cairn terrier, and

 

Buddy, a 3-year-old mutt

Even though the tempera
ture was about 27 degrees
below zero, the Schmidts let
the dogs outside.

“When it’s that cold out,
they'll usually be back inside
in a few minutes. But that
night, they refused to come
in,” said Schmidt, of Dickin-
son, N. Dakota

The dogs just kept on
barking. Finally, Anneliese
dressed in warm clothes and
went outside. That‘s when
she heard cries for help com-
ing from a trucker’s ware-
house across the street.

Anneliese told her hus-
band, who grabbed a ﬂash-
light and went outside.

“As soon as Champ and
Buddy saw me, they calmed
down, as if they figured
they’d done their job," he

Schmidt walked into the
warehouse and found a
trucker with a 2,680-pound

“The tire had broken his
leg and he was close to pass

Schmidt. “He’d pulled into

tire and it had fallen on him.
“As I jacked up the tire to

. Shaggy D°9
uves Todd'er

By Kathy Bodovt'tz

. , . At the Benedetti house-
hold 1n Danville yesterday,a

shaggy, mixed-breed family
dog was still feasting on a

hero’s all-steak diet.

Bella — half ‘Wheaton terri-

~ er and half Labrador retriever
—— earned the gourmet vittles

, Tuesday when she helped save .

IB—monthold Steven Benedetti
1 from drowning in the backyard
, swimming pool. ‘

“We were all outside

playing -— Steven, Bella and 1,",

. the boy 5 mother, Mary Ann Bel
nedetti, recalled yesterday. “I

had come inside to go to the

bathroom.”

Moments later, Bella raced
into the bathroom, barking and
crying, then tore back out to the
fenced-in pool. Benedetti quick-
ly followed, and found the tod-
dler floating face down, with
Bella grabbing his arm in her

mouth.

When Benedetti dragged
her son from the pool, he was
blue.

“It was a mother’s night-
~ mare, it truly was,” Benedetti
said. “If it weren’t for Bella, he
- wouldn’t have made it.”

Steven began coughing sec-'

. onds later, the paramedics arriv-

ed, and a doctor declared him

' just fine.

But hundreds of other chil-
dren have not been as lucky. Ac-
cording to the state’s Child

Health and Disability Preven-'

tion Program, drowning is the
No. 1 cause of accidental death
for children between ages 1 and
5.

From 1978 to 1984, 862 chil-
dren in that age group drowned
in California. Of those, 67 per-
cent drowned in backyard pools,
spas and hot tubs, while the oth.
er 33 percent drowned in bath
tubs, toilet bowls and diaper
pails.

Contra Costa ' County is
fourth in the state in the num~
ber of child drownings, behind
Los Angeles, Orange and Santa
Clara counties. '

. The Benedettis had an ex-
pensive fence built around their
pool two months ago to prevent
just this sort of accident. But
apparently one slat was loose
and Steven slipped through.

“You hear about children
drowning,” Benedetti said, “but
I always felt that (their mothers)

weren’t good mothers, that they '

didn’t take care of their chil-

dren. I’m here to tell you it hap ..
pens in a minute, it happens that

quick.” .

Exploration won’t hurt environment

 

By Sen. Frank Murkowski

 

I T seems to be the case in the United
States that officials never put a traf-
fic light on the corner until after some-
one has been hurt. Unfortunately, this
has been our nation’s approach to the
questions surrounding our long-term
energy needs. We never seem to ask
ourselves, where will the oil come
from? Until, that is, we’re in the midst
of an oil crisis. Then we seem to ask,
where did it go? ‘
The 100th Congress has a historic op-
portunity to reverse that trend and
take a major step toward ensuring that
our nation remains less dependent on
foreign oil. In the coming months, we

- will begin debate on what will prob-

ably be the largest energy-related deci-
sion of the late 20th Century —-— oil ex-
ploration inside the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).

SOME ENVIRONMENTAL organiza-
tions argue that Alaska’s environment
would be destroyed if oil exploration
took place in the refuge. These argu-
ments have a familiar ring. Less than
20 years ago, the same organizations
were leading the charge with the same
issues against the Alaska pipeline.

Z They said the same things back then,

and were subsequently proved very
wrong.

Oil has been produced on Alaska’s
North Slope at Prudhoe Bay now for 10
years. Each day, nearly 2 million bar-

rels are shipped through the 800-mile .

trans-Alaska pipeline —— across Alas-
ka’s tundra and permafrost — without
damage to the ecology. That oil amount
accounts for about 25 percent of the to-

tal U.S. production —— a key component.

of the nation’s energy security.

Those who attempt to exploit fear
over the well-being of caribou that live
in ANWR ignore the Prudhoe Bay ex-
perience. The commonly heard asser-
tion that caribou cannot survive along-
side prudent oil development is simply
not true. There were about 3,000 cari-
bou in Prudhoe Bay in 1972. Today that
number has increased fivefold, to
nearly 14,000. There is no either/or
choice. We can have both oil and wild-
life protection.

Opponents of exploration in the ref-
uge also fail to mention that we are
talking about opening only 1.5 million
acres of an 18 million-acre refuge that
has 8 million acres of designated wil-
derness. Even if the coastal plain were
at full development, less than 0.0001

percent (1/ 1,000 of 1 percent) of the re-'

serve would be touched. . . .
Keep in mind the reason the United
States needs oil from Alaska. Our de-

pendence on imported oil has jumped
from 27 percent to 40 percent. That is
significantly greater than the level of
our dependence in the 705, which pre-
cipitated the energy crisis.

The United States must have a bal-
anced energy policy to help us meet en-
ergy needs in the let Century. But we
cannot rely solely on energy conserva-
tion and development of alternative
sources of energy. Although there are
enough petroleum reserves on Earth
to meet worldwide needs for at least
the next 75 years, three-quarters of
those reserves are in the volatile Mid-
dle East. . . . Without question, new
sources of oil must be found.

Remember also that we are talking
only about exploring for oil. There is
no guarantee that any will be found;
and even if Congress gave the go-ahead
today for oil exploration to begin in
ANWR, it would be 10 to 15 years before
oil would be on line and ready to be de-
livered to US. consumers.

The United States has the strongest
environmental laws in the world, and
Alaskans are dedicated to maintaining
clean air, water, and that special Alas-
ka lifestyle. Our laws will ensure that
exploration in the reserve will be con-
sistent with the protection of the other
resources, like caribou, that are impor-
tant to our national heritage. . . .

MEMPHIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL - April 15, 1987

 

 

How much oil does the United
States need? Must the country rely
primarily on oil from the Middle East,
or are there untapped reserves in our
own territory?

One such area that has attracted
the speculation of the Reagan admin-

 

istration and the oil industry is the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,
above the Arctic Circle in Alaska. In
today’s Debate, Rep. Morris Udall (D-
Ariz.), chairman of the House Interior
and lnsular Affairs Committee, ar-
gues that oil exploration in the area

would harm a delicate environment
and wildlife habitat. However, Sen.
Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska) says
Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay oil operations
prove that securing US. energy
needs and protecting the environ-
ment can go hand in hand.

 

 

Alaska’s wildlife must be protected ,

 

By Rep. Morris Udall

 

BOVE the Arctic Circle, in the re-

motest corner of the United.

States, is a land of stark beauty
between Alaska’s Brooks Range and
the Beaufort Sea. The coastal plain of
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
(ANWR), often thought of as a barren
expanse of nothingness, actually
nurses life astounding in its diversity,
richness, and wildness.

Much attention focuses on the Por-
cupine caribou herd, the largest in the
United States, whose annual trek
. across the continent is a source not
only of wonder but of food, clothing,
and livelihood to many native peoples.
But many other creatures depend on
this fragile swath of permafrost as well
—— polar bears, brown bears, musk
oxen, wolves, wolverines, Arctic foxes,
seals,~108 species of birds, and numer-
-ous species of fish — and together they
display the magnificent pageantry of
life in this hostile and delicate world.

Although the term “wildlife refuge”
is arguably a misnomer where animals
are hunted and habitat disturbed, here
it speaks with forceful eloquence. Of
the more than 1,000 miles of Alaskan
coastline above the Arctic Circle, the
100 miles of ANWR coastal plain is the
only coastline not now available for
commercial exploitation. This, indeed,
is a last, true refuge for Arctic wildlife
in America.

These facts are beyond dispute. But
if the Reagan administration, the oil
companies, and their supporters have
their way, even this last haven will be
sacrificed to the insatiable thirst for
more oil. True to form, they tell us we

can exploit this distant, sensitive land

for all its industrial worth without dis-
turbing the wildlife. If the two asser-
tions of development forces were true
-— that the coastal plain harbors vast
oil resources and that they could be de-
veloped without risk — their argu-
ment might be compelling. But their
assertions are at best highly specula-
tive, and at worst deeply in error.

Is there a lot of oil beneath the coast-
al plain? The most honest answer is
that no one knows. Only the most pre-
liminary geophysical work has ever
been conducted, and only one well has
ever been drilled. But a legally man-
dated draft study issued by the Reagan
administration provides some insight.

In Alaska, it matters far less how
much oil is “in place” than how much
is economically recoverable. Alaskan
oil is extremely expensive to find, pro-
duce and transport. Only supergiant
fields are feasible, and then only un-
der favorable economic conditions.

. . . Even if we had oil prices of $33
per barrel and 6 percent inflation,
there would be an 81 percent probabil-
ity that no economically recoverable
reserves of any amount will be found
on the coastal plain. Even if we are
lucky enough to hit on the 1-in-S
chance that we might find any such re-
serves, the strongest likelihood is that
we could produce only about 6 percent
of Prudhoe’s 10 billion barrels. . . .

It is outrageous for an administra-
tion that has actively engaged in dis-
mantling a broad, sensible energy poli-
cy to claim that we need to open this
area up in the name of national securi-
ty. If our national security is at stake,
why has the administration destroyed
funding for conservation and alterna-
tive energy strategies, pushed hard for
relaxation of fuel economy standards,
vetoed legislation to set energy effi-
ciency standards for major appliances,

and opposed many other rational ener-
gy policies, any one of which alone
would replace the energy that could
conceivably be produced from ANWR? .

Industry also has a way of continual—
1y arguing that the one area it is re-
strained from exploring is the one area
where it really has to explore. It was
not long ago that Congress was told in
no uncertain terms that to restrict ac-
tivity in the National Petroleum Re-
serve-Alaska to the west of Prudhoe
Bay was unthinkable because of its
vast potential. A few years and a few
dry holes later, NPRA is yesterday’s
forgotten energy cookie jar.

Perhaps you think that even another
drop of oil is worth it if it can be pro-
duced without risk to the environ-
ment. Certainly, the industry is not shy
about pointing. to its record at Prudhoe

Bay and issuing assurances that all

will be well in ANWR. But Prudhoe
Bay and ANWR are not that much
alike. The coastal plain is a much nar-
rower strip between mountains and
sea and provides habitat for far more
wildlife than Prudhoe.

Moreover, the industry has had only
some 15 years’ experience with wild- ‘
life in the Arctic. . . . Recently pub-
lished studies of wildlife populations
around national parks in the Lower 48
provide very sobering data on the dam-
aging effects of even simple human
constructions —— fences and roads ~—
over periods of 30 to 50 years. . . .

Although the endangered ani-
mals bred at White Oak are sold or
traded to “reputable” zoos and
game farms around the world or re-
turned to the wild, Lukas said the
plantation does not make money on
the expensive endangered species
project.

“This is a conservation pro-
gram,” Lukas said. “We don’t even
make enough to pay for the ani-
mals’ feed.”

According to Lukas, Gilman Pa-
per Co. owner Howard Gilman, who
flies down from New YOrk to spend
weekends at the plantation, is an ar-
dent conservationist committed to
saving rare animals such as the
Florida panther from extinction.

“Most people think we’ve still
got panthers all over the state,”
said Tom Logan, who headsthe
panther recovery project for the
Florida DNR. But Logan said Flori-
da panthers have been “persecuted”
by civilization into the wildest
reaches of the Everglades and two
other south Florida wilderness re-
serves. '

Even there, the panther p0pula-
tion is so small that experts fear
they will soon become extinct. “We
count their numbers in dozens, not
in hundreds,” Logan said, estimating
the Florida panther population at
fewer than 50.

preserved in the state — but never
at a level that we can take for
granted,” he said.

The Okefenokee Swamp, the
giant federal wildlife preserve that
lies on the Georgia-Florida border,
is among the places where young
pagthers Will be released, Lukas
sai .

“The Okefenokee, which has a
corridor to Florida’s Osceola Na-
tional Forest, is one of the most se-
curie places in the state,” Lukas
sai .

The last panther sighted in the
Okefenokee was in the 19308, he
said. In those days, when little was
known about the secretive cats
whose eerie screams and graceful
beauty gave rise to many legends,
panthers were considered fair game
by hunters.

I

Since 1973, the Florida panther
has been on the federal endangered
species list, and in 1979, the state of
Florida, which named the panther
its state animal, passed laws mak-
ing the wanton killing of the big
cats a felony.

Until the capture of the female
panther in South Florida this week,
Big Guy was the only true Florida
panther in captivity in the world.
When he was barely more than a
cub, he was hit by a speeding car in
the Everglades.

Because he has lost his canine
teeth and walks with a slight limp,
the 4-year-old panther cannot be re-
turned to the wild, Lukas said.

But someday his progeny may
bring back the scream of the wild
panther to the Okefenokee and other
wilderness areas of the Southeastern
United States.

JOURNAL/CONSTITUTION - April 18, 1987

zoologist is attempting to breed the Florida panther to a trio of Texas

Special to the Journal-Constitution

WHITE OAK PLANTATION, Fla.
-— The 6,000-acre White Oak Planta-
tion, which sprawls in lush splendor
across the St. Marys River south of
Brunswick, is a fitting habitat for Big
Guy, a Florida panther who may go
down in history as the father of his
subspecies.

The tawny cat, one of the few sur-
viving Florida panthers in the world,
will be bred to others of his kind and,
if all goes well, his progeny will be re-
leased to repopulate wilderness areas
of Florida and South Georgia.

“There have been no other attempts
in North America to put a big predator
back in the wild,” said John Lukas, a
zoologist who heads the plantation’s
breeding program for endangered spe-
mes.

Nor have Florida panthers ever
been bred in captivity.

But because of the plantation’s ex-
traordinary success at breeding other
endangered species, the state of Florida
has a contract with Lukas and his team
at White Oak to undertake a long-term
project aimed at saving the panthers
from extinction.

“They only work with the most dif-
ficult endangered s ies, the ones no-
body else can hr in captivity,” said
Bill Greer, a spokesman for the Florida
De artment of Natural Resources

(D R). “They have state-of-the-art

technology, the best equipment and the
best professionals.”

Lukas is presently attempting to
breed Big Guy to a trio of Texas cou-
gars, the closest living species to the
Florida panther. The half-breed kittens,
when old enough, would be released
into wilderness areas of Florida and
South Georgia.

If the half-breeds adapt successfully
to the wild, they will be followed by

at White Oak Plantation, Fla. A cougars. The half-

breed kittens, once they reach a certain age, would

be released into wilderness areas of Florida and South

pure-bred Florida panthers, which Lu-
kas hopes Big Guy will father.

' Big Guy is now the only Florida
panther in residence at the plantation,
but he is to be joined there in about a
month by a female captured this week
in south Florida.

“This is a long-term, well-thought-
out program,” Lukas said. “When
you’re trying to save a species, the
worst thing you can do is rush it.” ‘

Not only will the cats bred in cap-
tivity have to learn to adapt to the
wild, Lukas said, people also will have
to learn to accept the big predators,
which once ranged the woods and

swamps from Florida to Texas.

“Public attitudes are improving, but
people are still afraid of them,” though
panthers are solitary creatures, non-ag-
gressive toward humans and hunt only
for food, Lukas said.

“They just need to have a little
space of their own, where they can

hunt deer and turkey and armadillo,”
he said.

Lukas, 37, a Hartford, Conn, native
who formerly worked with the endan-
gered species program conducted by
the New York Zoological Society on St.
Catherines Island, was recruited to
manage the White Oak project in 1982.

At White Oak, the animals are kept
in compounds that closely resemble
their natural environments.

Owned by the Gilman Paper Co.,
the plantation is home to 24 kinds of
rare mammals, including endangered

cheetah, antelopes and white rhinocer-

oses from Africa; Aldabra tortoises
from the Seychelle Islands; a Siberian
tiger cub confiscated from a Florida
drug dealer; and 30 species of rare
cranes and waterfowl from all over the
world. '

THE DENVER POST - April 4, 19.87..--

Cookies. We make them for our
loved ones. We offer them as a
cure for the blues. The gluttons
among us hoard them for solitary
consumption.

Considering the vast amount of
pleasure cookies bring us, it makes
sense that we’d bake them for our
pets. Susan Biddle, a Denver Post
photographer, does that for her
golden retrievers.

“I really started making these

treats - they’re more cracker

than cookie, actually - after a
friend sent me a tin of the dog bis-
cuits, a cookie cutter in the shape
of a bone, and the recipe, for
Christmas a few years ago,” says
Biddle, “I thought I’d try them out
as a lark.’.’

, “My dog Wilbur (named after
the pig in “Charlotte’s Web”) was
then 5 months old and went wild
for them. He was such a discerning
animal that it you at a commer-
cial dog biscuit own beside a
much smaller homemade one, he’d
go for the homemade every time.”

Dr. Stephen Warren, a Vail vet?

thinks these dog treats

are a good idea, “if you’re in the
mood to bake.

“We see so many overweight

dogs — maybe as much as 60, per-

 

cent of the (dog) population, that
to discover a recipe like this is ter-
rific. There isn’t anything in this
treat that could harm a dog, and

certainly better than many other
foods given to pets," Warren said.
“Too often our clients are giving
dogs too many treats, mistakenly v
believing them to be OK. They
may very well be overloaded with
calories.” - w
The following is the original reel? '
pe given to Biddle. ' '

Fulton officials '
beginning probe
of pit bull attack

By Wanda Yancey.
and Dick Buerkle
Statt Writers ,

 

S

A teenager injured when he
went to the aid of a child being at-
tacked by a pit bull terrier Satur-
day says he doesn’t “feel like a
hero.” . '

“I’m just happy that I was able
to save that little boy,” said 19-
year-old Patrice Anderson from his
hospital bed at Southwest Commu-
nity Hospital on Sunday. Anderson
underwent surgery Saturday night
for wounds to the groin area and
was “doing fine” this morning, a
hospital spokeswoman said.

Anderson and three friends
were driving down County Line
Road in southwest Atlanta when
they spotted a pit bull attacking 9-
year-old Biko Hand of 2649 County
Line Road.

Anderson, who is 5 feet 9 inch-
es tall and weighs about 157
pounds, said he jumped out of the
car, picked up the largest rocks he
could find and began dropping
them on the dog’s head. He said
the rocks did not deter the animal,
but it turned from Biko to him.

Biko’s father, Willie Hand, said
he had to beat the dog to death
with the butt of a rifle.

“I killed the dog. I broke the
butt of my gun doing so,” he said.
“At first I was going to shoot the
dog, but I realized there were too
many people around.”

Hand said the dog kept up its
attack even after he started hitting
it. .

“I hit him at least three time
before he died,” he said. ' '

Biko, who suffered a deep cut
to his left thigh, was treated and
' released Saturday night.

Anderson “saved my son’s life,”

Hand said. But he “said Anderson-

 

, would not be in the hospital it the?

, dog had been placed behind a fence,
instead of on a chain. Hand said the
. dog escaped from the chain and at-

tacked Biko in his yard.

The dog’s owner, Wade Hampton

' of 2586 County Line Road, refused

T to comment. When the attack oc-
curred Saturday, the Hamptons

. were not at home.

Ron Totten of the Fulton County

,_ Animal Control office said an inves-
" tigation into Saturday’s attack is un-

der way to check for leash law vio-

lations. “We will take a warrant out
. on the owner if evidence shows the
owner was at fault,” he said.

The dog’s body was seized by
animal control officers and was to
be checked for rabies today, said
Robert Fisher, director of Fulton

County Animal and Rabies Control. .~
The dog was registered with the

* rabies control office and had a one-
~ year license due to expire June 14,
i 1987, according to Harold Coleman,

Hand said, “I don’t have any
animosity against the Hamptons.
The dog is dead and no one was
killed. But I believe if anyone is go-
ing to keep a pet of that aggressive
nature, then the owner should se-
cure the pet in a fence where he
cannot hurt innocent pe0ple.”
Although Saturday’s attack was
the first time the dog had seriously
injured anyone, Atlanta police Sgt.
Billy King said police had received
previous complaints about the
animal. '
Also Sunday, Fulton County
Commissioner Michael Hightower {a
said that he intends to introduce at 3.;

‘Wednesday’s commission meeting a
'Zresolution on vicious dogs. He said
the resolution was prompted by a

recent case in DeKalb County in
which a youngster was killed b
three pit bulls. '- -
“In the new ordinance, we need-
to define vicious or dangerous
dogs,” Hightower said. “Secondly,~

'we need to separate pit bulls from

other dogs, if we 'see that pit bulls
are far more dangerous than [Ger-
man] shepherds or dobermans.”
Specifically, Hightower said the
county should: .
I Establish stricter penalties

and fines for owners of pit bulls and
fother vicious dogs that harm others.

I Define confinement of dogs,
since no definition is outlined by the
present ordinance. Hightower said
commissioners should consider
whether pit bulls and other vicious
’dogs need to be kept enclosed by a

f nce. .

and other vicious dogs to carry lia-

bility insurance. ~

spotting watchbirds. Watchbirds stand out

_ among all other birds because their feathers

are always rufﬂed.

Watchbirds have big eyes and big ears, the better
to seek out eVil, and they have. generously proportion-
ed beaks, perfectly suited for squawking. ‘

, Unlike owls, crows, loons, cuckoos and other birds
which don’t give a hoot about rectitude, watchbirds
want things to be neat and orderly, and since things
aren’t that way at all, watchbirds are nervous birds,
constantly hopping to and fro and voicing intermit-
tent cries of distress.

Now that it’s spring and the sap is on the verge of
rising, watchbirds are beginning to peck around in,

, Colorado, looking for causes. Two species that have
been spotted recently are the cloth-covered coat»
catcher and the halo-crested moaning dove.

O 0 O .

The moaning doves are alarmed Over theprospect
of Leadville getting a machine gun factory. Actually
it would only be a machine pistol factory. A machine
pistol is a sort of sub-submachine gun, so actually all
we are talking about here is a little, teensy-weensy
machine gun.

. No matter, say the moaning doves. A machine gun

is a machine gun, and its only purpose is killing peo-
ple. Thus, they say, Leadville should reject this time-
ly employment prospect on moral grounds. The
moaning doves are right when they note that ma-
chine pistols are rarely used to shoot skeet, or even
quail. But dear me, dear doves, Leadville is reeling
through the death throes of Climax Molybdenum and
is in no mood and no position to split hairs on the
morality of machine guns.
. If we wanted to put a point on it as fine as a watch-
bird’s beak, we could mention that for decades Lead.-
, ville has been a major supplier of molybdenum, the A
steelhardening agent that is vital to the manufacture
of gun barrels, breech blocks, bayonets, rifles, pis-
tols, shotguns, cannons, torpedoes, hand grenades
and other weapons without any redeeming social val-
ues. Does that mean Leadville-already has the blood

of mankind on its hands? .

Making machine pistols isn‘t going to turn Lead-
ville into a municipal outcast. Smith & Wesson has
been making shooting irons in Springfield, Mass, for
more than a century, and that city hasn’t suffered
anything at all from it. Nor do people avert their eyes
and cross themselves at the mention of Seattle, just
because Boeing built the 8-52 bombers there.

Leadville could use a nice little factory, and it
' would be foolish for it to turn down the proposed gun

Like the moaning doves, the coatcatchers are hOp-s
ping mad. They’re mad at f urriers and their custom
ers because they don’t think it’s nice to make clothing
out of animal skins. They appear to be talking 'only:
about animal skins with the hair intact, since they
make no mention of suede coats, leather jackets, kid,
gloves or alligator shoes. . ;
They‘ve stuck up a billboard showing a leggy wom- ,
an trailing a bloody fur and captioned, “It takes up td
40 dumb animals to make a fur coat, but only one to
wear it." They say it is wrong to kill an animal only
to satisfy human vanity, and perhaps it is. I don’t
know where they stand on killing animals to eat their}
~ ﬂesh or tan their hides for shoe leather, but I doubt}
that it matters much either way to the dead animal:
Real people, they say, wear fake furs, implying
that real people are smart people. This makes pne‘
wonder why smart people would bother to get an imi»

as I said earlier, who knows which way a watchbird
is likely to hop? \ i 1

If the coatcatchers are going to be thorough in:
their crusade to protect all the animals that people;
kill for one reason or another, they might start by.
working on reprieves for all the geese who perish
supplying the fuzz used to fill down-filled quilts, and
go on to save the rabbits whose pelts provide the soft
skins we wrap our baby buntings in. '

With that accomplished, it should an easy matter
for the coatcatchers to put a stop to the grisly force-
feeding and premature slaughter of those thousands
of luckiess. sloe-eyed little calves who are butchered
on a regular basis to provide the tender, juicy veal -‘
without which it is all but impossible to make really
world-class scallopini. » i

DETROIT FREE PRESS -

Pit bulls: D0 laws

need more bite?

and apprehension your arti-

cle about pit bull dogs and the
large number of dog bite cases
(“Pit bulls become popular,”
March 23). Revulsion at such
callous treatment of the dogs
themselves aside, I am concerned
that these few irresponsible dog
owners will render living in to-
day’s society more difficult for
the many responsible ones. The
immediate reaction to such inci-
' dents usually is to rush into effect
new, overly restrictive, overly
broad legislation that harms
those who have always obeyed
the law and is ignored by the
individuals at whom the laws are
directed. The end result? More
hassles for the law-abiding while
the problem continues unabated.

‘ I read with some frustration

A more reasonable solution is

enforcement of existing laws.
And perhaps, since so many dog
bite victims are children, an an-
swer to the problem is education.
Parents, and maybe schools as
well, should teach young children

respect for — not fear of -- dogs, _

‘and how and when strange or

even familiar dogs should be ap-

proached.

MARTY SIEGRIST
Lansing

Cruel manlpulatlon

I PUBLICLY challenge any of
our legislators who, as a matter of
conscience, will not endorse Sen.
Joe Mack’s proposed bill, the
American pit bull terrier act, a‘
much-needed piece of legislation
regulating the ownership of a
misguided ,and misunderstood

j breed of dog.

The untimely, unsuspected
and unprovoked attacks upon
four people in the past few weeks
in the Detroit area indicate a
definite need for new legislation
and the updating of existing stat-
utes to prevent such attacks. It
will bring to the surface those
owners who breed, train and ma-
nipulate the pit bull for the cruel,
inhumane and heinous crimes
of animal baiting and organized
dog fighting. Let us hold respon-
sible all owners of vicious
dogs.

Why must this magnificent ‘

animal continue to be the contriv-
ance used by owners who perpet-
uate and advocate, in its cruelest
fashion, the sum total of man’s
innate love of violence. '

All plt bulls aren’t mean

I OWN a pit bull, so let me tell
you about my dog. I have 21
nieces and nephews and every
one of them loves Sady. She plays
with anyone who will give her
the attention.

I just can’t get over the articles
that have been in the paper lately;
they make me furious. It seems to
me that these articles are one-

‘ sided, and only tell the readers

about the bad pit bulls. You have
no idea how lovable and loyal a
pit bull can be when raised by the
right person.

Sady has never growled at or
bitten anyone or anything. She
greets everyone who comes over,
wagging her tail and jumping up
to get a pat on the head; she just
wants to be loved. - i

Are pit bulls naturally vicious?

The biggest point that I am

trying to make is this: Please
don’t judge a pit bull itself. It

breaks my heart to hear what
people have done to their dogs to
make them mean. It is not the pit
bull, but the people who raise
them and abuse them.

Especlally dangerous

AFTER READING the March
22 story concerning recent pit
bull attacks in Detroi‘,f (“Man

mauled in pit bull attack”), I
began to think of the seriousness
of the problem. Why people breed
and keep such vicious animals in a
residential area is beyond the
comprehension of many citizens.

These dogs are a danger to.
anyone who is confronted by
them due to the serious injury
that a pit bull can cause. Even
though all dogs are unpredictable .
to some extent, these dogs are
especially dangerous due to the
great deal of power each dog
possesses. '

presecution

By The Associated Press .

BOZEMAN, Mont. — The Feder-
al Endangered Species Act applies
to private land as well as public
land, and people who directly or in-
directly harm threatened spec1es
in extreme cases could be prose-
cuted, a Justice Department attor-g
ney has warned.

Lee Kolker, a trial attorney for
the Justice Department’s division
of wildlife and marine resources,
told the Interagency Grizzly Bear
Study Team recently that working
out problems on the local level IS
the best approach. .

But he said extreme cases m-
volving people who intentionally
feed grizzly bears could result in
prosecutions and civil penalties.

Kolker made the remarks during
the team’s discussion of bear
deaths on private land, especially
around . Yellowstone National
Parkis‘gateway communities.

Conflicts lead to bear deaths

About 99 percent of grizzly .bear
habitat in the Yellowstone region is
public land, but 62 percent of the
bear mortalities result from con-
ﬂicts on 1 percent of private lands.

.The communities of Cooke City,
Gardiner, West Yellowstone and

along the North Fork of the Site ..
shone River have been identified ’

as problem areas.

Study team members said West
Yellowstone should be singled out
for its efforts to reduce bear inel-
dents by embarking on a program
with shear-resistant garbage
dumpsters and ordinances prohib-
iting pe0ple from making food
available to bears, either garbage

 

 

or pet food. .

Steve Mealey, supervisor of the
Shoshone National Forest, said he
visited an inn at Cooke City last
summer and observed garbage be-
ing left in a truck and open dumps-
ter behind the inn. , '

“I sat there and watched two
black bears crawl in the dumpster
and the truck and eat garbage. I
also watched people come from, up—

stairs (at the inn) to watch the ;

bears,” Mealey said.

Darrel Crabb, owner of the All
Seasons Inn, said he never deliber-
ately left garbage out for bears. He
said much of Cooke City’s bear

 

Education program planned

Kolker said there needs to be an
education program in the region to
let people know that the Endanger-
ed Species Act applies on private
land. .

She said it has been documented
that feeding garbage to bears
eventually habituates them to hu-

, mans for food and leads to their de~
mise because of conflicts.
The Endangered Species Act
-’ prohibits anyone from harming, ,
, harassing or taking an endangered Q
i or threatened species. Purposely :
feeding bears could be construed ‘
i as doing them harm and could lead
to prosecution, she said.
‘ She recommended that people
suspected of violating the act be
told they are in violation and asked
to stop the practice. If that doesn’t
work they could be prosecuted un-
der civil statutes and face a fine,
. she said. , .
Chris Serhveen of the bear team
said people who are acting in a
manner which could cause harm to
bears should be informed of the
problem and assured that the fed-
,eral or state agencies would work
to help them.

 

 

 

 




DALLAS TIMES HERALD - April 12, 1987

anadian’s protest of seal hunt;
stops hunters —-— brings tourists

By Jules Loh

 

ASSOCIATED PRESS

GULF OF ST. LAWRENCE,
Canada — The only blood that
stained the ice this year was the
crimson residue of new birth, not
of early death -— the fading evi-
dence of an annual miracle, not an
annual slaughter.

This year the humans who made
their way to Canada’s sealing
grounds came not with clubs and
skinning knives but with cameras.

“The hunt was worth $1 million
a year to the Magdalen Islanders,”
says Brian Davies, sitting on a
hunk of ice, stroking a harp seal
pup.

Davies is the founder and head
of the International Fund for Ani—
mal Welfare. If one person among
the thousands who protested the
hunt over the past 20 years can be
picked as the one who ended it, it
is Davies.

“Preaching animal welfare has a
hollow ring if you’re not also con-
cerned about human welfare,” he
says.

“So what we would like to do is
replace that million with a million
and more in tourist dollars. There
are other ways to make money
from seals than by killing them.
Make them a constituency, like
the swallows of Capistrano. What
you are witnessing here is a colos-
sal spectacle of nature.”

Of the more than 1.5 million
adult harp seals who move down
from the arctic ahead of the freez-
ing ice each year, about 600,000 ar-
rive in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in
March to give birth on a ﬂoating

ice ﬁeld 15 miles wide and four _

miles deep in the vicinity of the
Magdalen Islands.

The number does not count
their snow-white pups, the main
attraction for the sealers of the
past and the tourists of today who
may walk right up and pet one.

But slowly. The pup is only a
few days old, maybe just a few
hours. It will follow your approach
with round, black, trusting eyes,
looking up. The eyes glisten like
wet coal. Kneel, take off your mit-

ten, stroke its back. Try to feel,

when your hand touches its snowy
coat. It is so soft you cannot tell.

Brian Davies’ crusade began in
1965 as a routine investigation for
Canada’s Society for the Preven—
tion of Cruelty to Animals.

Over the years he has been
cursed, jailed, shot at, banned
from the ice by his government
and had his helicopter wrecked.

But the organization he founded

ties-

Demonstrations against the hunt
grew in size and inventiveness ev—
ery year; one group sprayed the
seals with red dye to make the
pelts worthless. _

“All of that aroused the public
c0nscience but it didn’t end the
hunt,” Davies says. “So we
changed our tactics. Instead of put-
ting pressure on the sealers, we
put pressure on the buyers. That
worked.”

The United States in 1971 and
the European Economic Commu-
nity in 1983 banned the importing
of whitecoat pelts. When the mar-
ket collapsed, so did the hunt.

Now IFAW has put up $1 mil—
lion to get the tourist business off
the ground. Davies feels that each

 

year tourism succeeds, there is less.
chance of the hunt being resumed
—— even though the Canadian gov-
ernment has invested four times
that amount, according to a
spokesman, in trying to develop
new markets for the baby harp
pelts, perhaps in the Far East.

“I have absolutely no doubt that

a trip to see the seals is going to ‘

develop into a regular tourist busi—
ness and a big one,” says Eugene
Lewis, a full—time college professor
turned part—time tour leader.

“We had 300 this year. The num-
bers will double next year. Soon
we’ll be putting 2,000 people a
year out here. We’ll have 15 heli-
copters making two flights a day
for three weeks every day the
weather will let us do it.

her parka. “It’s everything I had
. hoped it would be. More than I
expected.”

“The idea of walking among
wild animals well,” she adds,
spreading her mittened hands,
palms upward. “All of my friends
at Turtleback are so envious.”

Anthony, a guide at Turtleback

’_ Zoo in West Orange, N.J., came
. here with her husband, Charles, a
, chemist.

They learned about a chance to

‘ visit the seals through a newspaper

article. Others found out by being
on a mailing list of people con-
cerned aboutanimals.

But the group seemed to ﬁt no
category. They included teachers,

. secretaries, nurses, professional

people, retired people, parents
with children. One elderly gentle-
man observed the seals from a
wheelchair ﬁtted with skis. They

, came from some two-dozen states,
' Australia and England.

They found their separate ways

to nursing homes, where elderly residents

who are often d1sor1ented become more

isolation and loneliness and makes an
otherwise routine day different.

3 neglected horses

By Rob Karwath

Three neglected horses and a ‘

shallow grave containing the re—
mains of several others were found
on land in south Cook County
where a man who recently wrote a
book on thoroughbred racing lives
sheriff’s police said Thursday. ,

Numbers tattooed inside 'two of
the live horses’ lips indicated that
they were at one time racehorses.
Ofﬁc1als of the Illinois Depart-
ment of Agriculture and the Illi-
nors Racmg Board are investigat-
‘mg. '

The land in an uninco ora
area near Steger where thgphortseecsi
were found includes the trailer
home of Frank M. Briggs Sr., 43
said Cook County sheriff’s police
Lt. Ron Jackson. Acting on a tip
sheriffs police said they and ofﬁ:
crals of the Hooved Animal
Humane Society in Barrington
walked onto the property Tuesday
found the grave and later conﬁs:
catleld the three horses.

e orses, two thorou hbr
and a Shetland pony, areg being
cared for by veterinarians, said
Donna Ewing, president of the
Hooved Ammal Humane Society.

.Ewmg called the horses’ condi-
tions “pathe ic.” The two
thoroughbreds, s e said, “were in

‘a severe state of malnutrition.
Eels” thoglves were rotting. They
e s an in '
terrible.” g in ﬁlth. It was Just

The. Shetland pony was covered
with lice, she said, and had poked
its eye, apparently on sharp ob-
Jects stored with it in the semi-
trailer where the animal was
found. Some of the dead horses
also appeared to have been mis-
treated, Ewing said.

When Ewmg and others in her
volunteer group found the two
thoroughbreds in a ramshackle

“barn, the horses’ skin was rottingr

and covered with lice, she said.
Both horses were starving, she
said.

A third thoroughbred in much
better condition was found with
the Shetland pony. But when the
volunteer group returned with
trailers to remove the animals, the
third thoroughbred was gone,
Ewing said. ‘

The society said it sent Briggs a '-
certiﬁed letter Wednesday inform—
ing him that the horses had been
taken and that he has the right to,

 

”a hearing—on" the conﬁscation. Neil
;ther Ewing nor sheriff’s ofﬁcrals
knew if Briggs owned the horses.

Ewing said that Briggs was re—
;sponsible for the horses’ condi-
tions because they were on his
land. ’

Briggs, who could not be
reached for comment, is the au-
thor of “A Glossary of Thorough—
bred Racing,” a guide to racmg
terms and the horse industry, said
Cmdr. Leonard Becicka of the Illi-
nois Department of State Police
division that polices the horse ra-
cing industry. The book was pub- ,
lished this year, Becicka said.

A man who answered .the phone
at Briggs’ home late Thursday said
Briggs did not own the horses and
denied that the living or dead

' horses were mistreated.

“There was no cruelty, believe ;

me,” said the man, who would not ‘
' give his name. “There was some
sickness, and some‘died, but they

j The Mountain Lion Preservation
Foundation, formed last year as a
" fund-raising arm of the effort, has
sent a mailer to 9,000 Californians

V

’ instrumental in persuading Deuk-

mejian to veto the bill that would.
. have continued the hunting ban, .
, . have jumped into the fray with a .

vengeance.

These groups have argued before
the commission that sport hunting
‘ is needed as a tool in game manage-
, ment. Hunters upset over the de-
:. clining numbers of deer have been
a most prominent in the debate.
They argue that lions must be
icontrolled so that deer, the cats'
1 favorite prey, can build up surplus-
es to be “harvested" by hunters.

: Ranchers, who already have the

'right to shoot lions that prey on

remains of the mountain lion in
California.” Another 20,000 fund-
raising letters went out last week.
The foundation's literature often
compares the lion's plight to that of

, the grizzly bear, which was hunted

to extinction in California.
Lacking evidence that the lion is

. endangered, opponents of the hunt

have attempted to discredit the
conclusion of state biologists that
the lion population is stable and

, unthreatened-

At the Fish and Game Commis-

their livestock, have also argued ;

strongly for the hunting season.

However, only about 25% of the ,
210 hunters who would be issued 7
~ permits under the department pro- ;
posal would be expected to be é
successful, and many sportsmen
acknowledge that taking perhaps
50 lions out of a population that f

they believe exceeds 5,000 would

have little effect on deer or live- '

stock. ,
Similarly, the state’s biologists
have said that they expect the lion

population to quickly replenish it- _
self through natural means. A lion ..

 

sion’s March meeting, for example,
Sharon Negri, president of the
foundation, told the panel that a
survey of mountain lion experts
casts doubt on the methods the
state used to count the lions, and
N egri suggested that the lions'
secretive nature makes it impossi-
ble to accurately estimate their
numbers. But results of N egri’s
survey showed that only two of 15
biologists who responded to the
group’s questionnaire agreed with
the foundation's contention.

“The key is that the governor
and the commission have to look at
public opinion," Negri said. .
“There’s too much opposition to ,
open a trophy-hunting season at
this time. Much more needs to be
known before they can think sf
making a big management decision
on the mountain lion."

The pro-hunting lobby has re-
sponded in kind. The California
Sportsman’s Lobby, the California
Rifle and Pistol Assn. and the
National Riﬂe Assn., which were

(I

habitat can support a given number
f of cats, they say. If the lions are not
hunted, the cats limit themselves
naturally. If lions are removed, the
population returns to whatever
. level the environment can sustain.
“This has nothing to do with
game management," said Bud
Hemman, a spokesman for several
Central Valley hunting groups that
favor a much more liberal hunting
season with as many as 1,000

permits. .“Taking that many lions ‘

will do nothing to benefit the rest of
our wildlife. It will not bring preda-
tors and prey back into bal-
ance. . . . It is pure and simple a
trophy hunt."

Still, the hunting lobby sees
opposition to the department pro-
posal as a threat to hunters' rights,

. and the hunting community’s lead-

ers have portrayed the confronta-
tion in those terms.

David Marshall, the NRA’s-‘Sac-
ramento lobbyist, said he grew

frustrated trying to negotiate with
the environmentalists and decided
to show them “who has the clout in

this state." The NRA recently sent .

letters to about 10% of its 300,000
California members to seek their
help on the mountain lion issue.
“Your gun and hunting rights are
directly on the line in California!"
the letter said. “The NRA and the
California Rifle and Pistol Assn.
have pledged not to give another
inch to the opponents of gun own-
ership and sports hunting who are

relying on emotional appeals to the
public to accomplish their goals." « ‘
DeChambeau of the Rifle and
Pistol Assn. said his group had no
choice but to respond to the peti-
tion and letter campaign waged by
opponents of the hunt. Though the '
commission's mail so far has run 8

‘ to l in opposition to the hunting

season, DeChambeau and the
NRA’s lobbyist predicted that the
commission would be flooded with
letters and petitions from hunters
this week.

sents the California Riﬂe and Pistol

Assn., an arm of the National Rifle ;

Assn., agreed: “As far as I'm con- ;

Indeed, the debate over whether
the California Fish and Game Com-
mission should lift a 15- year ban on
hunting the big cats has focused-
more on hunters’ rights than on
game management or wildlife biol-
ogy. Friday is the commission’s day

draws near the battle has become
increasingly emotional, the cam-
paign more intense.

At issue is whether the commis-
sion should approve the Depart-
ment of Fish and Game's proposal
for a 79-day hunting season, during

, which as many as 210 lions could be i

killed. The hunt would be the first i

' since the Legislature imposed a;

moratorium on hunting the lions in

Advocates of protecting, the

knowledge that the animal, which

2 is hunted in every Western state
‘ except California, is not an endan-
; gered species. And they have pres-
: ented no evidence to suggest that

the proposed issuance of 210 hunt-
ing permits would adversely affect
the lion population in the state.

At the same time, hunters and

biologists concede that the pro;

posed season would do little or

nothing to decrease the number of
deer and livestock killed by li-
ons—-long a stated concern of
sportsmen and ranchers. They also
acknowledge that there is no rea-
son to believe that hunting will

. reduce contacts between lions and

people, such as the two maulings of
Orange County children in the last
year.

But none of that has prevented
either side from launching an all-
out offensive on the issue, complete

with mailers, petition drives, celeb-

rity testimonials and all the vitriol
of a political campaign.

Some proponents. of the depart-
ment's plan have said that anyone
who argues against lion hunting
should be prepared to assume re-
sponsibility for any additional
maulings that occur in California.

So hard fought has the battle
- become that at least one opponent

of the proposal warned hunters at a
: recent hearing that those who
- venture into the wilds to shoot lions

could become targets themselves.
Sportsmen, in turn, have asked the
commission to approve regulations
prohibiting hunter harassment.
Lobbyist Yeates concedes that
the governor’s veto put the burden
on the preservationists to show
why the lions, also known as
cougars, should not be hunted. Of

the 13 other game mammals under
the commission's jurisdiction, only
the Nelson bighorn sheep is not
nowthunted, and the commission
last month tentatively approved a
season for that species. .

“The argument you get from the
commission or the staff is: ‘Look,
the lion is a game mammal, and we
have a policy that encourages sport
hunting. Therefore, we’re mandat-
ed to hunt this animal,’ " Yeates
said. “The burden is on us to
overcome that assumption."

. To do so, mountain lion advo-
cates have launched a campaign
aimed at generating enough public

opinion to sway the commission

against the hunt. They have hired a
public relations firm to lobby
newspapers for their editorial sup-
port, and actor Robert Redford has

INT. HERALD TRIBUNE - 4/17/87

U.S., EC Urged to Ban

Kangaroo Skin {imparts

By Michael Richardson
International Herald Tribune ' '

SYDNEY — Animal welfare
groups, embroiled in a dispute with
the Australian government over
large-scale killing of kangaroos, are
trying to control the practice by
urging European countries and the
United States to ban imports of
kangaroo skins. '

The government last month au-
thorized commercial hunters in
four of Australia’s six states to kill
2.8 million kangaroos in 1987 as
part of an annual population con-
trol program.

Farmers and other proponents
of the hunt note that kangaroos
breed in large numbers and com-
pete for food with sheep and cattle.

However, animal welfare groups
say that the management program
is so poorly supervised that mil-
lions of kangaroos are slaughtered
illegally each year, threatening
some species with extinction.

The killing is symbolized for
many Australians by a scene in
“Crocodile Dundee,” the popular
movie written and performed by
the Australian actor Paul Hogan, in
which inebriated hunters range
through the outback in Land-
Rovers, rounding up and shooting
kangaroos in a binge of nocturnal
carnage.

Richard Jones, the founder of
the Fund for Animals, said, “It’s an
international disgrace and its about
time it was exposed.”

Australians for Animals, said they _

recently made an important ad-
vance by persuading eight multina-
tional companies to stop the sale in
Britain of athletic shoes made of
kangaroo leather.

According to spokesmen in Lon-
don for some of the companies, the

agreement apparently will be.

ton, said it had agreed not to manu-

facture new models of soccer shoes.

Adidas KG, based near Nurem-
burg, said it had agreed in principle
to stop production of all kangaroo
leather shoes. A spokesman, Klaus
Mueller, said that Adidas sells only

one model of soccer shoe that uses .

kangaroo leather.

Company policy, he said, is to
continue using kangaroo hide, al-
beit in sharply reduced quantities,
until an acceptable synthetic re-
placement is found.

Officials in London for Nike, an .

Oregon-based company, said,
“Nothing we have ever sold has
used kangaroo hide.”

Australian officials said that the
Companies had succumbed to
blackmail.

Greenpeace threatened to post
billboard posters in Britain depict-
ing an athlete running on kanga-
roo-skin shoes dripping with blood.

Greenpeace said the posters. car-
rying the caption, “Who‘d want to
be in their shoes?” would have

named the companies had they not
agreed to stop using kangaroo
leather. ,

In London, Lorraine Thorne, a
Greenpeace spokeswoman, said,
“We will not stop until every Euro-
pean consumer is aware of and ab-
hors the use of kangaroo skin, not
only in sports shoes but also in
walking shoes, belts, wallets,
gloves, handbags and other leather
products.”

Trevor Daly, a spokesman for
Greenpeace’s office in Sydney, said
the campaign would be extended to
West Germany this year and then
to Italy, the main importer of kan-
garoo hides.

Mr. Jones said that a bill to ban
the import of kangaroo products to
the United States is due to be con-
sidered by the fish and wildlife sub-
committee of a US. House com-
mittee this month. _

The European Parliament’s com-
mittee on environmental protec-
tion is considering a partial ban.

social justice—~women’s
rights, civil rights—goes
through three stages,” says;
United States animal—rights guru
Tom Regan. “Ridicule, discussion,
adoption. Although in some
quarters people are still ridiculing
‘us, we’ve moved beyond that. We
have all the indications of being at
very high—power discussion.”
Professor, philosopher, author of
a Pulitzer Prize—nominated book, ‘
“The Case for Animal Rights,”
Regan has long been considered
the animal rights movement’s most
articulate voice of moderation.
He’s “the foremost philosopher on‘
animal rights in the country,”
according to Dr. Michael Fox,

Society of the US. and president
‘of the lntemational Network for
Religion and Animals in ‘
Washington, DC. Regan’s “tweed”
suit [no animal ﬁber, of course],
gentle voice and reasoned
argument have provided a welcome
counterimage to that of the sign-
wielding zealot perched angrily
outside a medical research lab
while chanting. against vivisection.
After worldwide lecture tours [he
has addressed the United Nations
and the United States Congress],
14 books and numerous honors
and awards, Regan is out to
awaken the American consumer to
animal rights—one purchase at a
time. So after an erudite
conversation on the philosophical

“We are a consumer society,”
says Regan, “and our buying '

doing things. The only trouble is,
most people don’t know what
they’re voting for and against when
they reach for something on the.
supermarket shelves.”

were uncrated, moved into their

. homes behind the exhibit and treated

to a snack of apples.
Panda Population Declines

Three Beijing zoo officials, who will'
remain here during the visit, accom-
panied them on the plane and on their
trip to the zoo. Also here at the
Mayor’ s invitation is Dr. Li Yangwen,
director of the Beijing Zoological

Gardens, which is breeding giant pan-

das 1n captivity.

The most recent census of wild pan-
das, which live near the Chinese-Ti-
betan border, counted only 700 of~ the
animals, down from 1,000 a few years
ago. Their numbers are decreasing
due to continual shrinking of their
natural habitat, the bamboo forests.

Dr. Li wore a tie festooned with
panda heads. “We are trying so hard

.to save them,” he said, “to conserve

areas of forest. ” His zoo has
produced 22 babies, of which 15 have
survived.

Since 1980, the New York Zoologi-

cal Society has sent experts to aid the

Chinese in their conservation efforts.

Dr. William G. Conway, the society’s,

general director and head of the

.Bronx Zoo, designed a captive breed-;
ing center for the animals. Giant pan-A

das are not passionate and have a low
reproduction rate.

A Somber Message

“They carry such an aura of excite-
ment,” said Dr. Conway. "They’re in-
credibly roly—poly. A panda can sleep

cradling its head with its hindlegs.”

The animals are dexterous, using
their sixth “finger," an articulated
member protruding from the wrist
joint, to hold bamboo daintily.

For all their lovable, engaging qual-
ities, the giant pandas also bring a
more somber message: They are ex-
tremely endangered. “The only hope

:is for the Chinese to prOtect them, to
develop bamboo corridors between
'panda populations,” Dr. Conway said.
J‘And they are creating more re-
sources. I don’t see us trying to save ‘
the grizzly bear the way they're ,

trying to save the pandas.”

The Chinese charge a fee for the .

giant pandas’ visit, but Dr. Conway

' would not reveal the amount. Net pro- 4
ceeds from tickets to the panda moat, .;
at $1 for adults and 50 cents for chil- .3
dren, will go to the Chinese govem-

«ment for panda conservatwn .

 

Tickets are available at the zoo.
The giant pandas can be seen during
zoo hours, 10 A. M. to 5 P. M. Monday

through Saturday and to 5: 30 P. M. on

Sundays and holidays.

City ponders putting teeth I
in vicious-dog ordinance ’

By Dave Daley
and Tim Miller
STAFF WRITERS

While State Sen. Neal Zimmers’ was

' calling in Columbus for “immediate

Senate action” on his bill about pit bull-
dogs, Ronald Winchekgmarched to Day-
ton’s City Hall to complain about an
attack that left his 6-year-old grand-
daughter needing a thousand stitches in
her head— an attack not by a pit bull,
but a German shepherd.

“It has nothing to do with pit bulls,
all right?” Winchek said as the Dayton
City Commission debated ways to limit
dog attacks in the city, including a pos-
sible ban on pit bull-type dogs.

“Whether it’s a pit bull, a German
shepherd, it doesn’t make any differ-
ence,” Winchek told commissioners
Wednesday in urging a ban on any dog
that causes injuries.

Under the city’s existing vicious-dog

_ ordinance, dogs that attack or injure

either peeple or other animals are
prohibited. .

The incident only underscored a
point made earlier by Commissioner
Tony Capizzi, who is refusing to sup-
port a total ban on pit bulls in Dayton in

' the wake of an attack Monday that left

a retired Kettering doctor dead.

“I haven’t been convinced by anyone
an attack by a pit bull is any different
than an attack by a German shepher ,”
he said before Wednesday’s meeting.

Commissioners asked for recommen-

dations on how to strengthen the city’s
vicious-dog ordinance, but stOpped
short of supporting Commissioner
Abner Orick’s call for a total ban on pit
bulls.

“I say ban ’em, period," Orick told
his colleagues. “These pit bulls are sim-
ply vicious dogs. They are a danger to
the health, welfare and safety of the
citizens of Dayton.”

One supporter, Commissioner Mark
Henry, said city residents are not al-
lowed to keep “lions or ocelots.”

Mayor Richard Clay Dixon said the
city’s law department has cautioned an
ordinance banning one breed of dog
might be overturned by the courts.

“We need to deal with all vicious ani-
mals within the city,” Dixon said. “Our
ordinance, as it exists, is one that is
substantial. . . . We need to enforce
what we have on the books.”

In Columbus, state Sen. M. Ben
Gaeth, R-Defiance, chairman of the
Senate Agriculture, Commerce and La-
bor Committee said, “I’ve told Sen.
Zimmers I don’t believe you can single
out one animal as he is trying to do.”

Zimmers’ bill would permit county
commissioners to control, restrict or
prohibit ownership of pit bulls in unin-
corporated areas.

However, Gaeth said he is “more in
favor” of a bill sponsored by state Rep.
Robert Hickey, D-Dayton,‘ that tightens

cious dogs, but does not single out any

i Ownership key to pit bull case

Investigators still piecing together facts in attack on Kettering man

By Edwina Blackwell
.- and Jim Dillon
STAFF WRlTERS

As the Montgomery County coro-
ner’s office determines whether to rule
’ the dog-attack death of Dr. William G.
Eckman as accidental or a homicide,
prosecutors say ownership of the ani-
mals is a key issue in the consideration
for filing charges.

“At this point, we don’t really know
what the facts are, so we don’t know
what to base the charge on,” Montgom-
' ery County Prosecutor Lee Falke said.

Jean Zimmers, director of the Mont-
gomery County Animal Shelter, said
shelter records show Wilbur Rutledge
owns one of the pit bull terriers in-
volved in the fatal attack of Eckman
and both dogs were registered to Rut-
ledge last year.

 

I COMMISSION DEBATE/9
I CINCY LAW UNWiELDY/9

 

Zimmers said the second dog now is
registered to a woman she only de-
scribed as Rutledge’s “housemate.”

She declined to say if the housemate
was Joetta Darmstadter, but police
have said Darmstadter is a resident of
256 Marathon Ave., the address where
the dogs were kept. \

The two pit bulls mauled Eckman,
67, Mbnday afternoon in front of 256
Marathon Ave. and also attacked
Darmstadter. Eckman later died at
Good Samaritan Hospital and Health
Center after suffering cardiac arrest.
Darmstadter remains in fair condition
at the hospital.

“I don’t think the decision is ours,”

Zimmers said. “It will be up to the
courts.”

Investigators still are piecing togetho
er the events that led to the dog attack
Monday afternoon and police have re-
leased few details on what may have
happened.

Police have said they believe Darm-
stadter was attacked in the home. But
they are not saying if Eckman, who
ambulance crews found on the street,
was ever in the house.

The city ordinance on vicious dogs
applies to dog attacks off the owner’s
property. A person who violates the or-
dinance can be found guilty of a first-
degree misdemeanor, which carries a
maximum penalty of six months in jail
and a $1,000 fine. . ,

Since investigators are not sure if the

dogs started attacking Eckman at the
Marathon address, “the ordinance isn’t
the help we thought it would be,” Falke
sai

d. .5.

The attack has heightened the pub-
lic’s fear of pit bulls and is making life
hard for other pit bull owners.

In Greene County, a pit bull owner
agreed to remove his dog from the
county after being cited for letting the
dog run loose.

In Montgomery County, a planned
weekend pit bull terrier show that was
to attract 200 dogs from four states had
to be canceled when the club that orga-
nized the show could not get insurance.

John Tatman of Farmersville, a
member of the Miami Valley American
Pit Bull Terrier Club, said the planned
obedience show was to be held at Rich-
ardson Stables on Jackson Road in But-
ler TWp. - .

The show was called off when an
insurance carrier for the stables “called
and said absolutely not,” Tatman said.

The stables were “going to add us to
their insurance for the two-day show,
but now they won’t carry us,” Tatman

said.

“They said they just can’t take a
chance on us. We checked across the
country and found nobody can obtain
insurance.

“Only in the last two or three years
have clubs even bothered about insur-
ance, and I don’t believe there has ever
been an incident of anybody getting bit
at one of the shows.”

Xenia resident William Archer de-
scribes his companion, Bullet, a V2-year-
old male pit bull terrier, as “playful as a
poodle,” but Xenia police and local
neighborhood residents believe the bar-
rel-chested, muscular dog is capable of
creating havoc. .

As a result, Archer, 30, said he will
give up the dog he has owned for more
than a year. because he said he simply
can’t afford “any more hassles.

“I’m not afraid he’s going to bite
someone. But I don’t want any more
problems with the police and the peo-
ple in the neighborhood.”

Wednesday morning, Xenia police
cited Archer for letting Bullet run
loose. ,

The dog, according to a complaint
filed by one neighbor, had broken his

 

 

chain and had chased a boy riding his .
skateboard in front of Archer’s East .
Second Street home early Tuesday
evening.

Xenia police Lt. Claude Lyons said,
“During the past six weeks, we have
had three or four complaints about that
dog running loose.” .

Lyons said the dog never actually

‘ tried to bite any children or pedestri-

ans.

“But with what happened in Dayton,
people are frightened by these dogs,”
Lyons said. “They get real scared when
they see one running down their neigh-
borhood street. .

“We try to be fair and give everyone
a break. But there comes a point when
we have to do something to protect the
public.” .

Archer said neighborhood children

are guilty of teasing and goading Bullet
into chasing them. He said Bullet sim-
ply would slip out of his collar and run
after the children to play with them,
much like any other dog would.
Yet Archer said he knew he ebuld not
fight public opinion when he appeared
before Xenia Municipal Judge Ray-
mond Hieber on Wednesday morning.

a he is docile, gentle and obedient. But

prohibiting ownership of the breed in-
side the city, but Cincinnati police say
the law can't be enforced.

The ordinance, passed May 21, pro-
vides “no person shall own, keep, or
harbor a pit bull terrier” within the
municipal limits of Cincinnati. It fur-
ther provides anyone who violates the
ordinance is subject to a maximum fine
of $1,000 and up to '60 days in jail.

A second ordinance prohibits the sale
of pit bull terriers with the same
penalties.

The ordinances define pit bull terri-
ers as, “Staffordshire bull terrier or
American Staffordshire terrier breed of
dog, or any mixed breed of dog which
contains as an element of its breeding
the breed of Staffordshire bull terrier
or American Staffordshire terrier. . . .”

But pit bulls terriers don’t have stan-
dard characteristics - they vary in col-
or, features and siZe.

“Without breeding papers on blood
lines, we can’t say unequivocally a dog

is a pit bull, isn’t a pit bull or is part -

pit bull,” said Capt. Dale Menkhaus of
the Cincinnati Police Department.
“Veterinarians tell me if you breed a
pit bull and a German shepherd, you
might get something that looks like a
German Shepherd but actually is part
pit, ” Menkhaus said. “They tell me you
can breed a schnauzer and a terrier and

get something with pit bull

characteristics.”

Cincinnati Councilman David Mann,
who authored the ordinance, said he
doesn’t understand what the proof
problem is all about. ‘

“Judges and juries reach conclusions
all the time as to what something is or

isn’t,” Mann said. “I know what a collie '

is because I know what a collie is. I
may have a hard time articulating the
differences between a collie and other
breeds, but I know one when I see
one.”

Mann, who is an attorney, said one
good method of identification would be
neighbors or acquaintances of the dog
owner who could testify on occasion

the owner had said, possibly bragged, -

the dog was a pit bull.

 

 

The ordinance originally provided

' identification as a pit bull terrier be;
. made by a qualified veterinarian. The _‘
. ordinance has since been amended to '

remove this provision.
Only one person has been charged

‘ under the ordinance and charges were
g eventually dropped because of the pro:

vision for veteri narian identification.
Michael Gaskins, 30, was charged in
September 1986 after neighbors said
his female pit bull terrorized their
neighborhood. Although the dog was

"usually restrained, it often ”got lose

and chased people,” neighbors said.

Charges against 'Gaskins didn't hold
up because the local association of vet-
erinarians refused to send anyone to
make the identification, Mann said.

“The vets wouldn’t testify because
they didn’t want to anger dog owners.
After all, they make their living from
dog owners,” he said.

The amended ordinance has not yet
been put to the test.

Cincinnati also has a “vicious dog”
ordinance under which owners of any

dogs —- regardless of breed — who at-_’
tack people or other animals can be '

prosecuted. ,

Mann said the ordinances specifical-
ly against pit bulls were necessary be-
cause the vicious characteristics of the
dogs made them unsuitable for crowd-
ed urban areas.

The council took into consideration
an unsolicited letter signed by six phy-
sicians at Children’s Hospital Medical
Center in Cincinnati, Mann said.

The letter, dated May 7, 1986, urged

the council to pass the ordinance.

“We have all witnessed the tragic
consequences of attacks on children by
these animals. These attacks have re-
sulted in fatalities and disfigurement in
too many children already. We feel

Two Dayton lawmakers sponsoring
dog control bills say the Monday death
of a Kettering man after a dog attack
may speed their efforts. '

“It’s a terrible tragedy, but unfortu-
nately it sometimes takes something
like this to bring about a change in the
law.” said State Rep. Robert Hickey, D-
Dayton. ~

Also Tuesday, Dayton City Commis-
sioner Abner Orick called for an out-

right city ban of pit bulls and other

dogs considered vicious.

Sparked by a ms

To those who

be prohibited by breed, Orick said:
“You’re allowed to have snakes in the

-. city, but you’re not allowed to have poi-
. sonous snakes, all right?”

Hickey’s bill —- which would regu-
late all dangerous and vicious dogs re-
gardless of breed -— had its first hear-
ing Tuesday before the HOuse Civil and
Commercial Law Committee.

State Sen. Neal F. Zimmers, D-Day-
ton, said the death Monday of Dr. Wil-
liam Eckman was “shocking. It should
demonstrate to everyone in the legisla-
ture just how serious this problem is.”

A bill sponsored by Zimmers singles
out pit bull dogs, the kind that attacked
Eckman, for tighter regulation.

As introduced, Zimmers’ bill would
allow county commissioners to regu-
late the ownership, control and use of
pit bull dogs in unincorporated areas of
a county. Cities and other incorporated
areas currently can enact dog-control
laws. .

Tuesday, however, Zimmers said he
is considering asking the Senate Agri-
culture, Commerce and Labor Commit-
tee, which has held one hearing on the
bill, to toughen the legislation.

“I’m not so sure in the aftermath of
this attack that we shouldn’t restrict
ownership of pit bulls and address the
issue statewide,” Zimmers said. “The
pit bulls are clearly a breed apart. They
are vicious and they are dangerous.”

Attack may, aid 2 bills; I
Orickcalls for city ban ‘. “

Zimmers noted that the Humane So~

ciety and other animal rights groups

1 are opposed to singling out a species for

tight regulation. “I understand their
concern but I can’t agree with their
reasoning. We’re not talking about
your average pet,” he said.

The Hickey bill would require that
“dangerous” and “vicious” dogs be
confined to a locked pen, fenced yard or
other locked enclosure or be on a leash
or tether not more than six feet long.

A dog would be considered danger-

ous if it attempted to bite, attack or

endanger any person or animal without
provocation while off the premises of
its owner. A dog would be labeled vi-
cious if it killed or caused injury to
someone or another animal while off
the owner’s premises.

Under certain conditions, the bill al-
lows vicious dogs to be killed. Owners
who do not properly register the ani-
mals with local officials or who do not
properly confine the dogs could be
found guilty of a misdemeanor.

Hickey said he did not make his bill, . ;;.-_;'.: '»

One of the pit bulls that attacked Dr. William Eckman

f can apparently be trained to be a lov-
able pet.”

“The intent is to place more liability
upon the owners,” said Hickey. “The
Humane Society agrees that it’s time to
stop looking just at the animals and
consider the liability of the owners.”

Hickey said many cities, such as
Dayton, have enacted dog control laws,
but said many owners simply move
outside the city limits. “The bill would
also allow cities that want to to in-
crease their penalties up to the pro-
posed state level,” he said.

Hickey admitted his bill probably

' would not have prevented the attack

upon Eckman.

“We may not be able to legislate
away all such attacks but the goal
should be to reduce the chance of such
attacks taking place,” he said.

He said the Humane Society said 15
Ohioans died last year following dog
attacks.

Orick’s call for a pit bull ban, likely
to be discussed at today’s city commis-
sion meeting, is getting a mixed reac
tion from his commission colleagues.

“We came close to banning pit bulls
in 1984 —- and at that point we hadn’t

had a case where a person had been
killed by one,” said Commissioner
Mark Henry. “That in itself is reason
enough to consider again whether these
dogs should even be allowed in a city
neighborhood.”

Mayor Richard Clay Dixon said the
city's attorneys cautioned in 1984
about the legality of banning one spe»
cies of dog. “I agree with the senti-
meat, but whether an entire breed of
dog can be banned, I don't know,” Dix-
on added. “I agree with Commissioner
Orick'that something should be done
with the pit bull breed.”

However, Commissioner Tony Ca-
pizzi, the only lawyer on the commis-
sion, said Tuesday that owners at pit
bulls are sure to challenge in court any
attempt by the city to prohibit pit bull
dogs in the city. '

The city of Cincinnati in May 1986
adopted an ordinance banning pit bulls, '
but revised the legislation several
months ago ~-—- after the city was sued
by pit bull owners —- to better with-
stand legal challenges, according to
Cincinnati City Prosecutor Terrence“
Cosgrove;

the first call came in at 12:58 p.m., and
it took police about six minutes to
arrive.

Fire Chief Glenn Alexander praised
the emergency crews and said they
handled the situation as quickly as
possible.

“From the time we picked up the"
telephone when the first lady called to
report it to the time the paramedic
crew reported that they were removing
the woman from the scene, 13 minutes
and 22 seconds passed,” Alexander
said. “We don’t get any better than
that.”

Alexander said the first call came at
12:56 p.m., apparently from
Darmstadter.

The fire chief said the caller was
nearly hysterical and “was yelling
something about bull bites, and blood
being all over.

Alexander said a recording of the call
showed the dispatcher was able to de-
termine the woman had been bitten by
a dog, but the woman did not tell the
dispatcher that a dog attack was
continuing.

Police Lt. Col. James Newby said po-
lice records show the fire department
contacted police about the incident at
12:56 pm.

But he said the first police crew to be
notified did not treat the call as an
emergency because no one had yet re-
ported that the attack was continuing.

Alexander said the ambulance ar-
rived two minutes and 12 seconds after.
being dispatched and called for
assistance.

The crew did not get out of its vehi- .
cle, however.

“They are trained that until a scene
is under control, they are not to become
victims of the incident,” Alexander
said. “It’s the same as if they had found
a man with a loaded gun at the scene.
They’re not armed; they’re not trained
to handle things like that. They are sup—
posed to notify the police."

Newby said the police dispatcher
heard the ambulance crew say a man
still was being attacked. and the dis-
patcher told the police crew to switch
to emergency status.

Newby said the first police officers
arrived at 1:02 pm.

By that time, Rutledge had arrvied
and called off the dogs, and ambulance
crews were tending to the two victims.

The trauma of the death lingered
Tuesday.

From his downstairs Marathon Ave-
nue apartment, 87-year-old Clarence
Baker shuddered as he recalled watch-
ing the attack as he sat helplessly in his
wheelchair.

Baker said it was the worst thing he
had ever seen.

“That man was as red as could be.
You couldn’t have painted him any red-
der,” Baker said. ‘

0f the few people who attempted to
drive off the dogs, Stephen Sims, 28, of

60 Patton Ave., had the best success.

Sims was visiting his girl friend on
Marathon Avenue when he heard the
noise and screaming. He grabbed a cur-
tain rod, ran outside and began pum-
meling and jabbing the dogs.

“I couldn’t find anything else," Sims
said. “I knew I couldn’t hurt them very
much. I just knew I had to help.”

Sims said one dog ran off after he hit
it several times, but the other, larger
dog began to chase him as he fended it
off with the bent curtain rod. ,

“I beat the pole until it couldn’t do
any good,” Sims said. “Then a man
pulled up and called the dog to him.”

Witnesses to Monday’s attack that

two dogs were kept at 256 Marathon

Jones, who was bitten by a pit bull

Eckman lying in the street as two dogs
tore violently at his arms and legs.
Jones said she ran out and began urging
others to try to drive off the dogs.

“I consider any dog with teeth to be
vicious,” she said. “I really don’t think
people should be able to keep dogs like
that. ”

She looked at Anthony, who played

dog.

“Every time I look out my window, I
see that man screaming and that dog
chewing him.”

Dayton police Tuesday said it still is
unclear exactly how or where the at-
tack started.

The Montgomery County coroner’s
office said Eckman, of 2543 S. Dixie
Drive, suffered a heart attack as he was
being mauled by the dogs.

Coroner’s Investigator J.R. Williams
said Eckman was taken to Good Samar-

. itan Hospital and Health Center in com-

plete cardiac arrest and died during
surgery two hours later.

Williams said Eckman had severe
dog bites to both legs and his right arm.
A ruling on the cause of death was de-
ferred Monday.

Joetta Darmstadter, 32, who lives at
256 Marathon Ave., also was attacked
and was listed in satisfactory condition
Tuesday night.

Dayton Police Maj. Edward Long
said the police investigation indicated
she was attacked inside the house by
one of the dogs.

He said the probe had not established
that Eckman was in the house.

Long also said investigators are con-
sidering charges under city ordinances
for harboring a vicious dog and for ani-

mal control.

While Long said ownership of the
dags involved has not been established,
Montgomery County animal wardens
saidMonday that one of the dogs was
owned by Wilbur Rutledge, who re-
portedly lives at the Marathon Avenue
address.

LNeither Rutledge, who was able to
stop the attack when he arrived on the
scenefMonday, nor Darmstatder could
be reached for comment Tuesday.

‘Initial reports that the attack lasted
25 minutes, however, were disputed
Tuesday both by authorities and wit-
nesses,who now say it lastedbetween
10 and 15 minutes.

dogs are ideal employees, forever

But an employer whom a cat

Lots of other research 1
goes on at Isle Royale

Isle Royale is known worldwide for
the wolf -moose studies that have been
going on for nearly 30 years.

While those studies may be the best
known, they’re only one facet of the
park’s research, said Bob Krumenaker,
resource management specialist at Isle
Royale National Park.

0 There‘s the moose-beaver project,
for example. A University of Minneso-
ta researcher is studying how the diets
of moose and beaver affect the recy-
cling of nutrients through the soil.
Moose tend to eat nutritious balsam fir,
paving the way for nutrient-poor
spruce to take over. Beaver eat old
aspen, making room for young aspen to
grow. The young aspen are higher in _ !
nutrients, so beavers are improving ’ In early July, Isle Royale will be-~

0 Isle Royale is one of five national
parks in a 10-year acid rain study.
“We’ve learned a lot, but the study isn’t
designed to say, ‘These are the impacts
of acid rain: A, B and C,’ ” Krumenaker
said. The point is to understand the

seem like fast-food heaven for the
wolves. Yet Peterson believes the
wolves numbers are declining because
they can’t find "enough to eat.
“That’s hard for people to under-
stand when there are six or seven
moose per square mile . . . but it points
out the importance of moose vulner-
ability,” Peterson said. It’s hard for
wolves to catch and kill healthy moose.

’ WOLF WARS also have taken atoll.
At the beginning of this winter’s sur-
vey, three wolf packs lived on the
island: the West Pack, the East Pack
and the Harvey Lake Pack, which held
the territory between the other two.

; During one of Peterson’s flights, he
saw a territorial confrontation that
tipped the balance.

. “We saw the Harvey Lake Pack
bedded down around a moose they had
killed in the East Pack’s territory,” said
P‘eterson.“A few miles away we saw
the East Pack coming through the
forest. They had picked up the trail of
the Harvey Lake group and were head-
ed toward the kill site.

' “The East Pack came over a ridge,
saw the Harvey Lake wolves and made
straight for the dominant male of the
Harvey Lake group. Unfortunately the
Harvey Lake male had just eaten and
couldn’t move quickly enough to get
away with the other members of his

pack. He put up a furious fight . . . but
after 25 minutes the attackers succeed-
ed in killing him,” said Peterson.

The battle was the final blow for the
Harvey Lake Pack, which always had
been “on the short end of the stick . . .
attacked by packs on each side,” Peter-
son said. After the battle, the two
surviving members of the Harvey Lake
Pack split up and the East and West
packs divided the island equally be-
tween them.

PETERSON HAS BEEN studying
the Isle Royale moose and wolves since
1970, when he began graduate work
with wildlife biologist Durward Allen.
Since 1975, Peterson, 38, has directed
the research program, but he still relies
on many of the techniques Allen used
when he started the program in 1958.

With pilot Don Glaser, Peterson
spends about 50 days of every winter
cruising 800 feet above the island in a
two-seat airplane. In their surveys,
Peterson and Glaser follow wolves and
their tracks to find out where the packs
have gone and how many moose
they’ve killed. In the past 16 years,
Peterson’s air surveys have followed
the wolves for about 7,000 miles; 316
moose kills have been studied.

In summer, Peterson’s students hike
around the island “as often as they can
stand it,” he said. “Mosquitoes, black-
fiies, swamps, mud, heat, rain, all that
sort of thing” make the going rugged.

 

 

 

The students look for moose carcasses
and gauge the number of wolves by
listening to their howls.

Peterson and his students examine
remains of every dead moose they find

. —'- whether it was killed by wolves or

died of malnutrition or an accident.
Teeth and bones are clues to the
moose’s age and nutritional condition.
When the teeth are cut in cross-section
and polished, annual growth lines can
be counted like tree rings, Peterson
said. Bones show signs of arthritis, and
the fat content of bone marrow indi-
cates how well-nourished the animal
was.

Information from the 1,800 moose
examined since the project began has
been put into a computer data bank,
and the results reveal secrets of the
animals’ population swings.

One surprising conclusion, Peterson
said, is that “the lifelong survival pat-
tern hinges on early nutritional
levels. If moose are well-nourished
before and just after being born, they

show rapid growth and excellent sur-
vival. If they’re poorly nourished early
in life, survival is cut almost in half, and
they’re also killed by wolves in much
greater numbers as young adults.”
Even the tendency to get arthritis later
in life is related to early nutrition, he
said.

PETERSON PREDICTS the Isle
Royale moose will reach a peak of
about 2,000 sometime during the next
decade, when they will begin to deplete
their food supplies.

As for the wolves, they could stay at
about 15 to 20 for the next few years,
then gradually increase in numbers as
the island's moose become older and '.
weaker. But because there are only two
breeding females left, 'the wolves’ fu-
ture is uncertain. .

‘ “There’s no way they should last,
but we can’t predict how long they will '
last before problems show up. It
might be centuries or it might be
decades,” Peterson said.

preyed on only the
old, weak and sick
moose, and the
numbers of wolves
and moose seemed to stay about the
same year after year.

In recent years, however, startling
findings are causing textbooksto be
rewritten, said Rolf Peterson, a wild-
life biologist at Michigan Technolog-
ical University, Houghton, and director
of a long-term wolf-moose research
project sponsored by the National Park
Service.

During the 1970s and 1980s, wolf
and moose populations have fluctuat-
ed, wildly at times. From a peak of 50
in 1980, the wolves crashed to 14 two
years later. The next year, they made a
comeback, increasing to 23. Since then,

their numbers have dwindled, with;

swimming from the' mainland -- .

peaked at around 1,500 in the late
19603, then went to about 600. Only in
the last six years have they begun to
recover. - '

Researchers now realize that what
looked like a perfect balance between
wolves and moose was just a tempo-
rary plateau in a longer cycle of ups and
downs in both populations, Peterson
said.

TODAY, MOOSE are thriving. Pe-
terson and colleagues estimate there
are 1,380 moose on the island this year,
355 more than a year ago.

“That’s about seven per square
.mile, a phenomenal density compared
to mainland moose populations,” Pe-
terson said. The figure is “three times

higher than the average density of-
‘other moose populations in North

America.”

frozen &

Re vii/ell!

By the year 2000- just 13 years from ‘
now — scientists will be able to freeze
dying people and revive them years later
when a cure for their disease has been
found . . . opening the door to human im-

mortality, predict ex-
cited experts.

And, their conclusions
are not just pie in the sky
— they’re based on an as-
tonishing experiment in
which a dog was frozen
for 15 minutes, then re
vived in perfect health!

“The bottom line of ex-
periments like this is the in-
definite extension of human
life!" declared Dr. Paul Se-
gall, a research associate in
physiology at the University
of California-Berkeley who
conducted the frozen dog ex-
periment

“If you’ re about to die —
you have an incurable dis-
ease such as AIDS or Alz-
heimer's disease, or even ex-
treme old age — we could
freeze you and stop time for
you until we can cure those
diseases or reverse a condi-
tion like aging.

.rn‘What we’re looking at is

a gradual victory over death
and aging. And reversible
cryonic suspension - freez-
ing someone and then bring-
ing them back —- could be
here within 13 years!"

In Dr. Segall’s experiment
— which was conducted last
June - a 3-year-old beagle
named Miles had his body
temperature gradually low.
ered until he was ice-cold.

He was kept chilled for
15 minutes, then gradual-
ly warmed again -- and in.

HUMAN freezing should
be possible by the year
2,000 Dr Waltz predicts.

 

 

credibly, the dog revived,
healthy and happy!

“Miles came back from his
ice-cold state in great shape
—- he was his old frisky self
within five days," said Dr.
Segall. “He was romping
around, playing with his toy
bones, chasing balls, acting
just as frislq as ever. He re-
sponds'to his name, and eats
and drinks normally. He’s

exactly the same dog he was

before the experiment.”

Both before and after the
experiment. Miles has lived
with Dr. Harold Waltz, a bio-
physicist. who helped con-
duct the landmark work

“Miles is the same
friendly dog he was before
the freezing," said Dr. Waltz~
“He’ 5 just as _
lovableasev-
er. playing ~
with our two 4,,
teenage daughters.

"And he has an extremely
mild disposition. He lives
quite nicely with our cat. He’s
extremely friendly.”

What’s more, after more
than nine months Miles
“shows no signs of poor
health ” said Dr. Waltz.

“There is a strong possibil- '

ity that we will be able to
freeze and revive a human be-
ing by the year 2000'”

The implications of the
freezing technique are mind-
boggling, say the experts.
Among them:

0 Not only will freezing
allow terminally ill persons
to survive until a cure for
their disease is found but it
will also open up new possi-
bilities for organ trans-
plants which will in turn
allow people to live much
longer — perhaps indefi-
nitely.

Right now, organs taken
from a person who’s recently
died must be tranSplanted
to another person within a
very short time. '

But with the new technolo-1

83'. body organs could be

frozen for use whenever

they’re needed.

ODoctors could freeze a
patient's body, then warm
up just one diseased organ

Astonishing Procedure Could
Help Beat Disease and Aging

-— a lung or liver, for exam-
ple. The person could be in-
jected with massive doses
of drugs that would be toxic
to the body if it weren't
frozen.

The drugs would work
only on the unfrozen body
organ.

0 Bloodless surgery would
become possible. Surgeons
could freeze a patient and re—
move his blood before an
operation, keeping the blood
refrigerated. then fill the
person’s blood vessels with a

 

blood substitute. If a sur-
geon accidentally cut an ar-
tery or vein during surgery,
there would be no danger
that heavy bleeding would
make it difficult for the sur-
geon to see the area he's
working on.

Saul Kent, author of the
book “The Life-Extension
Revolution,” declared: “The
recent suspended animation
of a dog is a significant
breakthrough in the war
against aging

“Older individuals will

 

choose to enter freezing be-
fore death, with instructions
not to be revived until a

'means to stop and even re-

verse aging is discovered.
“Without a doubt, freezo
ing has the potential to make
man immortal. And we
should see our first f '
centers established within
the next 20 years — and
probably sooner!”

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - April 7, 1987

Associated Press

Washington 3 ‘ ., - .
The Supreme Court yester-
day let stand a ruling that ani-
mal welfare groups lack legal
standing to challenge federal~
financed medical experiments
performed on monkeys.

A US. Court of Appeals threw
out a lawsuit last September by the
International Primate Protection
League and People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals against a Sil-
ver Spring, Md., laboratory.

The appeals court said allowing
the suit “might Open the use of ani-
mals in biomedical research to the

hazards and vicissitudes of court--

room litigation. It might unleash a
spate of private lawsuits that would
impede advances by medical sci-
ence in the alleviation of human
suffering." . . , . , ..

The case stemmed from a com—

plaint by Alex Pacheco, a student at ..

George Washington University
here in 1981, when he worked as a
volunteer at the Institute of Behav-
ioral Research in Silver Spring.

The laboratory is studying the
capacity of monkeys to learn to use
a limb after nerves are severed. The
project, under the direction of Dr.
Edward Taub, is financed by the
National Institutes of Health to dis-
cover ways to rehabilitate humans
suffering serious neurological inju-
ry, such as a stroke. -
Pacheco said 17 monkeys hous-

ed at the laboratory were not pro-
vided sufficient food and water.
sanitation or veterinary care.

With help from the local police
and a court search warrant, Pache-
co seized the monkeys on Sept. 11,
1981. They were transferred under

'a state court order to an NIH facility

in Poolesville, Md.

Taub was convicted of six
counts of cruelty to animals, a mis-
demeanor under Maryland law car-
rying a maximum fine of $1,000 for

' each offense. The conviction was

overturned on appeal.

The animal rights groups also
sued in state court in an attempt to
block return of the monkeys to
Taub.

That case was transferred to
federal court at the request of NIH,
and a federal judge dismissed the
suit. . -~

The appeals court, in refusing

to reinstate the suit, said the con-

duct of research laboratories re-
ceiving federal aid is regulated by
the federal Animal Welfare Act.

The law empowers the secre-
tary of the US. Department of Agri-
culture to make sure that laborato-
ry animals are cared for properly
and provides for fines of up to $1,-
000 a day for offenders, the appeals
court said.

The case is international Pri- '3

enough money to buy apiece of
land and build the Grinegan Farm
for Differently-Abled Animals into
the kind of haven they can only
dream of now. Maybe then Dancer,
the arthritic duck, will have a real
pond to splash in instead of a
glorified washtub, and Mask, the
Russian Muscovoy duck with a
deformed wing, will have the space '
to live out his days in dignity.

“We’re not really a foster home," ,
Grizzard said. “This is the end of
the line for a lot of these guys. Our
purpose is just to give them a place
to be.” '

Grinegan Farm’s address is PO.
Box 1048, Ojai, Calif. 93023. The
proprietors say they can’t adopt any
more dogs and they don't have

farm chores done before they both
leave for work. They change the
water trays, and distribute break-
fast—duck feed for the ducks, hay
for. the goats and veggies for the
rabbits. They collect any eggs laid
overnight, and hand-feed Baby,
the cockatoo. She likes applesauce
and corn puffs. . .

On weekends when there’s more
time to 'devote to farming, Grizzard
and Finnegan—sometimes with
the help of a few friends—rake the
pens, Rototill the land, trim the
goats’ hoofs (once they had a
buck—toothed rabbit whose teeth
had to be trimmed weekly) and.
lavish attention on the clan.

Every night they herd all 11
ducks into a pen for protection from

_‘ Women Know‘ How to
'-' Keep Unwanted Animals
- Down on the Farm

By ANN J APENGA, Times Staff Writer

SANTA PAULA, Calif—Some people like living on a farm for
the soothing certainties to be found there. Corn grows, ducks fly,
hens roost. . p ‘

_ But take a closer look at a backyard farm here and you’ll see a
cast of animals no one ever mentioned in Old MacDonald. There’s a
duck named Dancer, crippled by arthritis, a flightless Canadian
goose with an amputated wing, and a hen with a deformed foot who
requires a custom-designed roost to stay perched. *

Disabled animals are part of almost any barnyard. If folks rarely
see them, that’s because they’re often “culled out,” a euphemism

. for being killed. Lynn Grizzard saw this happening when she

' worked as a Santa Paula veterinarian’s assistant. When clients
brought in disabled animals, they were usually put to sleep or sold
at auction for meat. -

Grizzard, 32, began taking the doomed animals home with her—a
brain-damaged eat here, a broken-billed duck there. '

“It was hard to say no to anyone,” she said. '

Now Grizzard and her partner Devon Finnegan, 26, are
ringleaders of what may become a burgeoning disabled animals”.
liberation movement. As proprietors of the Grinegan Farm for
Differently-Abled Animals, the two declare that a disabled duck
that cost 75 cents has as much right to live as a healthy
thoroughbred racehorse. As Finnegan said, “A life’s a life.”

Fe."

Sanitarium for Disabled Critters

When the two acquired their first charges three years ago, '
among them a trio of cats named Peace, Freedom and Justice, their
rented house was not set up as a sanitarium for disabled critters;
and the two didn’t have the money to fix it up. (Finnegan is a .
special education teacher and Grizzard now works at an exotic bird

 

farm in Ojai.) They made do, however. They found a bunch of wire;
someone donated chain-link fencing . . . and the animals kept
arriving.

The two are now housemothers to two goats, three dogs, three
cats, six chickens, one guinea hen, 11 ducks, five rabbits, two
cockateels, a cockatoo, a Canadian goose and an Egyptian goose, an

and which is currently convalescing in the bathroom.
Expenses have grown with the increasing head count. Chicken
feed alone costs Finnegan and Grizzard about $100 a month, and

their gas bill has soared since they have been keeping the house ‘

warmer than usual for their Moluccan cockatoo, Baby. (Baby has
beak-and-feather syndrome, a disease that weakens her feathers
sothat they break off and provide little warmth. The condition is

usually fatal in cockatoos, which can live to 70 years or more.)

Grizzard and Finnegan survive the lean months by eating
vegetables from their garden supplemented with large portions of
rice. -

“We may not have a lot of money to go to the grocery store, but
the animals always eat,” said Grizzard. “They eat us out of house
and home, but there are compensations,” she added. “I have never
known an animal to be quite as entertaining as a duck.”

On a sunny Saturday, while other people play softball or go to the
movies, these two take their amusement in the backyard. There’s a
new duck pond with a specially constructed access ramp for the
mobility-impaired fowl. The farm proprietors never seem to tire of
watching Dancer waddle up the ramp, her feet slapping noisily,

Duck That Charges Dogs

Elsewhere in the yard, they might see Daffodil Bill, a duck,
charge after any dog that has the misfortune to wander into the

. enclosure. (Daffodil Bill lost half his bill in a fight, and since then

has shown an affinity for attacking others. Because of the bill
deformity, he requires a deep dish for dining.)

Or, if Bill is feeling docile, they might watch Mime, the lame
guinea hen (her face is masked with white like a mime) spar with
the king of the chickens, Banana, one of the able—bodied animals 0
the farm. '

Seriously impaired animals such as Pepper, a Plymouth Rock
hen, are kept in separate enclosures because chickens will
sometimes attack an injured animal, Grizzard said. Pepper has a
twisted, leg, the result of a birth defect. Her foot points in the wrong
direction, and she drags it about.

Grizzard said they intend to shell out funds for an operation to
have the leg amputated (they have spent as much as $1,000 in .
veterinary bills for a single animal) but until then, Pepper gets
along on daily doses of human small talk and affection.

Pepper is one of many residents the farm got from the Santa
Paula feed and supply store, the Mill. It’s the place where local

_ farmers take unwanted animals to be adopt-ed. Grizzard said the
clerks at the Mill are always happy to see the Grinegan Farm duo
3 approaching because if they have a particularly hard-to-place

animal on hand, they know Lynn and Devon are likely to take it
ome.

SAN FRANCISCO CORONICLE - April 2, 1987

Bills
by Police

vs i

By Michael Taylor
Embarrassed Vallejo au-
thorities said yesterday they
will foot the veterinary bills for
a pet dog that police shotgun-
ned nearly to death in a contro-
versial hunt for wild canines.

The little-known practice of
shooting feral dogs inside the city
limits —— something that happens in
about 1 percent of Calif ornia’s ani-
mal control districts -— has stirred
up a ferocious debate in Solano
County because of the apparently
random nature of the wild dog
hunts. ‘

“This (incident) certainly gives
us pause for reflection on the pro-

cess,” City Attorney John Towers ,

said yesterday, as he tried to piece
together information about what

police now call an “unfortunate ac- i

cident.”

“We agreed to pay the veteri-
narian's bills because, well. let‘s say
we felt it was the right thing to do,"
Towers said. "We should try to take
care of the dog."

The shooting occurred last,

week when three Vallejo reserve
police officers went to the 900 block
of Wilson Avenue to find stray dogs.

According to Robert Schantz,
his Swear-old black Labrador nam-
ed B.A. was on the porch, minding
hisown business, when the three
officers started chasing a pack of
dogs coming out of a nearby marsh.

At some point, one of the offi-
cers was told by a neighbor that
B.A.,,with his sleek, wellfed black
coat, bright red collar and happy-
dog demeanor, was definitely not a
stray.-.

*But because that information
‘was “regrettably not communicat-
cd in a timely manner" to another
officer, said Acting Police Chief
Roy Conway, the police blasted the
pet with buckshot.

_ “They chased my dog off the ‘
_ porch.” Schantz said angrily yester- .

day. “And when he jumped off,
they shot him, which has got me
. pretty upset.”

n... .._- __...,_..._

 

“He wasn’t bothering any-

body.” said Schantz, a 28-year—old

automobile body repair shop man-
ager. who lives alone with his dog.
“He’s by no means a vicious dog.
He’s always around kids.”

One of the officers rushed B.A.
(Schantz said it originally stood for
“Bad Attitude”) to All Creatures
Veterinary Hospital, where Dr. Rob-

ert Linville said the dog would have ,
died if had arrived 30 minutes later. j

The shotgun blast broke both 3
the dog’s front legs and his jaw. He '
suffered “numerous wounds” and g

was in critical condition. He‘s start

ing to get better, Linville said, and

has been a' most cooperative pa-
tient, a “really sweet, friendly dog.”

The dog was a victim of an ani-

mal control policy that animal wel. ,
fare experts said went completely
awry and could stand a great deal of

improvement.

Earlier this week. after a meet-
ing between Vallejo city officials
and representatives of local and na-
tional animal welfare groups, there
seemed to be little agreement on
what Vallejo should do next.

Conway said shooting wild dogs
is only a “practice of last resort,”
and his department is “evaluating
information on how to be moreef-
fective in dealing with the feral dog
problem." Then, he said, he will re-

, port to the city manager on “what,

if any, changes should be made.”

He denied that the reserve offi-
cers chased the dog from the porch,
but said “unfortunately, it was an
accident, and we‘ve admitted that.”

Last week, when the incident _'
occurred. three stray dogs were kill-

ed. In 1986. Conway said, six dogs

. were shot to death. Some of them ,
were dogs who attacked police offi- '-
> cers serving search warrants and
: others were feral dogs.

 

Eric Sakach, an investigator for
the Humane Society of the United
States‘ western regional office, said
the dog hunt was “outrageous. It‘s
the silliest thing in the world.”

He and other animal experts

' said feral dogs —- animals with no

owners and which have become
completely wild and sometimes
dangerous — normally are trapped

in cages or attracted to large “feed.
ing stations.” Animals that regular-
ly come to feed at the corraled stao
tions eventually get trapped and
hauled off to the pound.

The dogs usually are held for 72
hours and then destroyed if nobody
wants them. It‘s unusual, experts
say, for animal control officers to

 

shoot stray dogs in cities.

Letters:

Pet food

In response to a letter by
Charles Hardage, “Shame” (8-0
March 27), at least the Editor in-
terpreted scripture correctly. But
it would be a shame indeed to
leave the impression that pet own-
ers are responsible for the world’s

. starving children.

1) Most of the food for pets
could not be used for human con-
sumption, but the fact that it IS.
used makes human food cheaper.

2) Animals were put here for
our care and that care provides
thousands of jobs which help keep
starvation down in the U.S.A.

3) Many pet lovers, I feel sure,
have contributed to agencies
which provide food and emergen-
cy supplies to needy people.

4) Much of the Third World’s
problems have been. caused by
poor leadership which has shifted
agricultural economies to non-pro—
ductive efforts.

Now, if you want to point out
what is pitiful, Mr. Hardage could
have mentioned DRUGS -— where
billions are involved — an industry
that provides wealth to a worth-
less element in our society.

Jimmy Buffett sounds serious

note for threatened animals

By STEVE PIACENTE
Tribune Staff Writer

, WASHINGTON -— Singer and
part-time environmentalist Jimmy
Buffett’s view is this:

“If we as humans want to as-
sume the role of the landlord, then
we have to take care of all the ten-
ants.”

That in mind, Buffett took his
act to Capitol Hill Tuesday, where a
Senate panel discussed funding for
the Endangered Species Act. The
panel wants more money to fund
the act, the Reagan administration,
less. More than $25 million sepa-
rates the two sides.

Crying the federal deficit blues,
an administration spokesman said,
“All the money we would want is
not available. Unfortunately, the en-
dangered species program is not the

only program with a claim on the
. treasury.” ‘

Buffett, a silent spectator during
this part of the show, watched as

,Frank Dunkle, director of the US.
Fish and Wildlife Service, absorbed
', many blows from the subcommittee

. wm4‘-~:‘ -

on environmental protection.
Senators pointed out the number
of plants and animals on the endan-
gered list has grown by 150, from
776 since 1982. Dunkle already
knew. The cost of gathering infor-
mation on the new species also has

7 .gone .way up. Dunkle knew.

Finally, under questioning,
Dunkle revealed the real culprit
was not the wildlife service, but the
Office of Management and Budget,
which had slashed the proposed
amount by 15 percent, to a point
where spending levels would equal
what was spent in 1979.

That let Dunkle off the hook and
set the stage for Buffett, who looked
not like a superstar, but like any
average 40-year-old guy pleading
his case to a bunch of politicians.

Dressed more casually than
most who testify before congressio-
nal committees, Buffett said it was
his pal on the panel, Sen. Bob Gra-
ham, D-Fla.,-who drafted him to
speak on the Florida manatee.

It was former Gov. Graham, in
fact, who piqued Buffett’s environ-
mental consciousness several years

ago, appointing him chairman of a
new "Save the Manatee Commis-
sion. ”

Buffett has proven a loyal fol-
lower. During a reception thrown in
his honor Monday night, Buffett
said concern over environmental
matters under new Gov. Bob Marti-
nez “is not near the level it was dur-
ing the Graham years.”

Responded J .M. “Mac” Stipanov-
ich, Martinez’s top aide, “I don’t
know why he’d say that and I’m not
sure he knows why either.”

As for the 1,000 or so manatees '
that are left, the biggest danger is
that boats are hitting them, Buffett
said.

_ _“Their encounter with man,
their only natural predator, has tru-
ly taken its toll,” he said. ,

Calling for passage of the En-
dangered Species Act, he added,
“We still face the day-to-day prob-
lems -— irresponsible boatoperators
in our waterways, developers only
interested in profits, not responsibil-
ities.

“But the tide is changing," he
said. .

‘Pit bulldogs kill”
retiree, toddler
in separate cases

An Associated Press Report

Homicide detectives were called in Tuesday to in-
vestigate an attack by pit bulldogs that killed a retired
physician and injured another person in Dayton, Ohio,
on the same day a toddler was killed by a pit bull in
Oklahoma. "

Coincidentally, an Ohio House panel in Columbus
began hearings Tuesday on a bill to penalize owners
who fail to control dangerous or vicious dogs.

William G. Eckman, 67, of Kettering, Ohio, died dur-
ing surgery at Good Samaritan Hospital after he was
attacked by two dogs at a house on the city’s north side
Monday, a hospital spokeswoman said. He screamed
for help and tried to escape the animals by climbing on
a car, witnesses said. ,

Montgomery County coroner’s investigator J .R. Wil-
liams said Eckman might have died of a heart attack,
but a ruling on the cause of death was deferred.

One of the dogs’ owners, Joetta Darmstadter, .32,
was bitten, apparently as she tried to help Eckman,
witnesses and police said. She was in fair condition
Tuesday but refused interviews, Good Samaritan
spokeswoman Joyce Lutz said.

Dennis Langer, first assistant Montgomery County
prosecutor, said there was the possibility a felony
charge of involuntary manslaughter might be filed, but
he declined to comment further.

“It’s going to take a while because of the unusual
facts here,” said Lt. Dan Baker, commander of the
police violent-crimes unit. “Dogs are a little hit new to
us. We’re used to dealing with violent people.” ’

Williams said that Eckman apparently was in the

house when the attack started and that Darmstadter, .
who was wearing only a sheet, may have let the dogs ‘

into the house.

“Why? We don’t know. That’s why we have homi— ;

cide looking into it,” Williams said.

Witnesses said Eckman ran from the house and

.‘Ea'. ‘1}. , ._

screamed and tried to climb to safety on a carthat

stopped, but was pulled off by the dogs.

’ Dayton City Commissioner Abner Orick said he
asked the city law department to draw up an ordinance
outlawing pit bulldogs.

In Columbus, an Ohio House committee held a hear-
ing on a bill that would make it a misdemeanor to fail
to keep dogs judged dangerous securely confined. The
bill is sponsored by Rep. Robert Hickey of Dayton, who
said Humane Society records show 15 Ohioans died as a
result of dog attacks in 1986.

Police in Jones, Okla, were investigating the death

of a 16-month-old girl killed Monday by a pit bull

owned by her parents.

“No charges have been filed, but all information .

will be presented to the District Attorney’s Office,” said
police Maj. Bob Kerr.

The child, whose name was not released, was found ,
by a cousin in the yard where a pit bull was chained ,

. behind the family’s mobile home, Kerr said.

DETROIT FREE PRESS - April 7, 1987

q. a. .a' .4,- t’qaf ”Q; was w

to save rain forests ‘

Associated Press

YOKOHAMA, Japan — Although
they didn’t agree on everything, 40
timber producing and consuming na-
tions have decided to take their first
practical steps toward saving the
world’s tropical rain forests.

Some conservationists say rain for-
ests are disappearing rapidly and that
uncontrolled logging is the chief cause.

Member nations of the Internation-
al Tropical Timber. Organization
reached the decision after a week of
meetings here last month. .

Outside conservationists view the

outcome with some optimism. “It’s
justifiable to say progress has been
made; it’s a turning point,” said Charles
Secrett, tropical rain forest campaign
vco-ordinator for the London-based
Friends of the Earth International, and
[one of several international conserva-
tionists who attended as observers.

“Prior to this meeting there was a
very real danger of the whole thing
collapsing. But we’re having to balance

,_ small gains against a lot of inaction. It’s
a bit like a patient on a life-support
system — it’s still alive but not cured.”

He and others estimate only seven
or eight decades remain before the
forests disappear, and with them, near-
ly half the world’s species. Some warn
that such destruction could mean a
mass extinction on a scale not seen
since the time of the dinosaurs.

Already, excessive logging and its
aftereffects have destroyed half the
world’s tropical rain forests, which
make up seven percent of the earth’s
land. Each year 50 million more acres
disappear.

THE TIMBER organization, which
includes 22 consuming countries and
18 producers, will administer the Inter-

national Tropical Timber Agreement, a

global commodity pact approved two
’ years ago after 10 years of debate.

The agreement emphasizes re-
search and market studies and is the
only such pact with conservation as a
chief aim.

The meetings also brought progress
on funding. Members allocated
$640,000 for preliminary work on proj-

ects ranging from market studies in

4 -_.- K..-_a..~ _‘_

Italy to broad programs of conserva-
tion in Asia, Africa and Latin America,
the three main producing regions.
Christopher Rose, campaigns offi-
cer for the World Wide Fund for
Nature International, said he had wor-
ried that members were not taking the

timber pact seriously, but “now we see.

it will become a functioning organiza-
tion with its own identity.”

HOST-COUNTRY Japan largely
avoided the conservationists’ ire, after

. years of being assailed as a prime cause

of tropical forest devastation. .

Japan, which imports mainly from
Southeast Asia, is the largest user of
forest products, consuming 20 percent
of all products sold on world markets.
Importing mainly raw logs instead of

— euphemistically called a “regis-

an example of arrogant ignorance
in a position of power.

In effect, this is a tax which
masquerades as a humanitarian
effort to limit the number of home-

The fact of the matter is that

i the people who abandon pets or .

allow them to roam the streets
freely do not care enough about
them to have them vaccinated.
Call it what you will, this tax
will certainly discourage many pet

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - March 30, 1987

How Lave Saved a Sno

 

 

BYE/ll SNYDER

aren Durey likes to call
herself a seeing-eye
person.

‘ ' For the past tWo
years, she has been keeper, guide,
eyes, and perhaps most important,
friend to one of the world’s most
elusive animals: a snow leopard.

, Rare as any snow leOpard
would be — there may be as few as
2,000 in the world —- this one is
even more unusual. Tashacur,
whose name means “Thank you”
in Pashto, has been blind from
birth. ‘ '
“Life in the wild is very
tough. She never would have had
a chance,” said Durey. .

Actually, Tashacur normally
wouldn’t have had much of a
chance in captivity, either.

‘ Since her blindness may have
been genetic, the 70pound cat will

never be allowed to breed. And a 5

rare animal that can’t reproduce
and needs constant care is a sure
bet to be put to sleep, Durey said.

But soon after her birth at the
San Francisco Zoo in 1985, Tashac-
ur was adopted by Marine World
Africa USA, now in Vallejo.

Tasha, as her keepers call her,
isn’t called on to do much per-
forming. Sighted animals would

probably attack her, and she re- -;

fuses to be handled by anyone but
Durey. - -

‘flt’s a situation we normally
try to discourage,” said keeper
Lynn Myers. The big cats are
much too dangerous to treat like
pets, and because keepers come
and go it is better to keep them
from becoming too dependent on
any one person, she said. 4

“But Tasha is special,” Myers
admitted. ‘

' During the cub’s training pe-
riod, she rejected her keepers one
by one, before finally settling on
Durey. “Most cats seem to like be-
ing with more than one person,

 

But a glance at the animal’s .
curved, inch-long teeth, heavy Jaw
muscles and long yellow claws IS a 3
quick reminder that the snow

leopard could never really be a
pet. ' ; '
Durey has a web of fine scars

‘ on her forearm, reminders of vari-

ous “playful” sessions with her
charges. “Working with big cats is
a little like being a boxer,” she
said. “After a while you don’t even
notice that you’re bleeding.”

In her natural habitat, the re-
mote and rugged mountains of
central Asia, Tasha would hunt for
wild sheep and goats, her dappled,
whitish brown coat serving as
camouflage in the rocky, snow-
covered terrain.

While not as fast as her cousin

the cheetah, a snow leopard can
easily outrun most animals over a

. short sprint and cassleap.__1_§f99t;__ .5

but maybebecause Tasha is blind
she needs the constancy of just

one,” Durey said.

While Durey talked, Tasha
laid her sleek head in her keeper’s
lap, rolled on to her back to invite
a tummy rub and in general acted
like an overgrown house cat.

w”

Thick, padded paws give ex-
tra stability and serve as snow-
shoes, allowing the snow leopard
to walk without breaking through
the crusted mountain snow. Be-

, cause food is scarce at high alti- ‘

gtudes, snow leopards tend to be

small; a full-grown male weighs
only about 100 pounds.

Tasha’s most striking feature

is her thick, fur coat with its char-

, acteristic elongated black spots.

' Despite years of protection and m-

; ternational agreements, snow

,

. leopards still are hunted for their
. pelts.
T Snow leopard coats, made
L from the pelts of about 10 animals,
‘ fetch as much as $80,000 on the
§ black market, said Helen Free-
man, a Washington state scientist
who helped found the Internation-
al Snow Leopard Trust.
But a larger threat to the sur-
vival of the leopards is the contin-
ual encroachment of civilization

ShOoting of dog prompts %
protest in Lutz neighborhood

By KARLA KINNEY
Tribune Correspondent

LUTZ — A second dog shooting
in northwestern Hillsborough Coun-
ty has pushed an emotional group of
Lutz residents to protest how animal
cruelty cases are handled.

A small group of residents gath-
ered in front of the Acacia Street
home of neighbor Ed Hendrix Fri-
day evening who they allege shot a
pit bull who later had to be put to
sleep.

“I think what we’re trying to say
is that they need to upgrade the
penalty for animal cruelty from a
misdemeanor to a third-degree felo-
ny,” said Joe Gault of 3716 Lutz-
Lake Fern Road, whose pit bull
Bandit was shot Thursday after-
noon.

“1 was protecting my property,”
Hendrix said.

Earlier in the week Bandit had
“chewed a hole” in the fence sur-
rounding Hendrix’s yard at 3223
Acacia St. to “get at” his yellow
Labrador retriever, Penny, who is
in heat, Hendrix said. Thursday af-
ternoon Hendrix left work to take
Penny to the veterinarian as a re-
sult of the mating of the two ani-

mals. When he arrived home and

looked in his back yard, he saw
Bandit “on top of my dog.”

“The dog showed me its teeth
and held its ground,” said Hendrix,
“so I grabbed my .410 (caliber shot-
gun).” He said he shot the dog,
which took off running and ended
up across the street in another
neighbor’s yard.

Neighborhood residents who
heard the commotion called the
Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Of-
fice.

Lawana Kerley, of3229 Lutz-
Lake Fern Road, was upset because
there were small children in the ar-
ea when Hendrix fired the shot, in-
cluding her children, 4-year-old Ta-
mara and 2-year-old Steven.

“What bothers me is that he shot
off a shotgun in a residential neigh-
borhood,” Kerley said at the gather-
ing of residents Friday. “It is very
possible that when he shot the gun
off that my kids could’ve been out
in the yard.”

Sheriff’s Deputy J. Mauk re-
sponded to the call and took a re-
port.

Lt. R. Goding of the Sheriff’s Of-
fice explained that since the appli-
cable charges, animal cruelty and
reckless display of a firearm, are
misdemeanors that were not wit-
nessed by a deputy, the standard
procedure is to give the victim
(Bandit’s owner) a request for pros-
ecution voucher to fill out and send

to the State Attorney’s Office. 'l‘he

state attorney then reviews the case
and decides whether to summon the
accused to answer the charges.

“A physical arrest is not in-
volved,” Goding further explained.

Since Gault, the dog’s owner,
was not at the scene at the time of
the shooting, the Sheriff’s Office
was unable to deliver the document
until Friday evening. .

Some neighborhood residents
believe authorities are taking the
case too lightly.

Jerry Ficca of 102 Lake Allen
Road said, “That gentleman (Hen-
drix) should’ve been arrested. The
way it’s being handled legally is un-
fair to the owners and the animals
themselves ”

Ficca’s dog Rusty reportedly
had been shot by a neighbor about
two weeks earlier in an incident
similiar to Bandit’s. Ficca had
mailed his request for prosecutiOn
promptly, and is still waiting to hear
from the State Attorney’s Office. '-

“When I filled out the form, I.
demanded that he (the neighbor
who shot Rusty) be prosecuted. I’ve
never received a response. These
people are not being prosecuted,”
Ficca said.

Bandit’s owner, Gault, said he
will fill out the request for prosecu-
tion and mail it today.

“I don’t wish the man any ill,
but he’s got to know he can’t be en-
dangering the lives of people and
animals,” Gault said.

Hendrix believes his neighbors
are overly upset.

“I can't believe these people are
acting this way,” he said in a phone
interview Friday afternoon. “If it
had happened to them, I’m sure
most of them would’ve done the
same thing. ”

. Peacocks may be pretty to look at, but Sonoma County residents will tell you they moire lousy neighbors

o

. ‘ Rude, Crude and Stupid Peacbcks

 

f   , The

By George Snyder

Sonoma County residents are find-
“.lng out that peacocks, famed for their
beautiful plumage, have other traits
that are not so attractive. '

Flocks of love-crazed peafowl are cele-
brating the spring mating season by rampag-
ing across wide sections of the county, letting
out piercing shrieks as they destroy gardens

and decorate homes and other buildings with

their droppings -'

“We're getting complaints from all over
the county," said Barry Evans, Sonoma County
animal regulation chief. “People are getting
mad at them. '

“Peacocks do terrible damage to gardens,
especially at this time of year, when people are
starting to put them in,” he said. “And they are
very prolific. Not only that, they roost up in
trees, so they're pretty safe from predators."

Evans has no idea how many of the birds
-— which weigh as much as 20 pounds — are
living in Sonoma County, but he says there
seem to be a lot~

“We've had calls from Windsor, the Peta-
luma area and over in the Russian River area,"
Evans said. “People are telling us the flocks

are getting bigger and bigger, too.”

. Some people have reported flocks of more
than 60 birds. A woman whose neighbor im-
ported a few of the birds into her Occidental-
area neighborhood a couple of years ago has
seen the flock grow to nearly 100. ' .

"it’s become a real problem around here,
what with the noise, the wrecked gardens and
the poop," said the woman, who out of fear of
stoking already high neighborhood feeling,
declined to be identified. "People are starting
to talk lawsuits.”

Word of the spreading peacock problem
also surfaced at a recent meeting of the Sono-

ma County Citizen's Fish and Wildlife Adviso-

ry Board. -.
' "We've been getting all kinds of calls.”

 

CAROLYN JOHNSON ' '
She blames the birds' former owners

said Martha Bentley, a worker at the Sonoma
County Bird Rescue Center in Santa Rosa.

' “I had a call from a guy in Windsor who
said they were driving him crazy.” she said.
“They sit up in those trees, especially in spring-
time, and put out blood-curdling screams.
They scare the living daylights out of people.”

Bentley, whose‘organization helps reha-
bilitate various types of injured birds, refuses
all requests to take in peafowl. "We turn them
down fiat.” she said. .

. The local Humane Society, however. ac-
cepts the birds at its shelter between Sebasto
pol and Santa Rosa.

someplace."

érés $enomu Hales

Animal experts believe many of the birds
once belonged to humans who thought the
birds beautiful but turned them loose after
getting to know them better.

“it‘s one of the worst ways to deal with
animals, domestic or wild,” said Carolyn John-
son, a Sebastopol-area resident and a member
of the board of directors of the nonprofit,
Cotati-based. Sonoma County Wildlife Rehabil-
itation Center. “You should never turn domes
tic animals loose or take wild animals from
their environment"

Springtime is a particularly obnoxious
time for the peafowl, since one male will at-
tract and keep a large harem of hens while
other young males stand around screeching
their frustration.

And although the peacocks, with their
colorful, shimmering tail feathers, may be
beautiful, they also are very stupid, Johnson
said. _

“In spring, they get real territorial, ﬂuff
up their feathers and fight off other males,"
she said. “That includes, however, reflections
in plate glass windows and shiny bumpers on
cars. I‘ve had to drape towels over my bumpers
to keep the birds off, it‘s so bad."

Animal control chief Evans says people
with peacock problems should not expect help
from the county. _ ‘

"‘1 had my fill of them when I was working
in Southern California," Evans said. “I once
chased one from rooftop to rooftop in some
tract development for i don’t know how long.
They can leap tall buildings in a single bound. -
they can fly through the air with the speed of a
bullet, they're tougher than a bullet -- i know
because one of my co-workers tried to eat one
once. They‘re like Superman."

"The only hope is to find somebody who
likes them,” he said. “i’m sure there are a few

7’ es, the dogs we1 e sweet and the
"= kittens were cute and even Schuyler
the sickly macaw exuded some
Technicolor charm.

But what Solange J udnich really wanted
was the snake. Please.

She could give it a good home. She had
other snakes to keep it company. She was
moving into a trailer, and her snakes could
have their own room. And look—one of her
tattoos, the one on her ankle, was a snake.

' “They're very loving animals,” even the
rattlesnake she once had. “They feel good,
they feel muscly and soft . . you get
attached to those creepy crawlers."

l Rufus, the reticulated python.

The math alone was against it, a classic
study of supply and demand—~and demand
and demand and demand. '

_ At the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals’ Los Angeles shelter, more than
400 people waited in line in hOpes of adopting
one of 17 neglected animals seized from a
Torrance pet shop in 1987.

Only now—~after being held more than a
year as evidence in the prosecution of the
shop owner, who has pleaded no .

first homes in their lives.

With cages and sacks and ropes and boxes,
they began gathering before 8 am. for the

Do you own your own home, they wanted to

“We’ve put a lot of time and money and

seven birds, a snake, four cats and five
dogs—the four turtles having been adopted.
by the veterinarian who treated them.

“We know the animals best and we want
the best for them."

Whetstone had to say no to a woman with
nine other pets who wanted to make sure
none of the 17 was put to sleep and to the
celebrity-struck who wanted an animal that
had been on TV.

“We didn’t want people taking them just
because they’re status symbols, because they
came out of the [raided] store," she said.

She said no too to a father whose son, Jason,

wanted Bear, one of the two Samoyeds.

“Bear really can’t be trusted with small
children,” Whetstone argued.

“J ason’s great with animals, and he's got
his heart set on it.”

“I know, sir, I know. We don't want
anything to happen to Jason, and we don’t
want anything to happen to Bear. We have
some other nice puppies. . . .”

The boy buried his face in his father’s leg
and cried.

“C’mon, Jason,” said his father, hefting him
to his shoulder. “Let's get outta here.”

Moments later, he was back. “No way? No
way at all? For a kid?"

No was the reply.

They left again, for good.

“Boy,” Whetstone sighed, “people are
gonna hate me when this day’s over.”

Such people “are thinking here”——she
pointed to her heart—“they’re not thinking
up here”-—-moving her hand to her head.
“They’re not thinking if that dog bit that kid’s
fingers off.”

By late afternoon, the block-long line had
dwindled; at every update (“No snake, the
snake’s adopted") a few more drifted away.
The pet snobs came and went. “Aren’t there
any shar pei puppies? We were led to believe
they had purebreds,” sniffed one woman.

Tiny, the hydrocephalic toy fox terrier with
a pin in her leg, found a home. So did Silver,

Dead, starving pets

 

By PATTI ROTH
smnwma

FORT LAUDERDALE — In what was
called an extreme case of animal neglect, a.
variety of snakes, tarantulas, turtles and
scorpions were found without food or water
in an abandoned reptile store on Thursday.

Some of the animals were dead. Others
were alive, but weak and dehydrated.

“This is an extreme case. of animal abuse -
total negli ence,” said June Curran, a board
member 0 the Wildlife Care Center and one
of the handlers who picked up the animals
and took them to undisclosed locations.

“I would think that starvation, neglect -—
you can see the dehydration -— it’s a terrible
death,” she said. “They are creatures with
feelings.”

The store, Reptiles 8: Such Inc., on the sec-
ond floor of a shoppin plaza at 501 NE 13th
St., had been closed or about three weeks,
according to a teen-ager who said he regular-
ly visited it.

Lt. Thomas Quinn, wildlife inspector for
the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission, said he will try to track down
the shopkeeper, whose identity could not be

Quinn said the animals were in good health
when he visited-the sh0p about three weeks
ago on a routine inspection.

On Thursday, many of the animals that

were still alive were in poor condition, dis-
eased and had external parasites and were
suffering from the heat.

“You’re taking an animal in a caged situa-
tion that hasno where to go,” he said. “So you
must provide for its needs. It cannot provide
for itself on its own.”

The owner of the building, Michael Wood,
said he flew in from Atlanta, where he lives,
because he had not heard from the tenant
who rented the shop for about two months.

Registered letters to the shOp went unan-

‘ swered, and the phone had been disconnect-

ed, Wood said. He said he did not know where
the shapkeeper lived.

When he went to the store on Thursday,
Wood said, he found the door locks jammed,
the air conditioning off, two snakes were
loose on the floor and the store had an almost
unbearable order.

“I love animals,” he said. “It’s a terrible,
terrible thing.”

Before wildlife workers arrived, Jay Coul-
son, 28, of Fort Lauderdale, happened by the
shop and offered to take the only two living
tarantulas. - .

“I can’t stand to see them tortured
this,” he said.

Coulson said the tarantulas obviously were
parched. When he poured water in their
bowls, one of the tarantulas jumped up.

“He ran right to it,” Coulson said.

mauled by a tiger cub at a wild-
life park in Devon.

Passers-by and handlers strug-
gled to free Robert Gardner
(above), as he was attacked by the
cub, which was being walked to
its cage at Sparkwell Wildlife
Park, near Plymouth.

Robert, of Gloucester Road,

overnight in hospital in

Plymouth.

Robert’s father, David, 33,

when I saw Robert screaming
‘Daddy’ and covered in blood. We
put his shirt over his head to
keep the wound intact and to try

Horses mistreated,
Humane Society says

By Domenica Marchetti
News Staff Writer

Several horses on a farm owned
by Barton Greenberg, the recently
jailed chairman of Diamond Mort-
gage Corp., appear to be starving
and neglected, according to the
Michigan Humane Society and the
Genessee County veterinarian.

Greenberg’s wife, Nancy, who

Road (M-ls), just north of Oak

denied that the horses are being
mistreated.

She said all of the 14 horses on
the farm, with the exception of one
filly that is sick. “are in beautiful
shape and perfect health.”

Pinkston said Mrs. Greenberg
voluntarily allowed him to take
blood samples from some of the
horses. The blood analysis will
determine whether or not the hors-
es are malnourished, and whether
the county will pursue animal cru-
elty charges, he said. .

Barton Greenberg, 45, who also
was president of the Diamond
Mortgage subsidiary, A.J. Obie and
Associates, pleaded no contest in
February to a charge of obtaining
money under false pretenses. He is
serving up to 10 years in prison.

Greenberg and a company offi-

Tuna: The Unseen Cost

”Incidental take" is a euphe-
mism the tuna industry uses in
referring to dolphins and other
marine mammals that are rou-
tinely killed along with the
tuna catch. Public awareness
of the dolphin slaughter con-
tributed to passage of the Ma-
rine Mammal Protection Act
(MFA) in 1972, which placed
quotas on the number of dol-
phins U.S. tuna fishermen
could legally kill. But just as
Congressional hearings for the
reauthorization of the MFA
began a few months ago, some
disturbing new evidence came
to light suggesting that the
number of dolphins dying at
the hands of fishermen is
much higher than anyone pre-
viously thought.

The evidence surfaced
earlier this year when the en-
vironmental group Green-
peace obtained a copy of an
unpublished report compiled
by the National Marine Fisher-
ies Service (NMFS) indicating
that dolphin stocks have been
severely depleted. Based on
information from this and
other reports, environmental
groups now estimate that
more than 100,000 dolphins
are being killed annually by
US. and foreign tuna ﬂeets.
”At that rate,” says Dean Wil-
kinson, a Greenpeace spokes-
man, "[the fishermen] are
probably killing animals be-
yond the biological capacity of
the stocks to replenish them-
selves."

DUllJiLiJlb cut, 01 LL11 Mlcu
along with tuna because fish-
ermen use a technique called
“setting on dolphin.” Yellow-
fin tuna (sold in cans labeled
“chunk light") tend to school
under objects ﬂoating near the
water’s surface. Yellowﬁns es-
pecially like to school beneath
dolphins. Knowing this, fish-
ermen often use dolphins as
“tuna indicators," setting purse
seine nets around dolphins in
hopes of catching any tuna
swimming below them. Once
the fishermen have encircled
the dolphins with nets that can
be up to a mile in length, they
draw the net closed by pulling
on drawstrings with a large
winch.

 

Even if no tuna are captured
in the procedure, dolphins cer-
tainly are. Sam LaBudde, a
former U .3. government biol-
ogist who now works with the
Marine Mammal Fund, posed
as a ﬁsherman for five months
on a Panamanian tuna boat
and videotaped the carnage he
witnessed. A recent press re-
lease from Earth Island Insti-
tute, an environmental group
based in San Francisco, sum-
marized LaBudde's account of
the experience. In one espe-
cially disastrous purse seine

pleted."

Estimates of dolphin popu-
lations are hard to verify. They
are based on observations of
tuna ﬁshermen conducted by
monitoring groups, such as the
Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission (IATTC), which
count the number of marine
mammals killed as tuna fisher-
men haul in their nets. In a re-
port issued last year, the LATTC
estimated that 124,000 to
130,000 dolphins were killed
by the world’s tuna ﬂeets in
1986, making it the worst year
for dolphin mortality in a
decade.

Netting yellowfin ("light”) tuna, unlike hooking albacore { "white "
Meat), causes the death of more than 100,000 dolphins a year.

 

set, LaBudde said, "nearly 200
dolphins were slowly drowned
over the course of two hours,
and all we caught was a single
tuna."

According to Greenpeace
estimates, some dolphin
stocks (noninterbreeding sub-
species), including popula-
tions of spotted, spinner and
coastal dolphins, have been
reduced by as much as 80 per-
cent. A few stocks, such as the
eastern and Costa Rican spin-
ners, are apparently in danger
of disappearing altogether.
Representatives of the tuna in-
dustry, however, dispute the
environmentalists’ mortality
estimates. David Burney, the
U.S. Tuna Foundation’s gen-
eral counsel, testiﬁed before a
Senate committee last April
that ”no marine mammal pop-
ulation stock in the Eastern

tection Act, which applies to

use of purse seine nets and the
practice of setting on dolphins,
but requires that the nets be
specially rigged to reduce the
chances of dolphin capture.
Before hauling in a tuna catch,
U.S. ﬁshermen are also re-
quired to open their nets
slightly to allow dolphins to
escape. The dolphins do not
always swim free, though.
Strong currents can cause nets
to double over, trapping and
often drowning any dolphins

quota is currently 20,500 dol-

ﬂeets. But Greenpeace offi-
cials say these rules will be in-
sufficient in light of the new
evidence of depleted dolphin
populations.

Greenpeace and Earth Is-
land Institute have suggested
ways that consumers can exert
pressure on the international
tuna industry to adopt fishing
methods that don’t endanger
dolphins. For one, consumers
can limit their tuna purchases
to albacore (labeled as “white
meat" or "chunk white") tuna.
Albacore tuna do not school
under dolphins and are caught
with books and lines rather
than with purse seine nets. But
albacore is packed and sold by
the same companies that sell
yellowfin. Because of this,
supporters of Earth Island In-
stitute’s “Save the Dolphins
Project" urge people to refrain
from eating tuna altogether.
They also urge consumers
who are concerned about the
killing of dolphins to write
their Congressional delega-
tions, urging them to amend
the Marine Mammal Protec-
tion Act so it fulfills its original
intent of reducing dolphin kills
to “insignificant levels apv
proaching zero."

FPL’s meter readers '

By KEVIN ALLEN
Staff Writer

They wear high-top work boots, pack a
peppery canine repellent and now carry

But electric meter readers still do not
count dogs as their best friends.

And why should they? At best, encoun—

cations of about 400 dogs, Swinson

‘ the addresses of 2,300 more.

The program was so successful,
FPL officials decided to try it
statewide.

FPL’s Fort Lauderdale office,
which serves 138,000 customers,
has received 2,000 responses so far.

“We’ve gotten a lot of positive
feedback,” said David Pieroni,
head of the meter reader depart—

office. “We’ve gotten some pretty
strange things, too.”

The owner of Fido, Ralph and

like to hide in waiting when the me-

Even if some of the responses
sound a bit shaggy, FPL takes each
one seriously, Pieroni said. Meter
readers learn quickly to assume
nothing when it comes to dogs, he
said.

“I could always smell them even
if I couldn’t see them,” said Ralf
Meinzer, meter reading clerk in
FPL’s Fort Lauderdale office and a
former meter reader.

“It’s not a real big problem.”

Don’t let those 300—pound

rangers are now advising.

aggression” being spread around
Yosemite Park in ranger talks, park
brochures and signs ‘ [posted on
trails.

“With this kind of policy you
have a chance to scare the bear off
and keep all your food,” said Dick
Riegelhuth, chief of resources man-
agement for Yosemite National
Park. “But if the bear gets more
aggressive, move out of the way and
let them have all your food.”

Riegelhuth said rangers are
suggesting that campers do more

than bang on pots, jump around or
yell to frighten the bears.

“We’re trying to get peeple to
stand their ground a little bit
more,” Riegelhuth said. “These
bears hardly ever hurt anyone and
if they do it’s almost always an acci-
dent”

Park officials said the new ma—
cho policy is intended to wean bears
from human food and send them

back toward their traditional natu-‘

ral food, which consists largely of
nuts and berries.

 

 

“We think campers and hikers
can be a little more assertive in
keeping bears out of the campsite,”
said Jeff Keay, the park’s wildlife
biologist. “But once that bear has
his claws on your food, it’s too late.
Then he has possession. Walk
away.”

Keay also suggested that the
“mild aggression” policy be set
aside if the bear is accompanied by
cubs. They are different bears at

dated.

In this drought year, black
bears, (the only kind Yosemite Na-
tional Park has; Grizzlies in Califor-
nia were hunted to extinction long

ago) are bolder than usual about .

approaching campsites for food,

Keay said.

Last year, there were 4-80 “inci~
dents” involving bears in Yosemite,
meaning they caused property dam—
age or personal injury. The number
of incidents fluctuates according to
winter’s duration and the amount
of water available.

Most injuries were minor.‘

There is no record of anyone ever
being killed by a black bear in Y0-
semite National Park, officials said.

Problems with bears stealing
improperly stored food and break~
ing into cars for food have plagued
many national parks. In Yosemite,
the problems began years ago when
people were encouraged to become
spectators as the bears helped them-
selves to food from the garbage
dumps.

That policy has been halted.
Bear-proof dumps are now every
where. Many campsites have poles
to hang food on.

From 1975 to 1987, 79 bears had
to be killed because they became
chronic troublemakers, Keay said.
The population of Yosemite‘s bears,
estimated at between 100 and 500, is
considered stable.

“Sometimes they get real good
at stealing food and they get hooked
on it,” said Riegelhuth.

ANACLETO RAPPING / Los Angeles Tmes
' Hyperion sewage treatment plant workers called adoptedfox “Dozer,” after bulldozers that they believe claimed its home.-

Dens ofInequity

Plant Workers Want Foxes to Get a Fair Chance at Survival

 

 

 




By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer

he red fox was no more than 3 weeks

old when mechanics at the Hyperion

sewage treatment plant saw it

wandering on their property near El
Segundo. Itwas disoriented and so tiny that it
could barely open its eyes.

For nearly a week after that May day, the
fox, a female, lived in a cardboard box in the
Hyperion ocean-monitoring laboratory, amid
racks of test tubes and a crowd of biologists
who cooed at it and fed it every three hours
like doting new parents.

They named the fox “Dozer,” after the
bulldozers that they believe claimed its home.

Dozer now resides at the Los Angeles Zoo,
where she is growing up with two Labrador
retrievers that are used in educational shows,
as is the fox. Dozer is friendly and likes people',
said animal keeper Gail Laule, who noted that
“she would not have survived” had she not
been discovered.

Now, some employees at Hyperion are
worried about Dozer’s cousins—foxes that
have lived for years in the hillside shrubbery
on the-eastern edge of the 144—acre plant site.
The hills are being cleared to expand the
sewage plant, under orders from the US.
Environmental Protection Agency.

“It’s a shame,” said electrician Tony .
Okolski, who is among a group of employees
who leave food for the foxes. “Their life has
been disrupted to a point where a lot of the
dens are completely covered by '
bulldozers. . .There 18 no respect for
whatever is living in those bushes.”

Plant officials are concerned that the foxes’

. dens are being torn up, said Hyperion

spokeswoman MaryAnne Pierson. After
Okolski complained, she said, Hyperion
officials asked Los Angeles animal control
authorities to trap and relocate the animals.

The city did set up traps about a month ago,

but no foxes were caught and the effort was
abandoned after about two weeks, according

, to Louis Dedeaux, wildlife specialist for the

Los Angeles Animal Care and Control
Division. He said it may have failed because
the foxes were attracted to food set out by

call from Hyperion officials a week ago, after .

some workers spotted an adult fox and two
kits. “If they want to trap them, ” he said, “I’ 11

~ be happy to help them.”

But Dedeaux said any relocation program
would depend on the type of foxes trapped.
Dozeris a red fox, but officials believe that

there are also gray foxes in the Hyperion hills.

The gray fox is indigenous to Southern
California, while the red fox is not.

Groups of red foxes—which were
reportedly first brought to Los Angeles
County by fox hunters seeking their favorite '
variety of prey—periodically are spotted in
the area, including recent sightings at the
TOrrance Airport and nearby Madrona Marsh.

Wildlife specialists normally would release
gray foxes back into the wild, but would be
reluctant to do the same with the red variety

. because they sometimes drive away the

native grays.

If the foxes are red, Dedeaux said, he would
recommend they be donated to zoos.

Whatever they are, the Hyperion foxes
have been a fixture at the sewage plant at
least since Okolski began work there 14 years
ago. _ -
Okolski and others regularly leave pet food '
for the foxes; on occasion, he said, his wife
bakes them chicken to “give them a little
break.” And once, he and other Hyperion
employees collected money to take an injured
fox to a veterinarian.

But Okolski, 60, former owner of an
avocado grove, resists taking credit for
pressing authorities to look into the foxes’
plight. He says other employees have been
just as concerned but are reluctant to speak
out, fearing they would be branded as
troublemakers. He said he simply grew tired
of seeing nature destroyed 1n the name of
progress and profit.

Progress has “to take a little loss,” he said. ‘
“And you share it with God’s little creatures.”

 

 




SAN DIEGO UNION - July 24, 1988

Hundreds
join effort
to count
dolphins

By Steve LaRue
Staff Writer

A plane, two boats and about 300
onshore volunteers counted dolphins
along the 323-mile Southern Califor-
nia Coast yesterday in what its or-
ganizer called “the largest public-in-
volved research project ever at-
tempted in marine science.”

About 150 to 200 dolphins were

sighted, with 90 percent of them off
the shores of San Diego and Orange
counties, said Dennis Kelly, the or-
ganizer. Some 125 stations were
staffed from Point Conception to the
Mexican border.

Kelly, a marine biology professor
at Orange Coast College in Costa

Mesa, said the dolphins were sighted _

in pods of three to six all along the
coast, a finding that he termed “most
unusual.”

“As of right now, I have no expla-
nation for this,” he said.

and South Carlsbad State Beach, said
RH. Defran, director of the 41/z-year-
old Cetation Behavior Laboratory at .
San Diego State University.

“During the past year the number ,
of dolphins in the San Diego area has .
gone off the chart,” Defran said,
scaring from an average of eight to

15’ dolphins in this area from 1984
through 1987 to between 60 and 90

over the past 12 months. _
.“It appears that we have. a very
high calving rate. here, which cer—

tainly suggests that this is an area
where there are dolphin mothers and
their calves all the time”?
Kelly said 60 to 70 of the-adolphins
counted yesterday were sighted off
the San Diego coast.
A biological disaster in the Atlan-
tic Ocean last summer reminded ex-
. perts that the marine environment is
delicate and that the playful mam-
mals one day could vanish forever,
Kelly said. .

“The same exact species of dolphin
lives there and, starting last July,
they began dying by the hundreds,”
he said. “Almost the entire popula-
tion of coastal bottlenose dolphins
was wiped out from New Jersey to
Florida.”

Although dolphins are surviving “

here, experts say there are danger
signs and they warn that many of the
mammals could succumb in the fu-
ture — as they did last year along the
East Coast —— unless strict controls
prevent pollution buildups from
offshore oil rigs and sewage outlets.
Yesterday’s survey was a snapshot

of the dolphin population here and
“an attempt to get the public in-
volved and aware that the bottlenose
dolphins are our nearest marine
neighbors, and anything we do to the
oceans affects them,” said Kelly.

‘ The dolphins are the same squeak-
lng animals depicted in the “Flipper”
television show. Dolphins bear their

young live and are ranked with chim- _

panzees in intelligence. More than

their immune systems.
Dolphins at some point may be
vulnerable to toxins, such as the
. banned insecticide DDT and the out-
lawed family of chemicals called
PCBs, which adhere to sewage solids
- and are flushed into the ocean daily.
. “These animals carry in their bod-
ies the highest levels of DDT and

PCBs‘of any animals on Earth, and
that doesn’t bode well for them, but
we are making good strides in South-
ern California in cleaning up the.
coast environment,” Kelly said.

Coastal cities face increasing pres-
sure from the federal Environmental
Protection Agency to reduce levels
of toxin-laden solids in the treated
sewage they pump into the ocean.

Environmentalists also say dol-
phins could fall prey to pollutants if
drilling muds are allowed to be dis-
charged directly into the ocean from
offshore oil rigs. Such oil-well lubri-
cants can contain arsenic, heavy
metals and other toxins from deep in
the earth.

“If we muck around in these wa-
ters, we run the risk of removing the
habitat for these animals,” Defran
said.

Yesterday’s count was the latest
and largest volunteer tally since they
began last year,Kelly said.

Florida Wildlife Falling Prey
To Assorted Plastic Menaces

n Associated Press story from Se-

bastian Inlet tells of deadly plas-
tics. Endangered sea turtles and
vulnerable birds, which eat plastic or
become caught in it, die a slow, pain-
ful death. The toll: 1 million birds and
100,000 marine mammals and sea tur-
tles each year.

In Florida, fishing wire suspends
brown pelicans in the mangroves
where they are discovered, usually in
skeletal form. Fishing line also throt-
tled a 70-pound loggerhead turtle that
was found bound, flipper and neck.

Other plastics are equally lethal.
Sebastian Inlet State Park manager
Ron Johns calls the circles that hold
cans in six-packs “killing machines.”
Minnows nipping at the rings tempt
diving birds, which strike expecting a
beakful of minnows. They end up with
a neckful of noose.

What’s true for the East Coast of
Florida is, sadly, true for the West.
Plastic throwaways put wading birds
and marine mammals at risk in the
marshes, mangroves, and beaches of
the Gulf, according to Dennis Kellen-
berger, executive director of the
Clearwater Marine Science Center.

Three sea turtles are convalescing
at the center. They were injured when

fishing lines cut off the circulation in
their flippers. Manatees occasionally
become enmeshed in plastic crab-
traps. Pygmy sperm whales have been
known to beach after swallowing plas-
tic bags. Similarly, dolphins have a
way of swallowing “anything that’s
man-made that finds its way into their
environment,” Kellenberger says.

In addition to fishing line, ice bags
are a common agent of misery. Many
plastics enter the sea by falling off
boats, Kellenberger says. No doubt
some are given a heave.

Volunteers collected more than
three miles of fishing line along four
miles of beach near Sebastian Inlet,
where the Indian River lagoon meets
the Atlantic. Despite that shocking fig-
ure, “Florida coasts are cleaner than
many,” according to the Associated
Press. A year from now, Florida will
join 13 other states mandating re—
placement of the six-pack rings with
rings that will disintegrate in sunlight.

Until sea and shore are free of
plastics, one can only heed Kellenber-
ger’s advice: “Just do your part and
pick up the trash.” And pat yourself
on the back for making the world a
safer place for all God’s creatures.

Urban pig in a poke( y)
to re tire a t animal farm

By ANDREA PEYSER
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA -— An animal rights ac-
tivist stepped in Tuesday to guaran-
tee that Blackie, the pet pig serving

in your gro-
cer’s freezer.
Raini Se-
quoya, who
once proposed
the city build a
“retirement
home” for ag- .
in zoo ani- ' .
mgls, offered Blackle
to ball the 40~pound porker out of a
Sheriff’s Office impoundment lot
and move him to a farm in Lake-
land.

Blackie became a hog celebre
last week after he broke free from
the arms of his owner, David Allen
Brown, as police arrested Brown on
a charge of probation violation.
Blackie ran loose for three hours

 

around North MacDill Avenue be-
fore being iured into the arms of a
sheriff’s deputy holding a handful of
horse feed.

The pig’s future looked bleak
Saturday when Brown, an inmate in
the Hillsborough County jail, re-
ceived word that the animal would
be “terminated” if not claimed in
five days, said Brown’s mother, Do-
rothy. ‘

Brown will be in jail until Aug. 5,
when he faces a judge on a charge
of violating probation after a drunk-
en-driving conviction.

Sequoya arranged for Blackie to
live out his days in Lakeland at a
kind of animal oasis operated by a
member of National Animal Rights
Inc., of which Sequoya is president.
Other residents of the farm include
three burros, five San Clemente
goats, a dog and five cats.

The Sheriff’s Office agreed to
waive the impoundment fees -—— $20,
plus $5 for each day of incarcera-
tion —- for springing the swine, sher-
iff’s spokesman Jack Espinosa said.

attorney. Witnesses were called to testify
under oath. Each side was admonished against
further emotional outbursts.

The defendants, however, were not there.
They were caged at the East Valley Animal
Shelter.

Three pit bulls accused of attacking a
10-year-old Lake View Terrace boy in
January were the subjects of the hearing,
among the first to be held under a law passed
by the Los Angeles City Council a year ago.

The law, approved after a rash of pit bull
attacks in California, allows the city to
impound dogs that bite people and to destroy
the animals in the worst cases. It also permits
the city to impose restrictions on owners of

3 three years.

have been given a second chance. They were
told to install fences and warning signs,

obedience school. Owners who refuse can

“Criminals don't even do as much time as

on the 10-year-old boy.

, Now officials can impound a dog
immediately after an attack.

Rush said the decisions on
whether to hold a hearing—and to
destroy a dog—are based on
whether the attack was provoked,
the severity of the bite, the ani-
mal’s history, whether the dog was
permitted to run loose and “wheth-
er the dog can be effectively
trained to change its tempera-
merit."

“In all of the cases, severity is
there,” he added. “It isn’t just a
little nip.” .

Officials attempt to resolve bark-
ing-dog complaints before they
reach a hearing—ﬁrst sending the
pet owner a warning letter, then
asking for an informal meeting if
therejs another complaint.

The hearings, which have lasted
as long as 16 hours over two days,
are conducted at an animal shelter

Although records of dog bites
show that no single breed attacks
more than others, many of the
cases have involved pit bulls,
which are known for their power-

' when they bite. 3

Garcia, whose three pit bulls are

; accused of attacking the 10~year-
old and who has spent close to
‘ $4,000 in legal fees defending the

dogs, contends that her pets are
victims of “pit bull hysteria.”
“My dogs are very lovable ani-

k‘ mals,” she said, saying that she has

cared for children in her home with
; the dogs present.

Attacked as He Played

Animal control officers say 10—
year-old Michael Degraphenreed
Jr. was attacked as he was climbing
a rope in front of his home. The pit
bulls bounded out of Garcia’s yard
next door and charged toward him.
The boy scurried up the rope, but
one of the dogs leaped into the air
and locked its jaws on the boy’s
buttocks, officers say, causing a
wound that required 30 stitches.

After eight hours, hearing exam -
iner James Connelly recommended
that the pit bulls be ordered out of
ithe city and that the Garcias be
prohibited from owning dogs for
three years.

“I personally observed these
dogs on several occasions during

“I would not do this study, I would not

Gormus and his research are trapped
in a fight between competing interests. _

stopping a horrible disease that still ravag-

es the Third World. On the other: the mom;

For more than 100 years, since
discovery of the bacterium that
causes leprosy, researchers have
sought a primate model for vaccine
studies.

NIH supported Gormus’ re-
search when he discovered that elu-
sive model in the sooty mangabey,
at a cost of $628,000. It is the only
non-human primate that contracts
leprosy naturally. Others are not
susceptible to the disease.

j “The beauty of his work and the
reason it’s been funded is that he
has developed the only primate
model for leprosy vaccines,” said
Dr. Patrick Brennan of Colorado
Springs, Colo., a nationally respect-
ed expert on leprosy and a member
of the NIH reviﬁw panel that ap-
proved Gormus’ la‘test grant.

1“Leprosy is an enormous disease
in some parts of the world -~ a ter-
rible problem in India, a very seri-
ous problem in the tropical zone.
It’s very sad.

“This kind of testing hasn’t been
possible before,” Brennan said.

d“We felt the pros far outweighed
the cons.”

‘The US. Fish and Wildlife Ser-
vice of the Interior Department is
not so sure. Its job is to preserve
species in danger of extinction, not
to allow them to be subjected to
dread disease.

.,The bureaucracy has debated
for.nearly two years whether to al-

mangabeys. He will lose the grant it

and Wildlife. “Obviously, what they
want to use the animals for is a
worthwhile thing that would benefit
Nobody’s against
benefiting human health But this
office has to enforce what’s on the
list.”

The Endangered Species Act in-V

cludes the sooty mangabey as a sub-
species of the endangered
white-collared mangabey. Gormus
sides with taxonomists who classify
the sooty mangabey as a separate
species from the white-collared.~

He and others contend that the"

sooty mangabey is actually plentiful
in West Africa.

. , Gormus, 46, is an animal lover
with 10 cats at home. He frequently
buys bananas for the mangabeys ~—
16 pounds at once — and readily
will go to two supermarkets if the

‘ first store’s bananas are too green.

His plan is to inoculate the wild
mangabeys with vaccines already
being tried on humans in Venezuela
and then to challenge the vaccines
by injecting‘the animals with mas
sive doses of live leprosy bacteria.
He hopes to discover an effective
vaccine in three or four years.

That is a fraction of the time re-
quired for human vaccine trials.

Humans are never intentionally
subjected to leprosy. Using a type of
virus similar to the human-leprosy
virus, researchers vaccinate people
and then follow them for 20 or 30

« years to see if they develop the dis-

ease. They are then tested every
few years since it takes a long time
to determine if the vaccination is
effective.

Leprosy rarely kills its victims
and is not painful, Gormus main-

tained. Any mangabeys that became '

infected would be treated.

Under the law, an endangered
species can be taken from the wild
only to enhance propagation and
survival of the species. Zoos, for ex-

ample, receive permits to breed

rare animals in captivity.
Gormus is one of the first scien-

tists to be caught by the dilemma of ‘

not be the last. AIDS researchers
want ‘to import chimpanzees for
AIDS vaccine studies.

“This is one of the first cases
where endangered species legisla-
tion has come into sharp focus on
what it might cost in human lives,”
said Dr. Dennis Johnsen, director
the National Institutes of Health re-
gional primate centers program.

The Humane Society of the Unit-
ed States has petitioned Fish and
Wildlife to upgrade the chimpan-
zee’s status from threatened to en-
dangered. A spokesman for People
for the Ethical Treatment of Ani-
mals said flatly, “We're against the
use of any primates in research.”

To try to resolve the Gormus-
permit question, Fish and Wildlife is

negotiating with NIH on what NIH ,
. could do to enhance the mangabeys’

survival. .

NIH has agreed to breed the
mangabeys before the vaccine trials
begin and has said it would like to
conduct a census of the animals in
the wild along with, one of chimpan-

zees that is in the planning stages.

“We need something more defi-
nite,” said Marshall Jones, director
of the Office of Mangement Authori-
ty at Fish and Wildlife.

“The work Dr. Gormus is doing
has very important implications for
people around the world,” said .
Johnsen of NIH. “It’s really a darn
shame he’s being stymied.”

,bond issue.

A Philadelphia firm designed the
primate exhibit and 3 Berkeley,
Calif, firm did the tropical rain
forest. Freiheit said in-state com-
*-panies would handle most other
phases of construction.

The “Primate Panorama” would .
be constructed adjacent to the cur- '
rent primate exhibit on the 200’s ‘
western edge and include 21 spe-
cies ranging from dwarf mouse le-
murs to lowland gorillas. By elimi-
nating the sterile enclosures that
housed the animals in the past and
facilitating normal social interac-
tion, zoo officials hope to enhance
breeding potential.

“Nobody has tried to do a whole
range like this,” said Gary Lee,
one of the principal designers of
the primate project. “If it’s com-
pleted, it will be one of the world’s
best in terms of the range of pri-
mates.”

The “Tropical Discovery” exhib-
it would feature 12 diverse habitats
—'- everything from mountain cave
to jungle ruins to coral reef —and
dozens of animal varieties includ-
ing tr0pical butterflies, vampire
bats, clouded leopards, piranhas
and venomous snakes.

“We felt the need to exhibit
smaller creatures like reptiles, in-
vertebrates, insects, fishes, spiders
and scorpions,” said Freiheit.
“This was in direct response to vis-

, itor inquiries. The first most-asked
. question we get is, ‘Where are the
. bathrooms?’ The second is, ‘Where
are the snakes?’ ”
i The tropical exhibit, planned for
the eastern end of the zoo complex,
9 would be linked to the current
“Northern Shores” display by a
mountain stream habitat featuring
r ‘a. trout pool and a prairie marsh
3- exhibit that would include fish,
i. frogs and waterfowl.
LE. “In addition to showing the zoo
visitor all these exotic animals in .
tropical habitats,” said Freiheit,
“there’s a strong conservation

’ “An acre of tropical habitat dis-
’11,; appears from the planet every sec-

day’s society is the education of

servation issues. ‘Tropical Discov-

Shuttle eases pa

By Kevin Simpson
Denver Post Staff Writer
wLongstanding parking problems
at the Denver Zoo and the Natural
History Museum may have moved
a step closer to resolution with the
start of a free shuttle service that
transports visitors from a remote
parking lot during peak times.

. The system, which began opera-

. tion Saturday, offers 375 parking

spaces in the National Jewish re-
‘ ' iratory center’s lighted security
Iot at the corner of East Colfax Av-

. genue and Colorado Boulevard.

AUCars must enter' from Albion

Street, one block east of Colorado.
Dn Saturdays, Sundays and holi:
gays through Labor Day, shuttles

- will operate three times per hour

from 9 am. to 6 pm.

The ride takes about three min
utes and stops at the entrance ts
both the zoo and the museum. A1~
though the shuttle isn’t equipped to

, handle disabled passengers, handi~

capped parking spaces "are avail-
able close to the entrances of both
facilities.

“We’re hoping this is the answer
to the parking problems,” said zoo
director Clayton Freiheit. “This
way, we take no green space from
City Park.”

LOUIS POST- D ISPATCH

 

For The Animals, 11’s Multrplzcemgn

_ By Victor Voiland
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

The stork may be the busiest ani-
mal at the St. Louis 200, where
births have been burgeoning this
spring and summer.

The newborns range from a litter
of eight Vietnamese pot- -bellied pigs
- squealing and squiggling Satur-
day to get at their mother’s mill; at
the Children’s Zoo — to a heftier
female Nile hippopotamus born
June 17 in the hippos’ outdoor pool
and a male tapir delivered June 11
to a pair also born at the Zoo._

7 The St- Louis Zoo is one of the
few to manage a second-generation
birth of a tapir, an endangered spe-
cies of hoofed, hoglike mammal
that resemwa an anteater with its
long, ﬂexible snout.

Ingrid Porton, director of the
Children’s Zoo, said that March to

, October was a busy time at the Zoo,

with most of the births purposely
arranged for May and June sp that
the animals can be born outside
and have enough time to be
weaned and become independent
before winter sets in. '

, “Yes, we have planned parent-
hood here at the Zoo,” Porton said.

The St. Louis Zoo propagates ani:
mals to sell and trade to other zoos
to fill out their collections. Some

are kept to replace animals that

 

have died or stopped reproducing.
Trades are made to get a more var-
iegated genetic input in a zoo ’s own
collection, Porton said.

Elephants and primates are the
only 200 animals that form lifelong

family attachments, she said. Oth-‘-
ers generally go their own way af-

ter being weaned.

The Zoo’s hoofed stock, known as
ungulates, have been especially
prolific this year. The offspring
include:

I A male addax, a desert-dwell-
ing antelopefrom.North Africa.

I A female lesser kudu, a deli-
cate, forest-dwelling antelope from
Africa.

I A male gerenuk, a small East
African antelope.

I Four Springbok antelopes,
whose natural habitat is South
Africa.

I Two sibling female impala,
which are the subject of 3 Zoo
study on ungulates raised in
captivity.

I A friendly, 2- month-old llama
named P. J. that is the hit of classes
at the Children’s Zoo.

Colleen Kelly, head keeper of the
ungulates, said she was completing
a study of behavioral difference be-

tween impala that are bottle-fed '7

and those that are nursed by their

July 18, 1988

mother.

Patsy, an impala born at the be-
ginning of last month and trained ta
answer a whistle for her bottle, has
adjusted well to the herd and al-
ready exhibits more adult charac-
teristics than juvenile, Kelly said.

Her younger sister, sired by the
same buck and born of a different
mother at the beginning of this
month, has already caught up in
size because of the advantages of
mother’ 5 milk, she added.

Kelly has a special fondness for
her- new trio of Bactrian camels,
which. are a two-humped species

from Mongolia and Afghanistan.__

The male and two females weighed
about 100 pounds each when they

'were born in April, May andlast

month and are beginning to fill out
their humps, which we're empty
flaps on their backs at birth. _

Porton’s pet is Mshindi, a great
ape born in October but still in dia-
pers in his large display area in the
Children’s Zoo He commutes daily
with Porton to the new Jungle of
the Apes to be with his parents and
learn how. to be a great ape.

His name, which is African for
“winner,” originated in happier
times,
winners in the National League,
Porton said.-

PRESS RELEASE of the week:

“State Senator Dan McCorquodale,
D-San Jose, Chair of the Senate Natural
Resources Committee will be holding a
public hearing looking into the alleged
mistreatment of an elephant at San Die

' go Wild Animal Park.

“The hearing will be on July 29,
from 9:30 am. to 4:30 p.m., in the Mitch-
ell Room of the Escondido City Hall, 201
North Broadway Escondido.

“According to McCorquodale, the ..
hearing is in response to a June 30 deci-l ,

sion by San Diego's City Attorney to not
prosecute animal handlers accused of
brutalizing ‘Dunda,’ a popular female
African elephant.” X

byist in Sacramento for a long time, but
this vear he’s got a personal stake in a

bill.

Silverbrand, who represents a

handful of Southern California school

districts, says he is acting “in memory of
our cock-a-poo, Charlie, who died in the
jaws of Ajax, a pit bull on January 15.”

Silverbrand is trying to defeat a bill
by Senator Art Torres, DLos Angeles,
that was supposed to deal with the
threat of pit bulls. But Silverbrand says-
the bill wouldn’t be as strict as many
existing city dog regulations.

The bill has been weakened
through a series of amendments. Insid-
ers say the changes were the work of
Gladys Sargent, a wealthy octogenarian
pet lover who has the ear of Senate
President David Roberti, D—Los Angeles.

When it was introduced, the bill
was aimed at regulating pit bulls and
their owners. It since has been mongrel-
ized to regulate all breeds.

Critics say the weakness in the bill
stems from the long periods of time in
which a dog could kill or injure a person
or another dog before it could be declar-
ed legally “vicious.”

Owners of vicious dogs would have
to keep them confined, post warning
signs and carry $100,000 or liability in-
surance against the attacks.

A hearing is scheduled for August 3
in the Assembly Water, Parks and Wild
life Committee, which stalled the moa- '
sure last month.

“I lost my dog,” said Silverbrand,
“and that's why I’m in this.”

Pet Ferret Ex ii
Wife MGy

By Sharon McCormick
Chronicle East Bay Bureau

A Newark man claimed yes-
terday that his distraught wife
has threatened to leave him for
a jetsetting ferret because his
illegal weasel was apprehended
by police and banished to Colo-
rado. ’

“My wife is so upset by this
she‘s blaming me for the officers
taking Bandy away,” said Mack
Watson, 41, owner of the tile-year-
old ferret that he says was like a
"daughter" to his wife, Margaret

Bandy was taken by an animal
control officer Wednesday after she
was spotted nose to the wind draped
over Watson’s shoulders as he was
driving to the grocery store.

“I knew it was a ferret, and l
was pretty sure it was illegal to own
one,” said Mike Pulliam, the New-
ark police detective who spotted the
animal and recognized its owner
from some minor incidents involvo
ing police.

Pulliam notified animal control
officers and accompanied them to
‘ Watson ‘3 home, where they prompt-

ly whisked the slinky creature
away.

. "She’s never spent a day of her
life caged up like that,” said Wat-

son, who paid $280 to free his pam~
pered pet, which sports a $21,le
jewel-studded collar and dines on
cantaloupe and whipping cream.

, After her release, Bandy was
shipped out in the cargo hold of a
United Airlines flight to a crime-
free life in Colorado, one of 46 states.
where ferrets can be kept legally as
pets.

The flight was not the ferret’s

first. Watson said Bandy has surrep~ '

The agile animal is banned ll.
California because, authorities say.
it can prey on small animals and

Watson said he and his wife
treated their ferret as a member of
the family.

“She‘s not a killer animal like
everyone says,” Watson said. “She
sleeps with us, she uses a litter box.
and she loves to ride in the car with
her paws on the window and her
head facing into the wind.

“But now my wife says she’s

it.

Cats were never a problem when I lived
alone. But then I st arted dating a girl ‘who had
two cats. I married her. N ow l have two cats.

Living u ith Louis and Daphne, my feelings
grew stronger. My couch disintegrated. The
kitchen sli‘mllcd likeNine Lives Beef & Egg Din-
ner. Furhalls clung to my \\-’l1eaties. The only
baseball trophy i ever Willi “loll” Off a shelf and
broke.

“It 's male rivalry," my wife said.

“But he‘s a cat." I replied.

No. my wife insisted. I was theoddity. All her
old lmyi‘riomls had loved Louis, potted him, roll~

Furbolls clung
to my Wheaties

 

ed up little pa per balls and thrown them, and
cute, adorable Louis would fetch them.

But the truth dim nod on mo one evening at a
.g,part3.' on Capitol Hill. The watershed evening.

,1 §§Ihe evening when Iknew I had to write the book.

1
t

I ran into one of the old boyfriends by the ' ‘
bar. He sneered, familiar hatred dripping from

his voice, “Does she still have Louis?”

At that moment the blinders were ripped
from my eyes. I saw that thousands of boyfriends

through the ages had shared my. feelings. We’d

been bamboozled. Tricked.

So I wrote a cat book. That’s right. One of
those paperback cat books you see on counters in
bookstores. One of those cutesy gift books serious
writers always complain suck up the resources of
their publishers. - -

I took five quick days and jotted down my

 

 

fantasies about killing Louis. Chucklingwmmadly.

. like do Sade, I dreamed up more and more ways

to end the miserable creature’s existence. Quickv
sand kitty litter. Electric scratch posts.

I imagined more great men of history and
how they had escaped detection. I called all the
victims in the book; Louis.

Iadvised how to fool your girlfriend into
thinking you loved her eat, so she wouldn’t sus-
pect you later. I gave tips on body disposal.

It-was all a lark. Something to do. I didn’t real-
ly think anyone would buy the book. But my
agent laughed when I showed it to her. And she
sent it out.

Doubleday bought it.

In September, “How to Kill Your Girlfriend’s
Catt” is going to be published. Or actually, launcl»
e .

‘ “We’re bringing out 100,000 copies," my ediv‘
tor gushed over the phone. “We’ll have counter
displays. We’ll hand out, ‘How to 'Kill Your Girl- .
friend’s Cat’ postcards at the ABA. We’re print-r
ing up promotional booklets for stores. You have
to come to the office and meet the president.
She’s a big fan.” , ,_

Maybe at this point you’re entrisionmg a nap
)y ending to this story. Perhaps you see me, It.
Robert Daphne, basking in the Riviera sun, It‘-
ving Wallace style. -

Perhaps you imagine me saunterlng into the ‘ ‘
casino, tossing a $1,000 chip onto the table, laugh—
ing delightfully when I lose. “It‘s only money." So
far this looks like a success story. The American
dream. Not to mention the death of Louis.

Sorry.
Louis gets revenge.

Because now I have to make a second confes-
sion. Dr. Robert Daphne isn’t my real name. It’s a
pseudonym for the cat book. It’s my feline nom
de plume. Under my real name I just finished a
serious book, “Saltmaker,” a novel about a presi-
dent tried for treason for refusing to use nuclear
weapons. A novel I sweated over. A novel I stayed
up nights writing. A novel I dreamed would lift ’
me into the ranks of respected American writers. ,
I wrestled with that novel for three years. not
five days.

,The novel is coming cut this summer, too.

Is the novel getting the kind of attention the
cat book is?

Noooooooooo.

“The response to the cat book is unprecedento
ed,” my Doubleday editor bubbled on the phone
yesterday..“We got an order for 13,000 books just
from Waldenbooks! This is going to be a hit.”

“How many copies of your novel Will be in
stores nationwide?” my Viking editor said.
“About 13,000.” .

Asked Doubleday, “Will you be willing to go
on television to promote the cat book?” I said yes,
but only if I wore a paper bag Over my head, like .
men on David Susskind. It was important to keep
the two books separate, in case the TV peOple
wanted me for the novel. too.

Viking told me it’s hard to get novelists on.

Recently, my wife and I went to an Esquire
magazine party, where I was introduced to some
of the magazine’s top columnists. We were in a
huge remodeled Manhattan ballroom. A live jazz
band was playing, and trays of delicious hors

Cat, " my agent said.

I can't go on like this. Calendar companies are
calling. British publishers have inquired about
foreign rights. Editors from magazines call to say
how funny the cat book is. At a recent party in
Manhattan, i started talking to a well-known
agent. He asked me what I was working on. I
went on at length about the novel, the philosophi-
cal questions it posed, nuclear issues, legal ones.

“The president got on the hotline,” I told the.
agent passionately. “He told the Soviet premier
we wouldn’t fight, even though their attack was
in progress. Thirty seconds later, it turned out
the whole alert was false. So, was the president’s
refusal to use nuclear weapons cowardice or
bravery. patriotism or treason?”

The agent sipped his vodka and gazed out at
the Hudson. He heard this kind of conversation.
from writers 10 times a day.

In fact. 1 completely forgot about the cat.
book. But when I remembered, five minutes lat.

have something else coming out. A little pam-

Nigerian Gorillas, Believed Extinct, Emerge

By JAMES BROOKE
Special to The New York Times

KANYANG, Nigeria —— For years,
the outside world thought that gorillas
were extinct here. But Jacob Osang
and Napoleon Mkpe knew better, and
whenever they spied an adult gorilla in
the thick rain forest here they saw $200
worth of walking restaurant meat.

Expert trackers, the two hunters
long ago recouped their investment in a
crude shotgun, its barrel fashioned
from the steering column of a Land-
Rover. ’

In the early 1980’s a new paved road
was pushed past the edge of this re-
mote village of thatched huts and cas-
sava fields, opening an edge of the
hunters’ terrain to others’ eyes. Soon,
rumors reached the outside world that
gorillas survive in the steep mountains
here —-— 30 years after they were
thought extinct in Nigeria, black Af-
rica’s most populous and most induso
trializedcountry.

 

Four Bands Are Found

But scientists warn that the “redisw
covery” of the gorillas may only have
come in time to witness their destruc-

tion.
Last April, an international survey

team published the findings of a two-
month search. Four bands of lowland
gorillas, totaling about 150, are making
a last stand in the mountain rain forest
here — the last stretch of untouched
primary rain forest in this nation of 107
million people. The gorillas here are

and Gabon, while a islightly different

, subspecies, called the mountain gorilla,

occurs in Zaire, Rwanda and Uganda.
“Without doubt, the gorillas are

under intense pressure from hunting,”

wrote the authors, Sandy Harcourt, a

, Briton, Ibrahim lnahoro, a Nigerian,

and Kelly Stewart, an American, refer-
ring to the gorillas in Nigeria. “We cal-
culate that perhaps twice as many are
killed each year as are born.”

Indeed, on each side of the new road
here, wide spans of land have been

. cleared of rain forest. Cultivation of ba-

nanas, cassavas and oil palms now
reaches up the lower flanks of the goril—
las’ mountain refuges.

New Approach Wins Converts

Desire for development is great in
Kanyang, one of three villages that
claim ownership to the gorillas’ rain
forest retreat. Kanyang is a village of
smoke fires and naked babies, a village
where the main dirt path more often

. bears the prints of rubber sandals than

the tracks of rubber tires. The rhythm

. of daily life is set by the steady thump-

ing of women pounding cassava roots
in wooden mortars.

But in recent months a new approach
to development has won converts
among the 700 Boki tribespeople living
here.

“We want people to come here to
look at the gorillas,” said Mr. Mkpe,
whose face had lit up at the arrival of
visitors who drove the 10 hours from
Lagos, the nation’s capital, to this ham—
let, which figures on few road maps.

Last year the Nigerian Conservation
Foundation proposed to villagers that
the gorillas could be more valuable as
tourist attractions in the wild than as
steak fillets on restaurant tables. The
foundation, a private group, paid for
this year’s gorilla search.

The High Price of Bush Meat

In Nigeria, wild game, known as bush
meat, fetches higher prices than meat
from domesticated animals. For many
young men here, hunting gorillas, duik-
ers and mandrills represents their sole
source of cash income.

Last August the young men of Ka-

nyang met one Sunday morning at

their traditional hilltop rendezvous. By
the end of the day they had adopted an

, experimental hunting ban.

“The village itself voluntarily
banned hunting,” said Lee J. T. White,
a British zoologist who serves as a con-
sultant to the Conservation Founda-
tion. “The young men hope to earn
money as guides and porters.”

To enforce the ban, the Conservation
Foundation hired as wardens the
town’s two most skillful trackers —
Mr. Osang and Mr. Mkpe.

To date, they have caught four

' poachers, including one prominent vii-

lage elder. The poachers lost their guns

__ and were fined the eQuivalent of $15.

The New York Times/Aug. l, 1988
Discovery of gorillas around Ka-
nyang may not have come in time
to avert their destruction.

 

 

 

In the meantime, the trackers say
their new role‘has given them a new
perspective on the gorillas.

“We like to watch the gorillas feed:
ing in the trees,” Mr. Mkpe, a wiry 28-
year—old, recounted recently as village
elders gathered to listen to his moun-
tain tales. “Sometimes they pluck the
fruit from a tree. Or the mother gives
her breast to her baby.” _

“Really, there is no difference be-
tween gorillas and human beings —
they just can’t talk,” he concluded.

So far, one other village, Bamba, has
also instituted a hunting ban. In July,
tourism officials visited the area. This
year, federal officials are to consider a
proposal to make the gorilla refuge a
300-square-mile national park.

 

The impulse to protect Nigeria’s go-
rillas reflects a new interest here in
conservation — a concern more often
associated with East Africa. The Con-
servation Foundation, which became
active two years ago, recently began a
$500,000 drive to raise money for con-
servation activities in five Nigerian
game parks and reserves.

“In the past two or three years there
has been a 100 percent increase in wild-‘
life conservation in Nigeria,” said John
Oates, an American zoologist who has
studied primates in Nigeria since 1967.

“Because Nigeria is such a leader in
Africa and because its environment
has become so much abused, it will be
encouraging for the continent if they
can save the gorillas,” continued the
zoologist, who teaches anthropology at
Hunter College in New York.

In Kanyang, Mr. Osang, a physically
trim 26-year-old who nimbly and noise-
lessly climbs up and down the steep
mountain inclines, believes it will be a .
few years before the gorillas will toler-
ate the presence of panting and gasp-
ing tourists.

“But the gorillas don’t hear gunshots
in the mountains as before,” the for:
mer hunter mused. “So they must won;
der what is happening.” as:

R. MICHAEL W. Fox, ' of the Wolf Sanctuary in west St. Louis

veterinarian by trade, was . COUBIY-
looking more rock starish than ~
animal rights activist as he sat poolside
at the Chase Hotel last month wearing an
unconstructed, nobby blazer and
wraparound shades.

It had been one of those wild and
'crazy weeks, Fox said, packed with
speaking engagements, at least one of
which managed to offend some
members of the American Primatology
Association the day before at a
workshop in New Orleans. Fox
explained that these were scientists who
study primates housed in undesirable
laboratory conditions such as small
cages. They attended the workshop to
learn how to deal with the psychological
needs of these animals, an area in which
Fox has great expertise.

“I suggested to them that the only
reason we experiment on animals,
particularly non-human primates, is
because we feel superior,” said Fox, 50,
his faintly British accent drawing on
superior. “This is illusionary because we
are all a part of one life, of one creation.
No amount of animal research is going
to cure the fundamental disease that I
call a dualistic world view.

“The problem is that we see
ourselves separate from nature,
separate from the rest of creation, and
we have to get back to feeling, to living,
as part of the one life."

Fox maintains there is an incredible
amount or repressed guilt among
scientists who “make healthy animals
suffer in order to alleviate our own
suffering.” Apparently this assertion did
not go over real well among the
primatologists, some of whom found
Fox’s espousals at the very least
controversial it not downright insulting.

Indeed, Fox has a lot to say. In an
hour-long interview the morning of the
Saturday he was to speak at a benefit for
the Wolf Sanctuary, he discussed a wide
range of topics, including the fate of the '
American farm, the “holocaust” of the
animal kingdom and changes in St. Louis . . .. . 4

“We are all a part of one life, of one creation,” Fox says.

 

 

 

 

 




tree or earth. Nobody can tell you.
You ’ve got to see! it gnome! .”

Empathy is a favorite term of Fox's.
He strongly believes that unless humans
can feel empathy with animals, nature . -
and other living things, they will
continue to destroy themselves and their
environment. He subscribes to a
doctrine that he calls “panantheism,” not
pantheism, meaning, in effect, that all is
in God and God is in all.

“Essentially, we’re talking about the
unity of all life," he said. “We all come
from the same origins. Only when we
have a deep empathy is it emotionally
impossible to experiment on animals.
What we need to go about in a spiritual
sense is the (resacrament) of the
creation.”

In his capacity as a Vice president
at the US. Humane Society, Fox has
made some inroads in enCouraging
farmers to practice, and consumers to
demand, organically grown produce and

' more humanely raised livestock.

“We’re exploring a program with the
Organic Farm Producers Association
where no chemicals would be used on
creps,” he said. “We’re hoping to
develop an approved label with the
USDA (United States Dairy Association)
to indicate humanly raised (products).
The intention is to feed farm animals
organic produce so that they are
healthier. We’re talking about producing
food that is more ecologically sound,
healthful and less harmful to wildlife.”

~Fox maintains that the cost of such a
program should not be an issue. “Food is
a fundamental, period. There is a
certain professional pride for the
farmers involved. Those who want to get
away from the factory farming chemical
treadmill should be provided with

federal and state support.”

As the conversation turns to farming,
Fox’s tone borders on the passionate.
Clearly, the future of the American farm
is a subject to which he has given a lot of
thought, and still another subject to
which he offers a strong opinion.

“The only way to save the family
farm is to decentralize agriculture. One
time in America 20 percent of our land
went to farming. Now it’s 2 percent. Soon
we’ll have 5,000 super farms raising
most of the world’s food. '

“We need to think about bioregional
production where we have more farm
cooperatives, farmers markets and the
like. Supermarkets in certain parts of
the country are beginning to develop
organic sections. If farmers continue to
increase their volume of organic crops
and consumers continue to demand this,
then the price will go down. It’s up to
middle-class people who can afford this
alternative to support it. It’s a moral
imperative.”

Moving from taming to genetic
engineering, Fox volunteered that he is
working on a book on that subject, which

he hopes to complete by next spring. The

, title alone -—- “Silent World: Genetic
*- £ngineering: Nature’s End?” —— suggests
1 that Fox is still pondering.

 

On one hand, he voices SkeptiCbiii i.-

r the idea of gene splicing to try to make

significantiy more heaithf; iiyestock. On

the other, he sees the positives of genetic
* engineering as it pertains to using
bacteria to synthesize new biological
products and develop new drugs.

“Genetic engineering could be used to
heal ourselves and our relationship with
the planet if it is applied with right

attitude,” he said. “But now that we have .

power over genes of life, like any
technology with the wrong attitude it will
backfire and we’ll have some serious

problems.”

Despite his other interests and

achievements, Fox remains devoted
to understanding animals and their

. psychological needs. In addition to
his column, his two best sellers,
“Understanding Your Dog” and
“Understanding Your Cat,” have
been reprinted numerous times and
sold more than a million copies.

Fox is pleased that most veteri-
nary schools now mandate a course
in animal psychology. Back in his
day, such an offering was unheard
of.

"The idea that animals had any
kind of emotional problems was al—
most a sort of heresy then,” he said.
He notes that the American Veteri-
narian Association is setting up cri—
teria to regulate the field so that
people will not be able to pass them ~
selves off as trained animai thera'
pists without having the proper
credentiais.

“As veterinarians, we accept that
an animal’s body may suffer. Why
did it take so long to understand that
their minds may suffer as welt?

“For truly if you don’t understand
animals’ emotions and intentions
then you can’t really relate to them
and know such things as when
they’re well or sick. You have to
have a deep empathy. If you don’t
have that, then you don’t have good
animal husbandry or good animal
care.”

Toxic FarmRunoff
Perils Wildlife Area

By LARRY B. STAMMER, Times Staff Writer

Agricultural drain water from large—scale farming near Fallon,
Nev., is so toxic that it kills both freshwater fish and invertebrates
commonly found in the nearby Stillwater Wildlife Management
Area, a preliminary US. Fish and Wildlife Service study has found.

The finding was widely viewed Friday as an early signal that the
ecological health of the 164,000-acre wildlife refuge 60 miles east of
Reno could be in jeOpardy. Stillwater is one of only eight
shore- bird reserves in the Western Hemisphere and is a major
nesting area and migratory stop.

Since 1987, the refuge’ s ponds and lakes have been fed
exclusively by agricultural drain water. Up until then, the refuge
received what amounted to surplus fresh water from both the
Carson and Truckee rivers that bypassed 65,000 acres of nearby
farmlands

River Water Diverted

But when growers complied with requests to get by with less
water, they used the water more efficiently and in effect left no
spillover of fresh water for the refuge. In addition, the US. Bureau
of Reclamation diverted more water from the Truckee River to
Pyramid Lake to save the endangered Quiui fish, which is found
only in that lake.

Beginning in late 1986, more than 1,500 birds and upwards of 7
million fish died in the Carson Sink, the terminus of water in the
Stillwater refuge. The deaths attracted national attention. At the
time, avian cholera was confirmed as the cause of deaths of some of
the birds.

But scientists speculated at the time that many of the deaths
could be attributed to elevated levels of selenium or mercury in the
water. Such substances, which occur naturally in the soil, can
become highly concentrated in the drain water that runs into the
refuge.

Last May, samples of water were taken from the Stillwater
refuge’s Pintail Bay, upstream from the Carson Sink. Samples from ‘
the bay, which has since gone dry, were sent to the U. S. Fish and i

. Wildlife Service laboratories in Columbia, Mo.

‘Acutely Toxic’

Fisheries biologist Christopher Ingersoll, author of the study,
said in a telephone interview Friday that the agricultural drains:
water taken from Pintail Bay was “acutely toxic to both freshwater j
and saltwater fish and invertebrates. ”

He said that elevated levels of boron, chromium, copper, zinc,
_ cadmium, arsenic and lead were detected. “While no element was ,

HARROWSMITH-July/August 1988

GUARD DONKEYS

As sheep farmers in Ontario, we
know firsthand about the maulings and
deaths behind the phrase “predator
losses," but for the past three years, our
flock has had none, although a nearby
flock continues to lose lambs and ewes
to dogs, wolves and coyotes. Our suc-
cess, which is shared by sheep ranchers
in the United States and Australia, is due
to our predator-control animals: don-
keys. Our donkeys live with the sheep
all year long, sharing their summer pas-
ture and winter hay ration.

Donkeys are often portrayed as being
temperamental and stubborn, but ours
are docile and dependable. (They are
broken to ride and drive, and are good
around both sheep and children. Our

four-year-old rides his jenny -a female '

donkey — without special supervision.)
If a predator enters the ﬁeld, though, the
donkeys sound the alarm and go after it
with amazing speed. They rise up on
their hind feet, striking at the intruder
with both front feet,.braying loudly all
the while. ,

Our donkeys are scoffed at by some
farmers, but the offspring of our females

are now protecting several other On-
tario ﬂocks. Like guard dogs, they must
be raised with the sheep to be effective,
but unlike guard dogs, they can be con-_
ﬁned in the ﬁeld by a fence and they are
more likely to feel part of the ﬂock they
are protecting because they eat and
sleep with the sheep.

John Conter, secretary of the'Ameri-
can Council of Spotted Asses, raises
guard donkeys in Billings, Montana. He
warns that not all donkeys will guard

sheep. Yet of the 24 spotted asses Conter .

has sold, only one has been returned be-
cause it antagonized sheep.

Conter recommends that only one
guard donkey be assigned to a single
pasture - even if the pasture is hundreds
of acres in size -— since even donkeys that

are gentle with sheep may kick and bite
each other. Jennies are best, he says, be-

. cause they are instinctively more protec-

tive than jacks - male donkeys.

BAHIA BEACH -— The pair of
dolphins scooted just below the
bay’s surface, breaking the blue
sheen only to breathe. They de-
scended and rose in a natural
' rhythm, their dorsal fins splitting
the water.

The playful dolphins were can
tured in the shallows of the Bay
near Picnic Island and Port.Mana-
tee and were ﬂown early Tuesday
from Orlando to the University of
California at Santa Cruz.

But researchers say that unlike
the case in the majority of national
dolphin study programs, these crea-
tures will not live out their lives in a
fish tank. And they won’t be bribed
into doing tricks pioneered by that
former TV star, Flipper

“These guys will get to come
back home,” says researcher Casey
Silvey, a dolphin handler who
helped look after the penned ani-
- mals in southern Hillsborough Coun-

The dolphins will be returned to

;_.J_. 1 A ‘A._A‘ _'

Randy Wells, coordinator of the.

Dolphin Research Facility at the
Santa Cruz campus.

If the capture-and-release pro-
gram works as planned, the animals
can expect to live 25 years or more
in the wild.

The expense of capturing and
maintaining a dolphin is high, Wells
said. And that cost stops laborato-
ries and commercial enterprises
such as theme parks from re-releas-
ing the animals, he said.

There are about 300 Atlantic
bottle-nose dolphins in research or
on display in the United States,
Wells said.

If his university’s experiment is
successful, he said, it could lead to
new attitudes that re-releasing dol-
phins after study is practical.

The non-profit group Dolphin Bi-

ology Research Associates will mon-

itor the several hundred dolphins
schooling in Tampa Bay, Wells said.
Wells also is vice president of that
group.

Photographers armed with tele-
photo lenses will record the dorsal
tins of the animals to track their
travels and other habits, Wells said.

He said that a full study of those
dolphins will allow researchers to
log how stable a dolphin school is
and where a good location would be
to release the two mammals just
taken from the water.

Five years old is an ideal age
for dolphin research because they
are less prone to shark attacks and
other dangers then, Howard said.

Researchers said they wanted
two males that already were social-
ly paired, or bonded, because that
makes them less vulnerable and
will make it easier to reintroduce
them to Tampa Bay.

Since their capture, the dolphins
— they weigh 250 to 300 pounds and
are about 7 feet long — have been
feeding on mullet. They swished
through the water late last week as
Silvey and students sat on the pier
in a drizzling rain.

The dolphins’ new quarters are
a large tank with water heated to
that of Tampa Bay’s warm tempera:

- Dolphins
, A re Used A 5
Tuna Traps .

I am sure that every person in Flori-
da has known the joy and wonder of see-
ing a dolphin glide through the water.
Dolphins are one of the most beautiful
mammals in our seas, and no one would
want to be responsible for even one
death among their numbers. Yet every
time the average person opens a can of
tuna, that might be what happens.

According to the Center for Environ-

mental Education, the US. tuna industry-

kills more than 20,500 dolphins a year
using a fishing technique called “setting
on dolphins.”

Large schools of yellowfin tuna swim,

under dolphin herds, so tuna fishermen,
using speedboats and helicopters, rou-

tinely herd groups of terrified dolphins ‘

together and then drop small explosives
to disorient them and keep them from
escaping. Then they encircle the dol-
phins with giant nets in order to catch
the tuna that swim below. '

Thousands of dolphins either die
from fright or are drowned in the fisher-
men’s nets. More’ than 80 percent of the
female dolphins killed in these nets are
either pregnant or nursing calves.

In 1986, the worldwide tuna industry
killed 130,000 dolphins in this manner.
That's more than 350 per day. Yet this
need not happen. Tuna fishermen who
, use this method account for only 10 per-

cent of the total tuna catch. Obviously,
there are more responsible ways to catch
tuna fish.

We can help stop this slaughter by

stopping eating tuna fish. We can write to ‘

our favorite tuna fish company and tell
them that until all of the tuna industry
follows responsible, ~humane fishing prac-
tices, we will boycott their product.

We can also write our congressmen
and the secretary of commerce in sup-
port of the Marine Mammal Protection
Act, which comes up for reauthorization
this year. We can encourage them to de-
crease the annual number of dolphins al-
lowed to be killed by the us. tuna
industry to zero over the next five years.

We can also encourage them to require

the same controls on foreign fishing
ﬂeets. ‘

Our efforts can make the difference

The plight of zoolanimals found

Why are so many of these

One reason, perhaps, is that
the US. Department of Agricul-

trouble prosecuting them. Its
general counsel, which has been
sitting on a case (involving a dead
rhinoceros) since August 1986,
has not been particularly hard on
them. In the roughly 50 cases
that have been prosecuted, its at-
torneys have obtained mostly
“cease and desist” orders and

Deforme ird embryos

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - July 17, 1988
L/

 

U.S. biologists
suspect selenium

. the northern and southern Tulare
- Lake Drainage District systems. a

 

By Russell Clemings

MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVlCE

 

FRESNO -— Deformed embryos
in three kinds of ducks and one
type of shorebird were found last
summer by federal biologists work-
ing at farm—drainage evaporation
ponds in the Tulare Lake basin, the
US. Fish and Wildlife Service has
reported.

The deformities, which were
found in four of the five pond
systems studied, have not been posi-
tively linked to the toxic mineral
selenium, which was blamed for
widespread bird deaths and defor-
mities at the Kesterson National
Wildlife Refuge near Los Banos in
1983.

But a federal biologist who has
studied birds in both areas said the
deformities found in the Tulare
Lake basin were “similar to the de
formities we saw at Kesterson.” and
may havebeen caused by the same
pollutant.

At one set of ponds. the southern
Tulare Lake Drainage District
ponds. the deformity rate in embry—
os of three types of ducks —— mal-
lard, gadwall and pintail —- was 37.5
percent. compared with a rate of 4.9
percent in Kesterson ducks. Nor-
mal deformity rates in unpolluted
areas are thought to be less than 1
percent.

Biologist Harry Ohlendorf. of
the service’s Wildlife Research Cen-
ter Station in Davis, said the de-
formed duck embryos included one
of each species from among eight
eggs collected at the ponds.

“It is a fairly small sample, but it
is a significant increase in the rate
of deformities in comparison to
Kesterson,” Ohlendorf said.

Evaporation ponds are used to
collect and evaporate mineral-lad-
en water from underground drains
on irrigated farms in parts of the
western San Joaquin Valley.

At least 27 such pond systems

covering 5,000.3cres have been built '

to date in the Tulare Lake basin,
mainly in Kings and Kern counties.
and another 4.000 to 6,000 acres are
planned. Twelve ponds covering
l.280 acres were operated at Kester-
son until June 1986.

Federal biologists collected eggs
last summer from five pond

l

systems in the’Tulare menses. e: !

Westlake Farms system north of
Corcoran, a Pryse Farms system
near Corcoran, and the Westfarm-
ers ponds near Lost Hills in Kern
County. -

Of the five, only the northern
Tulare Lake Drainage District
ponds contained no deformed bird
embryos.

The Westlake and Pryse systems
contained deformities at a rate of
less than 2 percent among random-
ly tested eggs.

In the Westfarmers ponds, the
deformity rate for avocets was 6.9
percent, almost the same as the 5.7
percent deformity rate for the.
same species of shorebird at Kester-
son.
Ohlendorf said none of the de-
formities can be positively tied to
selenium until chemical tests on tis-
sues and eggs from the affected
species are finished.

But he indicated there was
strong circumstantial evidence -
including the presence of high sele~ é
nium levels in some of the evapora- 3,
tion ponds and the types of defor- ’l
mities found —- to indicate that the vi
toxic mineral is to blame. i

“Based on the embryos down
there that I saw, they’re similar to
those I saw at Kesterson, which
would indicate there may be a
chemical problem there as well,"
Ohlendorf said.

Selenium is common in the
shales and other seabed sediments
that make. up the Coast Ranges and
the nearby valley floor. It is picked
up by irrigation water as it trickles
downward through the soil, and is
left behind when drain water evap-
orates from the ponds.

Recent evidence has shown ris-
ing levels of selenium in the Tulare
Lake Drainage District and West-
farmers ponds -— an average of 25
parts per billion of selenium in wa-
ter from the Tulare Lake Drainage
District ponds and from 110 to 360
ppb in the Westfarmers ponds. As
little as 5 ppb can be a hazard to
birds.

The state Department of Fish
and Game is proposing new restric-
tions on evaporation pond use to
protect wildlife. The department's
proposal would require evapora-
tion pond operators to stop birds
from nesting and feeding in the
ponds by frightening them away if
selenium levels in the birds' food

 

 

 

sources reach dangerous levels.

It‘s Too Hot Here
For Horse Carriages

Thank God for the media showing na-
tionwide the plight of helpless carriage
horses being removed from the streets of
New York (CBS, June 23) by a police
officer who ordered one driver to obtain
water for an exhausted animal that was
obviously suffering from heat exhaustion.

All across the United States, tempera-
ture charts clearly show this is one of the
worst summers for drought and unusual~
ly high temperatures. This is even more
evident in the South where the heat dis-
comfort index is well in the 90 percent
range.

However, the St. Petersburg City
Council and Bay Plaza developers still
plan to proceed with horse-drawn car-
riages in St. Petersburg.

What an incongruous sight -— horses
being subjected to a life of misery with
the potential of heat stroke, inadequate
watering facilities and shade, hours on
hard, hot pavement in slippery steel
shoes, not to mention the threat to hu-
man safety. Carriages are difficult to see
in the evening, and waste from horses
causes sanitation problems in the heat
that cannot be eliminated by diaper bags
or other ludicrous solutions.

Humane societies on national, state
and local levels are all opposed to horse-
drawn carriages. Suffering animals on
the streets will not attract tourists.

It is to be hoped that the consciences
of city council and Bay Plaza developers
will be touched, it not with compassion,
then common sense. At that point, surely
they will put a halt to this outdated at-
traction. It belongs in the 19th century
and is totally incompatible with modern-

Tday living. Gandhi once said, “A nation is

judged by how it treats its animals.”

LOS ANGELES TIMES - July 21, 1988

Ban Urged on Religious Sacrificing,

‘By SCOTT HARRIS, Times Staff Writer '

Alarmed by the increasing discoveries of '

disfigured animal carcasses, Los Angeles

officials are studying a proposed ordinance . '

that would outlaw the sacrifice and maim-
ing of animals for religious purposes.

The law, backed by animal rights activ-.

ists, would in effect discourage the practic—
es of Santeria, a secretive Afro-Cuban
religion that authorities say is apparently

on the rise in Los Angeles. Itgwould also .

outlaw similar practices by Satanic cults.

Practitioners of Santeria—described by
authorities as a hybrid of voodoo and
Roman Catholicism—kill goats, sheep and
chickens in a variety of rituals. In - Los
Angeles, there is no , law to preVent
sacrificial killings if the animals are killed
in a “humane” manner, authorities say.

Arthur Margolis, a member of the city’s
Board of Animal Regulation, proposed the
. ordinance at a meeting of the board this
week. The board is considering the propos-
al. ' ‘

Animals. “It’s quite apparent these animals
are not being hit by cars or eaten by
coyotes.” »

Acknowledging most evidence to be
anecdotal, Reed said animal sacrifices are
“becoming more commonplace clear across
"the country.” “And we are talking about a
type of activity where people are not going
to discuss it.” ‘

Police Authority

Los Angeles Police Detective Patrick
Metoyer, considered an authority on occult
practices, said many of the discoveries
suggest that the animals were used in
Santeria rituals. The religion, with roots in
the Yoruba tribe of Nigeria, is practiced
widely in Cuba, Haiti and Brazil.

Los Angeles is reportedly the third-larg-
est U.S. center of Santeria, after Miami and
New York. Sociologists believe there may
be more than 50,000 Santeria devotees in

the Los Angeles area, centered mostly in

The Humane Society of the United

States is promoting 'a model ordinance for

municipalities nationwide that carries pen-
alties of up to six months in jail and a fine of

* animal sacrifice. -
“There are certain religious practices,

that are just offensive to the area in which
you live,” said Charlene Drennon, West

Coast director of the animal protection

group.
Florida Law

The proposed Los Angeles ordinance is
based on a Hialeah, Fla, law that is being
challenged by Santeria devotees as a
violation of First Amendment rights to
freely practice their religion. Santeria
followers are typically discreet about their

, beliefs and practices, authorities say. The

organized Hialeah group is an exception. '
In interviews, Los Angeles animal con-

trol officers said there is no question that

to reach Santeria members for comment in
Los Angeles and elsewhere were unsuc-
cessful.

Santeria uses animals in various rituals,
Metoyer said. In a “cleansing” ritual, for
example, ..a so-called holy person would
decapitate a chicken, drain its blood on a
believer, then wipe the blood off with the
feathered body of the chicken, the detec—
tive said.

Police and animal control officers say
they have encountered Santeria devotees
in a variety of circumstances.

Most recently, authorities raided aHaw-
thorne home last week, seizing a yard full
of animals-22 chickens, two goats, a

piglet, a lamb—that they said were mal-

nourished and infested with lice. They also
found several chicken carcasses, four goat-
skins and dried blood, indicating that the
animals had been slaughtered in the yard.

Last fall, Reed said, officers

' Religious icons and candles sug-

Santeria. The owners were charged
with animal cruelty violations,
Reed said.

Metoyer said it has become in-
creasingly common, especially in
Latino neighborhoods, for police
during investigations to discover
animal blood, suggesting Santeria.

Satanic cults also practice animal
sacrifices, often torturing them in
the process, Metoyer said.

Devil worshipers, the detective
said, often kill cats and rub their
bodies with cat blood in the belief
that they can “amass power”
through the ritual.

Sobat. “At least they're showing interest——
which is pretty neat. How long did we have
the pandas before they did anything?”

The 200’s newest residents, whose ex-
hibit officially opened yesterday, are the
only pair of Komodo dragons on public view
in the Western Hemisphere. The dragons
are the largest species of lizards on earth

and conjure up prehistoric images of what ,

life might have been like during the Age of
Reptiles.

Komodo dragons are considered an en-
dangered species. Except for the few that
have been put in zoos, the lizards—who
grow to be 10 feet long and weigh 200
pounds—are found only on six small islands
in the 3,200-mile-long Indonesian archipe-
lago.

Friendty and Sobat. who are about 6

years old, are gifts from Indonesia. They

were presented as a male and female pair,
but it is difficult to tell a lizard's sex, and of-
ficials were reluctant to anesthetize the an‘
imals and X ray them for a closer look.

The lizards, who could live to be 35 to 50
years old, arrived at the zoo May 12 and
were kept in separate holding cells while of-
ficials made sure each was healthy. They
were recently reintroduced and ensconced

, in a‘ special enclosure behind the

Reptile House on Wednesday. _

Apart from the lizards’ steamy
activity, the enclosure itself is said
to be the “hottest exhibit we have,"
according to Marcellini, because
the cold-blooded dragons like it that
way.

“Yesterday it got to be 110 de-

grees in there, and they were run-

ning around as happy as could be, ”
he said. “These two love Washing-
ton, D. C.”

But even Marcellini said he was

surprised to see the lizards adjust-_

ing to each other so lustily.

“I never expected to see this so
fast. I'm overjoyed,” said Marcellini,
admiring the amorous advances of
Friendty, who at 41/2 feet long is
bigger than his female cagemate.
Neither is fully grown.

The zoo had hoped all along to

mate the two, and Marcellini said-

that it’s useful to know the pair is
actually mate-worthy.

., It also helps that the enclosure .

has been designed to resemble an
Indonesian creek bank, with plants

, to remind the lizards of home.

; In winter, the zoo will install sup-

_ 'plemental heat to keep the pair

‘And when they get older and out-
grow their propensity for climbing,
they will get an outside yard.

BY JOEL RICHARDSON—THE WASHINGTON POST

Komodo dragons cavort in simulated Indonesian mud bank at the National Zoo.

Marcellini said that despite
F nendty s best efforts yesterday,
Sobat is probably too sexually 1m-
mature to produce any offspring as
yet. This would account, he said, for
her apparent lack of interest in her
partner.

A successful mating would result
in the female laying eggs in a few

weeks, followed by an 8-month wait
before hatching.

Komodo dragons have never
been bred successfully outside of
Indonesia.

The National Zoo had another
pair of Komodo dragons more than
a decade ago; the female laid eggs
that never hatched.

In the wild, the lizards feast on
insects, other lizards, birds and
small mammals.

At the zoo, they will dine on dead
rodents and chickens. They get fed

 

once a week, usually a rat or two,
Marcellini said.

The new exhibit drew curious
gawkers yesterday, including Sue
Clifford of Northwest Washington
and her four children. John Clifford,
4, and his sister, Caitlin, 6, their
faces as close to the window as they
could manage, came up with an apt

description they both could live 4

with. The Komodos, they agreed,
“look like dmosaurs.”

Phase 1 of the the exhibit,
which is to be completed in the
fall of 1989, will include six habi—
tats on 25 acres encircled by the
monorail. Animals to appear
along the route will include leop-
ards, gorillas and various kinds of
antelope.

Succeeding phases will focus
on creation of habitats for ele-
phants, rhinos, lions, tigers; the
construction of a restaurant, ani-
mal hospital, breeding areas and
other buildings; and the replace-
ment of the 200’s existing build-
ings.

“When we’re finished (the
timetable for that is the year
2000), we should have the ﬁnest
zoo in the country,” Iliff said.

The 25-minute trip around the
habitat areas was unlike any
monorail ride anywhere, Iliff
said. He said the design of the
cars makes for excellent viewing
with a minimum of distractions.

Each of three Swiss-made
trains has 13 cars, each seating
eight people. Passengers board
from the right side of the train
and ﬁnd seats facing outward to
the left side in two rows, not un-
like theater balcony seats. Doors
close behind them, thus shutting
off the View of animal barns, 200
buildings, nearby streets and
fences, all of which are to the
right side of the trains.

Each car has room for a wheel-
chair. “Or baby strollers,” said
Lyria Howland, a member of the
200’s board of directors. “We al-
ways have a lot of those at the
200.”

The left side of each car is
open, allowing visitors to hear
the animals and sometimes feel
the environment. A mist ma-
chine, for instance, will spray wa-
ter as the train descends into the
jungle area.

IKE NOAH and his ark, zoos in the past aimed at
collecting two of everything.

But that mission has changed as man and his
bulldozers closed in on the habitat of the animal world
in the last century, obliterating some species from the
planet and endangering others.

Zoos of today have a goal of teaching the delicate
balance that exists among Earth’s creatures, and the

~ catastrophic costs of tipping that balance.

The St. Louis Zoo will take a major step to the
forefront of these efforts next spring with the opening of
its new $16 million educational center, The Living
World.

The Living World will combine the greatest variety of
animal species and high-tech exhibits ever assembled
under one roof.

“The Living World will set the stage for the zoos of the
future -— it’s a history-making step,” said Robert
Hyland, senior vice president of CBS Radio in St. Louis

. and the prime mover behind the project as president of
the St. Louis Zoological Park Commission. '

Christmas Given Preview At Z00

By Victor Volland
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

The folks who brought us the
Christmas in St. Louis celebration
last December brought Christmas
in July to the St. Louis, Zoo on
Monday.

A fully buttontd-up Santa Claus
and Victorian-costumed carolers
withstood the sticky humidity in-
side the main entrance to greet zoo
visitors, who wore more seasonable
attire and somewhat bewildered
expressions.

“We're here to give people a lit-
tle preview of what’s in store dur-
ing the holiday season and to let
them know about the nearly 100 St.
Louis area charities that are helped
by Christmas in St. Louis,” ex-
plained John B. Hayes Jr., chair-
man of the 1988 celebration. -

Christmas in St. Louis is an um-
brella organization founded three
years ago by a group made up pri-
marily of downtown businessmen
and civic leaders to coordinate
holiday activities and events and to
start a few new ones, such as a
downtown parade and the simulta-
neous lighting of office and govern-

ment buildings.

This year’s celebration, which
starts on Thanksgiving weekend,
will also include a dog sled race, a
New Year’s Eve fireworks show on
the riverfront and a series of holi-
day concerts and entertainment
downtown and in suburban shop-
ping malls and hospitals. The
Christmas Carols Association’s an-
nual Carols Festival will again be at
Kiel Auditorium, but the Festival of
the Trees, which benefits the Jude-
vine Center for Autistic Children,
will move to Northwest Plaza.

“We picked today, the 25th, to
announce our plans because it is
exactly five months till Christmas,”
Hayes said. “We assumed the the
weather would be warm, but we
didn’t anticipate anything like
this.” Hayes, who is president of
Southwest Bell Telephone Co., ad-
mitted he was “soaking wet” under
his perfectly pressed business suit
and never-let-’em-see-you—sweat
demeanor.

The official temperature then
read only 88, but the relative hu-
midity was a high 55 percent, mak-
ing it pretty uncomfortable for
those outside.

“Now I know why the Lord has
his birthday in December,” said
Whitney Harris, who with his wife,
Jane, sponsors the annual gala that
precedes the Festival of the Trees
auction, one of the Christmas in St.
Louis charity functions.

Amy Garcia, 5, of Breese, 111.,
was oblivious to the weather as she
plopped herself in Santa’s lap and
announced she wanted a doll and
stroller. When asked if she thought
it might be too hot to think about
Christmas, she smiled tolerantly
and slowly shook her head.

Bill Peters, 74, was playing Santa
beneath real whiskers and a win-
ter-weight red velveteen outfit. But
he had an ice pack under his stock-
ing cap and was continually being
fed cool drinks and having his brow
mopped by Kathy Roland, an emer-
gency medical technician from St.
Louis University Hospital.

“1 think I lost 10 pounds here
today. But it’s still the best job a
man could have,” said Peters, who
has worked as a department store
Santa since he retired nine years
ago.

been put off, possibly until early
March.

“Everything that’s in here alive
will actually come from the Courtois.

, Huzzah and Meramec," Johnson said.
‘ “The Zoo staff mill go out and collect
, it. There will be a large snapping tur-

tle down here. It will be an awful lot
of fun.”

Johnson, 46, is coauthor of the na-

tion's top—selling college biology text-
book with Peter Raven. director of

Shaw’s Garden. But Johnson said The
Living World. with its fusion of high—
tech computers and more than 150
species of live animals. would pro-
vide a unique teaching experience.

“For instance. you can see what
would happen to the stream if you
poisoned the fish or shot the duck. We
will have a computer that would an-
swer that question. What if you pour a
Coke into it, how does that change the
pH (acidity level.)

“If you learn something like that in
a hands-on, guts way, you'll never for-
get it.”

That’s precisely the message the
Zoo is hoping to get across at the new
center - how humans' often mind-
less tinkering, and sometimes wanton
destruction affects the delicate bal-
ance of life, leaving some species en-
dangered and other extinct.

“What's new about zoos in the last
generation is the world around the
zoos is changing -— we’re losing a lot
of animals,” Johnson said. “It's not
fair, as a zoo, to moan about the
world going to hell and not do any-
thing about it. This is the first zoo that
has put this kind of money behind it.

“Before we had this building you
could bring a high school class to the
Zoo, and they could see the animals.
Now we can use the Zoo in a much
more sophisticated way.”

Charles “Chip" Reay, the architect
invoived in designing the exhibits.
said the delay in the center’s official
opening would allow fine-tuning with
smaller groups of visitors.

“This is an inordinately complex
undertaking," Reay said. “We’re ac-
tually not delaying the date of avail—
ability as much as delaying the grand
opening.

“We want to polish the edges and
make sure everything is running in
perfect order before we get crowds of
8,000 or 10.000 a day,"

And Reay said the wait would be
worth it.

He described just two of the com-
puterized displays: (Line will use film

mountains and rain forests. The other

will allow visitors to change one as
pect of an area, perhaps increase its
annual rainfall and see what havoc
results.

But Rcay said the real stars of the
center would remain the inhabitants
of the Zoo. He pointed out that. the
lighting would enhance the brilliance
of nature's creatures. 4

“The intensity of the color comes
off in a theatrical setting," he said.
“The living things begin to glow and
have a presence, much more than in
the tiliiltiten’s Zoo or the Remit-e
House.

"We‘re picking things for their
beauty. their exoticncss, their gec-
whiz quality. The iivinr, things should

MEMPHIS COMVIERCIAL APPEAL - July 31, 1988

Cooperation
ensures survival

 

By John Beifuss
Staff Reporter

 

Taj, the white tiger that went
on display Saturday at the Mem-
phis Zoo, is a living symbol of
the cooperation now necessary
for zoos —- and their animals —
to survive.

The issue is as black and white
as Taj: Without this cooperation,
especially the loaning of ani-
mals from one zoo to another,
many species would become ex-
tinct. _

“We all realize that many of
these rare animals almost
shouldn’t have ownership,” said
Warren Iliff, director of the Dal-
las Zoo. “They belong to their
species.”

“Collaboration today is the
guarantee for the future,” said
Charles Wilson, director of the
3 Memphis Zoo. “If you don’t coop

‘erate today, there will be noth-
ing to cooperate on in the fu-
'ture.”

. Taj, 3 years old and 300 pounds,
is on loan to Memphis through
Sept. 10 from the Columbus Zoo
in Ohio. She made her public de-
but shortly after 10 am. Satur-
day in the newly refurbished
anate House.

Within an hour, the striped
star had achieved panda mode:
back to the crowd, asleep on the
ﬂoor. As 3-year-old Jeremy Wo-
mack reported: “We saw a big ol’
tiger; he lay down and go to
sleep.”

“We came last year and saw
the panda, and he was sleeping,
but they (sons Jeremy, and
Matthew, 11/2) didn’t care be-
cause they got their T-shirts,”
said Sandra Womack, 33. She
said white tiger T-shirts would
make Saturday’s zoo visit memo-
rable, too.

Agnes Littrell, business man-
ager at the zoo, said about 4,500

 

 

people — about 25 percent more
than usual — visited the zoo Sat-
’urday.

_' The white tiger, brought to
Memphis after meetings

’ between Mayor Dick Hacltett
and Columbus Mayor Dana Rine- '

Chart, is the third special-loan ex- _

hibition at the zoo in the past
four years. '

Taj represents future
for zoos and animals

T; *In May 1985, Ayers, the koala,

gust, 226,538 visited the zoo to

ark in

from Chapultepec
Mexico City.

With the white tiger, “We can
~new say we’ve done the triple
crown in zoo animals,” Wilson
Said.

; “Definitely, those three ani-
mals are the top ones in popular-
Ity,” said Jean Gertmenian, pub-
lic information officer with the
San Diego Zoo, which this year
has loaned koalas for display in
i zoos as far away as Toronto, Can-
ada, and Dublin, Ireland. She
. said San Diego exhibited a white
:tiger on loan from the Cincin-
' hati Zoo in 1984. .
' “These type of significant pub

lic appeal loans have only been
‘5 going on the last decade,” Wil-
‘i son said. These loans are for pub-

;licity, fund-raising and enter-
‘ tainment purposes. They create
, interest in the zoo, which should
;- mean greater membership —

3 and more money — for the Mem- ,

phis Zoological Society.

1‘ I The society, which is helping

to sponsor Taj’s visit, will re-

‘ ceive a certain percentage of zoo
admission revenues during Au-
gust, as well as the profits from
several white tiger souvenir
stands. The money will go to-
ward “Cat Country," a planned
Open-air facility with naturalis-
tic exhibit areas that would re-
place the stone-and-bars build-
ing where the 200’s big cats live.
- The majority of zoo loans are
for breeding purposes. This is
the type of cooperation that is
necessary for the survival of
2003 and their animals.

 

; 3 At any given time, a large

3 number of animals in a zoo may

' be there on a breeding loan. In
fact, some animals may be on
loan for years.
f For instance, Junior the
orangutan has been in Memphis
about 15 years, on loan from Tul-
sa. Rocky, the popular gorilla in

the exhibit next door to Taj, has ‘

been in Memphis for nine years,
on loan from Phoenix.

Junior has produced three ;
surviving offspring with his:

Memphis-owned mate, Sally.

Rocky was brought to Memphis

to learn to socialize with goril-

las, and only recently has en—
. tered breeding age.
_' Currently, about 20 mammals
are on breeding loans to Mem-
phis, and about 10 mammals are
on loan from Memphis to other
. zoos. About nine birds are here
on loan, and about 18 are out on
E loan. About 25 reptiles and am-
: phibians are here on loan, and
about 60 are out on loan.

Other animals on breeding
loan to Memphis include a Ma-
layan tapir, aardwolves, a bald
eagle and a Chinese alligator.
Animals out on loan include a
snow leopard, an Asian ele-
, phant, an Egyptian vulture and
1 several dwarf crocodiles.

 

 

 

Katherine
Frisby, 3, waits
on the
shoulders of
her dad, H.
Grady Frisby
III, for a look at
Taj.

 

 




Many of these loans are orga-
nized under the Species Survrval
Plan of the American Assoc1-
ation of Zoological Parks and
Aquariums. The SSP develops
guidelines for the propagation
of species, including an tip-to-
date “stud book" of available
breeders. So far, about 43 spec1es
are managed under SSP. pro-
grams. Memphis owns animals
from about 19 of those spec1es.

Most zoos follow SSP sugges-

tions for breeding loans involv-,

in endangered species. It was
83% officials who matched Car-

Photographs by Richard Gardner.

Ios, the Memphis Zoo’s prolific
male gorilla, with Hope, a female
gorilla at the North Carolina Zoo
in Asheboro who had not pro-
duced any offspring.

Most zoos do not own enough
specimens of a species to devel-
op a self-sustaining population.
For instance, a 200 with a pair of
animals that produces offspring
has to seek mates from other
zoos for the offspring to prevent
the inbreeding of animals from
the same ‘family,’ which wea-
kens the genetic strength of a
species.

A loan is “an investment in the
future,” Wilson said.

teacher Lois Davis stayed home
and worked part-time as a beau“
tician. This summer, she’s over-
seeing young tutors in a class
preparing 5-year-olds for kinder-
garten. '

For the first time — except
when rural schools used to hold
classes in the summer so stu-
dents could work in the fields in
the fall - Earle School District

, has summer classes.

“Everyone is here on a volun-
‘ teer basis,” said program creator
Jack Crumbly, of Widener, an
Earle Middle School science
. teacher. “No one is compelled to
come.”

Crumbly added, “A lot of peo—
ple told me, ‘There’s no way you
can get those kids in the sum-
mertime.’ ’3 Moreover, most of
the classrooms aren’t air-condi-
tioned.

But about 150 children in the
third through eighth grades and
pre-kindergartners are being tu-
tored by about 30 high school
students. Eight certified teach-
ers participate, too. The summer
classes, 8 a.m.-2 p.m., started at
Earle Middle School June 20 and
end Aug. 12.

Crumbly is sweetening the
classwork with physical educa-

 

tion sessions, swimming lessons
and three field trips to Memphis
courtesy of a grant from the
Rockefeller Foundation: Stu-
dents first went to Mud Island
and the Memphis Pink Palace
Museum; they visited Chucalissa
Indian Museum and the Mem-
phis Zoo Friday, and they’re g0«
ing to Libertyland.

Crumbly calls the program RI-
SE/MOVE (Remedial Instruc-
tion Strengthens Education /Mo-
tivational Opportunities for a Vi-
tal Education).

The RISE part provides free tu-
toring for students in the dis-
trict who are performing below
their grade level or simply hav-
ing trouble with their class-
work, Crumbly said. MOVE pro-

vides tutorial jobs for high
school students who maintain at
least a B average.

Crumbly began the program
in December, and extended it
with summer school. The effort
has been so successful that the
people who are footing most of
the bill are talking about ex-
panding it into four other coun-
ties.

Twenty-three of the 26 eighth-
graders who participated in
RISE at least 60 percent of the
time passed the state’s Minimum
Performance Test last spring.
Overall for the district, 68 per-
cent of the eighth-graders
passed, Crumbly said.

The program works even bet-
ter with younger students. All
third-graders in the program
passed the state’s test, Crumbly
said.

Eight-graders are required to
pass the Minimum Performance
Test before they are promoted;
third graders. aren’t.

Sharon Williams, executive di-
rector of the Eastern Arkansas
Private Industry Council, said
the agency is considering fund-
ing similar program in Cross, St.
Francis, Lee, Phillips and in oth-
er schools in Crittenden County. ‘
The council, a nonprofit organi-
zation, uses funds funneled
through the state by the federal
Jobs Training Partnership Act.

Jimmy Carter’s media party Saturday

'evening pulled in the two most famous

newsmen in America —+ Walter Cronkite
and Lou Grant.

Ed Asner, the activist actor who played
Lou Grant on TV, even bussed the former
president on the cheek when the two shook
hands among the throngs at the Wter
Presidential Center. The media reception
also marked the debut of a film, narrated

by Cronkite, on the pres1dential succession '
process. ,

The affair was probably THE IN
EVENT of the day before the day before
the Democratic National Convention be-
gins. At least that was the opinion of some
of the people who attended. Stuffing their
faces with pasta salad and sipping beer,
wine or club soda were a Who’s Who of ce-
lebrity journalists. The guest list included
Dan Rather, Judy Woodruff, Art Buchwald,
and even Larry King, live.

Carter and former first lady Rosalynn
Carter mingled, often posing for snapshots
and enthusiastically hugging well-wishers.
Carter noted that the party’s “friendly envi-
ronment” was decidedly different than the
atmosphere a decade ago when he encoun-
tered many of these guests at White House
news conferences.

Tongue in cheek, Carter allowed that ‘

all he had to do to bring about this new era
of goodwill was build a multimillion-dollar
presidential center and arrange for the
Democrats to hold their contention in At-
lanta so the reporters would have an oppor-
tunity to visit.

Actually, air conditioning was the par-
ty’s big attraction for some reporters.

It had been as hot as Georgia in July
when they trailed Bert Lance that morning
to an outdoor buffet brunch at Zoo Atlanta.

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH

July 10, 1988

 

By Tom Uhlenbrock
Of the Post- -Dispatch Staff

Rick Coonrod is eager to get out
of his bed at Barnes Hospital and
back to his keeper’s job at the St.
Louis Zoo, but he says he probably
will ask for reassignment away
from the Elephant House.

“Birds, maybe -— how’s that for
an extreme?" Coonrod said Satur-
day. “I don’t know if I want to go
back into that building yet. I’m kind
of hesitant.”

Coonrod, 40, was in charge of the
Elephant House on July 1 and was
called to assist a keeper recently
transferred to the house. .They
were moving a hippopotamus in an
outside pool with its 2-week-old
baby.‘

“She was real antsy that day; we
were having trouble getting her out
of the pool,” he said. “She doesn’t
leave the pool readily because
that’s sanctuary.”

Lured by alfalfa and carrots
sprinkled on the ground, the 3,000-
pound hippo moved from the pool
into an adjacent paddock area.
Coonrod then began locking the
iron gate behind her.

“I got it closed but I didn’t get it
locked," he said. “She spun around
and hit the gate and that’s when it
all happened. The gate hit me'right
in the face and knocked me woozy.
It’s all pretty foggy after that.”

According to witnesses to the at-
tack. Coonrod was knocked into a
rock-lined moat. The hippo then
charged into the moat, stomping on
him and biting him on the left arm.

Coonrod’s left leg was mauled
and broken. He suffered a puncture
wound on the left arm. He current-
ly is taking therapy in his room for
nerve damage that has limited his

movement of both limbs. ‘

“There’s a reasonable-sized hole
from the tooth,” he said. “When she
bit down, she smashed and bruised
the nerve in my arm."

Coonrod has been a keeper at the
Zoo since 1970 and spent 13 years

assisting in the elephant show.

He said that Nile River hippos
are dangerous animals. “More peo-

.ple are killed in Africa by hippos

than any single animal,” he said.

He had worked with the female
hippo for two years, including when
she gave birth last year.

“You have situations where vari-
ables happen, and unless you' re a
psychic, you have to go back to
square one because an animal’s be-
havior changes totally," he said.

Coonrod said it had been neces-

”Ii

sary to move the hippo because she

had spent the two Weeks after giv-
ing birth in the pool and needed to
get out and eat so she could nourish
the baby and keepers could clean
the pool.

The attack was the first serious
accident at the Zoo in more than
two decades.

Coonrod said doctors had given
him no timetable for his return to
work.

“We’ve always had good control
over the elephants; we’ve always
worked through any disciplinary
problems with such ease,” he said.
“But after an accident like this, you
have to re-evaluaie your whole sit-
uation in life.

“I want: to go back to the Zoo
because it’s a wonderful organiza-
tion. But large animals . . . . "

Despite soo petitions and
ots of angry telephone calls,
‘an Francisco Mayor Art Agnos
aid yesterday that he will not
verrule the city’s animal ex-
.. erts in the controversial trans-
er of Josephine the orangutan
mm the zoo.

Zoo benefactors Carroll and Vi.
let Soo-lloo, who have been protes-
‘ing Josephine’s planned move to
he Philadelphia Zoo, left their first
atch of petitions at the mayor’s
fiice yesterday. They promised to
ome back with more opposing Jo»

phine’s trip east, away from her
ate and child, for further breed-
, ng. .

“Please do not allow Josephine
o be shipped away. Step this cruel-
y to animals," reads the petition
nt to Agnos.

Agnes aide Eileen Maloney said
I e mayor will not make intervene.

“His (Agnos’) belief is that these .

ecisions are best made by protes-
onals when you’re in a situation

1'. -4»..w.-..;u‘... “Lisa J .

L;

where an endangered species is con—
cerned,” Maloney said. “However,
he has asked that they review their
policy and hold public hearings."

Reverberations of the protest
are being felt at City Hall, where
Supervisor Richard Hongisto has
called for a hearing into Josephine’s

proposed move.

Earlier this week, Agnes sent
the orangutan question along to the
Recreation and Parks Commission.
Commission President Keith Eick-
man said yesterday that the city is
bound by an agreement to loan its
animals to other zoos under the Na-
tional Species Survival Plan.

As far as San Francisco is con-
cerned, zoo director Saul Kitchener
decides on the comings and goings
of individual endangered animals
under the program, Eickman said.
Kitchener believes that Josephine
should be mated to an orangutan
from the island of Borneo to pre-
serve the purity of that subspecies.
That means a transfer to Philadel-
phia, where a young Bornean male
orangutan named Bim awaits her.

The San Francisco Zoo is
among a number of US. zoos that

SAN FRASNCISCO CHRONICLE - June 23, 1988

participate in the survival plan,
which has recommended relocating
at least 70 orangutans. International
records kept at the San Diego Zoo
say there are 306 orangutans in

collected their petition signatures
at the 200’s orangutan enclosure,
where Josephine, her mate, Denny,
and their child, Violet, swing from
the monkey bars.

Hall knows enough to decide what’s
bestfor these animals’

 

Nerth America, including 86 Borne-
an, 126 Sumatran and 103 subspecif-
ic hybrids.

The San Francisco Zoo is one of
56 in the United States and Canada
that exhibit orangutans.

“You have to rely on the profes-
sionals,” Maloney said. “Neither the
mayor or anyone at City Hall knows
enough to decide what’s best for
these animals. What mayor does?”

In fact, among those who have
joined the “Keep Josephine” move-
ment is Walnut Creek Mayor Ed
Skoog, who said he called Agnes
with a personal plea to “have a
heart.”

Skoog, who met the Soo-Hoos
on a trip to Africa, joined legions of
animal rights advocates and con.
cerned zoo patrons who have jump-
ed into the tray with Kitchener.

“I’ve personally been in the
cage with the orangutans a number
of years ago and I’m aware of their
intelligence,” the Walnut Creek

mayor said. “There’s a great deal of.
family feeling between those ani-

mals.”

The arguments of science and ?

policy that dictate Josephine’s move
have not squelched a widening pub-
lic outcry.

The Soo-Hoos said they easily

 

The Soo—Hoos donated Denny
to the zoo, and Violet is named after
Mrs. Soo-Hoo.

It appeared yesterday that ani-
mal rights organizations were en-
tering the battle.

The movement of primates un-
der the Species Survival Plan is a
coverup for the practice of “ware-
housing" animals that is compara-
ble to “white slavery,’? said Rena
Grendall of Citizens for a Better
Zoo, a group that has had a continu-
ing series of disagreements with the

city over the way the San Francisco
Zoo is run.

Sandra Keller, director of the
organization, also disputed Kitche-
ner’s statements that Josephine and
Denny do not get along. The orang-
utans have not bred in the last three
years because Josephine is kept on
birth control pills and the two are
separated at night, she said.

Elliot Katz, a veterinarian and
head of Madera-based In‘Defense of
Animals,disagreed with the goal of
keeping orangutan bloodlines pure
to preserve the species. '

By mating orangutans from dif-
ferent genetic backgrounds, the
species is bound to be strengthened,
Katz said.

“It’s obvious the orangutan
needs some genetic diversity,” he
said.

“And besides, who cares when
they go to the zoo whether they’re
looking at a pure Sumatran orang-
utan or a pure Bornean orang-
utan?” he asked. “There’s so little
difference. Who gives a damn?”

THE ATLANTA JOURNAL - July 25, 1988

Z00 StaﬂMakes Life-or—Daath Vow:
5th Panda Born There Will Survive

_ By Karlyn Barker - i

The \l’rlshington Post

WASHINGTON — Ling-Ling and
Hsing-Hsing. the nation‘s celebrated
giant panda pair, are expected to
become parents again by early Au-
gust, and experts at the National
Zoo are readying never-tried meas-
ures to retrieve a new cub from
mother Ling—Ling and inject it with
immunity-producing antibodies
from father Hsing-Hsing’s blood.

Such human manipulation,
which includes anesthetizing the
mother shortly after she gives birth
and returning the cub to her later,
is normally taboo with pandas. The
mother-cub bond is often fragile,
and zoos have never successfully
hand~raised a panda cub.

But, after four cub deaths, the
National Zoo has chosen to mount a
full—court press of human help this
time. believing that its intervention
could mean the difference between
life or death for a cub. Also, time is
running out on aging Ling-Ling’s
ability to boost the world’s endan-
gered giant panda population, num-
bered at fewer than 1,000, including
only 14 outside China.

“All animals are equally marvel-
ous," said zoo Director Michael
Robinson, who gets a bit testy at the
“goo-goo response” elicited by the
photogenic but increasingly slothful
pandas. “But something that’s taken
millions of years to evolve can’t be
allowed to die off. You can never
recreate another panda.”

For 16 years at the National
Zoo, the cute, furry, black-and-white
creatures —- a gift from the People’s
Republic of China — have been re-
ceiving collective, if symbolic, bear
hugs from the public. Their dramat-
ic breeding saga — the early, fruit-
less attempts to mate, the births
and heartbreaking deaths of tiny,
rare panda cubs —— has captured the
attention of Washington and much
of the country.

Since 1983, Ling-Ling, consid-
ered an exemplary mother, has had
four cubs. One was stillborn; two
died within hours. The fourth lived
nearly four days.

The 200 is aching to breed what
would be the United States’ first
surviving panda cub. The two pan-
das have greatly increased the 200’s
knowledge and ability to care for
the species. Ling-Ling, 19, and
Hsing-Hsing (pronounced Shing—

Shing by the zoo folks), 18, have
lived longer than any other panda
pair in captivity outside China.

Devra Kleiman, assistant direc-
tor for research and the 200’s ac-
knowledged “panda lady,” said staff
and volunteer panda watchers have
monitored play behavior, vocaliza-
tion, heat and pregnancy cycles, and
cub births.

Ling-Ling’s hormone levels this
month, very similar to ones she ex-
hibited before having twins last
year, have led to guarded predic-
tions of a likely birth between July
29 and Aug. 7. National Geographic
magazine has placed eight video
cameras in the brick Panda House
to film the outcome.

 

The panda mother-cub
bond is often fragile, and
zoos have never success-
fully hand-raised a cub.

“We plan to anesthetize the
mother and put hands on the baby,”
said Mitchell Bush, the 200’s chief
veterinarian. He calls the proce-
dure a logical effort to keep a
healthy cub healthy.

All giant panda cubs probably
are born with very little immunity
but normally receive temporary
protection by absorbing antibodies,
usually through their mother’s milk,
until their own immune system de-
velops, according to Bush and the
200’s chief pathologist, Richard
Montali.

The two have pored over'what
little data exists about panda pro-
creation and have studied the
deaths of eight cubs: the four that
died at their own zoo, one in Ma-
drid, Spain, and three in Mexico
City, where four of only six surviv-
ing cubs outside China have been
bred successfully.

Using that information, they de-
vised the plan that will include
Hsing-Hsing. Blood drawn from him
has gone to a nearby lab, where it is
being turned into a serum of puri-
fied antibodies to inject into a new
cub. The 200 has done this proce—
dure for years on other animals, but
never using such a concentrated
dose of antibodies — and never on
pandas

The Madrid zoo retrieved and

successfully returned a cub to its
mother in 1982.: but it did not anes-

thetize themother or inject antin

bodies into the cub.

The National Zoo staff has be-
come more at ease and more knowl-
edgeable about its panda residents.
particularly since using hands-on,
M*A*S*H-like emergency treatment
in late 1983 to cure Ling-Ling of a
near-fatal kidney infection and ane-
mia. The panda was so sick that
Bush called a zoo spokesman from
the animal hospital to warn that she
might not come out of the
anesthetic. '

In the end, the veterinary and
pathology staffs used what Bush
calls “a lot of experience and a gut
feeling for the animals” to diagnose
and treat the panda with the right.
antibiotics.

That panda crisis was a far cry
from the optimistic hoopla that sur-
rounded the pair’s arrival April 16,
1972, from the Beijing Zoo.

The arrival was hailed as tangi-
ble results of President Nixon’s
“Journey for Peace” to China: the
first giant pandas to set foot in the
United States in nearly 20 years. At
red-carpet welcoming ceremonies,
first lady Pat Nixon became the
first, but not the last, to enthuse
about “pandamonium.”

The thousands who came to see
the animals that first weekend
stood in cold rain for up to an hour
for a 15-second glimpse. The zoo
put on extra security, fearful that:
someone might jump in the panda
yard and try to play with them.

“They are so sweet and cuddly
and lovable that you just want to

'pick them up and hug them and

squeeze them — and they’ll beat the
hell out of you if you do,” one offi-
cial warned.

These days the aging pandas
. just eat and sleep. There is none of
the play that characterized their
youth, and the last time they
seemed to have any real fun togeth-
er was in the summer of 1984, when
they cavorted “like cats” on new ex~
ercise equipment. Their lethargy
likely will be forgiven if they pro-
duce a surviving cub.

“I would love to get the chance
to look at'maternal behavior,” Ms.
Kleiman said. .

 




Colorado’s bounty of animals a peckcr’s p

By Joanne Ditmer
Denver Post Staff Writer
00K! There’s a' deer!

Each time we catch a
glimpse of Colorado’s abun-
dant wildlife is as exciting
as the last. Both children

and adults are delighted when they
spy an unusual bird or animal on
the landscape. We take thousands
of rolls of film and stare hopefully
at the hillsides when we’re in the
mountains and the plains, eager to
spot these elusive creatures.

Viewing pleasure

An estimated 2 million Colora-
dans and many of the 23 million
tourists who visit each year are
“passive” users of wildlife — that
is, they watch animals for the sim-
ple pleasure of it. This is in addi-
tion to the well over 1 million
sportsmen who support wildlife
management through fees for 1i-
ceases to fish or hunt.

“Colorado has every-thing -- big
game, absolutely world-class bird
watching in the San Luis Valley -—-
ibis to ducks, 22,000 sandhill
cranes, sometimes a whooping
crane,” said James Ruch, who
headed the state Division of Wild-
life until recently.

“And I don’t know of a sight in
the world more thrilling than a
flight of Canada geese over your
roof at dawn or dusk, honking as
they fly by.”

In the early 19005, there were
about 5,600 elk, 8,000 deer and 1,000
antelope in the Colorado.

Animals thrive
Now. there are about 150,000 elk,

 

’ll‘lE DENVER POST - July 16, 1988

Chase Swift .

COYO'IE: This sly critter may be seen along Plains waterways.

500,000 deer and 60,000 anteIOpe, as
well as 2,000 bighorn sheep. Moose
have been introduced, as have
pheasant and bobwhite quail, des-
ert bighorn sheep, river otter and
the Rocky Mountain goat. There
are 747 non-game species in the
state.

With the public’s growing inter-
est 1n mind, Colorado Division of
Wildlife officials last year started

 

the Watchable Wildlife Program
run by Robert llerbrode, a biolo-

gist who for eight yearswas in

charge of the division’s big—game

program.

“For the last 15 to 20 years the
percentage of people who hunt is a
smaller and smaller percentage of
the total pepulation, though there
are more hunters in numbers.
Fishing has held its own,” llern-
brode said. “What is growing are
numbers of persons who feed the
birds, who photograph birds and
animals, who take trips for the pri-

aradisc

mary purpose to see the wildlife.
People hunger -—— hunger —- to see
wildlife . . . because wildlife repre-
sents quality of lif e to us.” ,

More than 65 percent of Colora-
dans make active efforts to watch
wildlife, according to a recent.
state survey. About 74 percent of
outdoor sportsmen place the high-
est value on the outdoor recreation
experience, with less emphasis on
the bagging of game or fish.

Likely locations
The Watchable Wildlife Program
can give you advice on where to
see certain wildlife in its native en-
vironment and how to identify and
learn about the various species. ()f—
ficials also hope the program will
build a constituency of persons
who want the protection of wildlife
to continue as a high priority.
llernbrode has high hopes for
the program. He wants to develop
viewers’ guides that people can use
to learn what wildlife can be found
in areas around the state, how to
find it. and the best time of day to
look. He also plans to writes spe-
cialized brochures on a single sub-
ject, such as elk watching, bighorn
sheep, bird watching.

The Wildlife Division is about
the fifth largest landowner in the
state, and llernbrode Wants to use
some of the state sites specifically
for observing wild animals, offer-
ing interpretive programs so peo-

ple could go to an area to see cer— ‘«

Zoo veterinarian treats everything from snakes to apes

By Carol Trujillo

Staff Writer

Sometimes Sherri Huntress’ job is a bar-'
rel of monkeys.

Her first patients one day last week
were Josh, Jake, Sara and baby Jedi, a
rowdy pack of dusky leaf monkeys who
were due for yearly physicals.

Dr. Huntress, one of the Dallas Zoo’s two
staff veterinarians, examined the wiry
creatures from end to end, checking their
teeth for cavities, testing their blood for tu-
berculosis and swabbing their bottoms in
search of parasitic disease.

Rounds also took her face to fang with
the scaly residents of the 200’s reptile.

house, inside the mouth of a Bolivian grey
titi monkey and into the bedroom of two
not-so—amorous giraffes.

She also got personal with a pair of
plumheaded parakeets from India and a
suni antelope from southern Africa.

A typical day’s work brings Dr. Hunt-
ress, 33, closer to the wild side than a Satur-
day night stroll through Deep Ellum.
Along with head veterinarian Bonnie Ra-
phael, Dr. Huntress tends to the growls and
whimpers of the 200’s 1,500 animals.

The veterinary staff also oversees the
kitchen, a bustling place where meals for
the 200’s 374 species are prepared twice a
day, year round.

The veterinarians’ routine at the zoo
parallels a medical doctor’s at a hospital.
Using daily reports from zookeepers on the
health and behavior of the animals, they
compile patient lists.

Then they use equipment and methods
similar to those of medical doctors —— X-ray
machines, big needles and a warm bedside
manner.

A 200 veterinarian must typically com-
plete a two- to three-year residency caring
for exotic animals after a four-year veteri-
nary degree program.

But Dr. Huntress, whOse uniform is

to use binoculars as a stethoscope.

One of her patients last week was
Little Ricky, a Bolivian grey titi
monkey, about the size of a cat, with
gum problems.

Parasites have moved into Little
Ricky’s mouth, making it difficult
for the tiny tree-dweller to chew his
monkey chow.

Treatment was simple and sooth-
ing: Dr. Huntress gently swabbed
out Little Ricky’s raw mouth and
squeezed in salve.

Little Ricky shares a room at the
zoo hospital with a herd of suni an-
telopes. The petite animals aren’t
ailing, though. They’re part of the
200’s 3-year-old breeding project
with Texas A&M University and the
National Zoo in Washington, DC.

The herd includes S-week-old ET-
1, the world’s first offspring from a
non-surgical embryo transplant in
small hoofstock, and her surrogate
mother, H4. ~

Much of the veterinarians’ work
is observation. Hands-on treatment
requires capture and sedation and
can be risky for the patient —— and
the veterinarian.

So Dr. Huntress frequently
makes diagnoses with binoculars.
For instance she spied a blue-
winged goose splashing in the flam-
ingo pond, oblivious to its odd pro-
file. The tip of one wing turned up
in a perpetual salute.

The goose had “airplane wing”

. -——— a common ailment among birds

in captivity, Dr. Huntress said. The

bird’s wingtip feathers had simply

outgrown the rest of the wing feath-
ers, creating an imbalance. It’s
nothing a temporary bandage won’t
straighten out.

Next, she peeked in on Tillie and
Tano, two reticulated giraffes
paired for breeding.

They’d been sequestered from
their suite mates, but they acted as
if it were a first date. Plus, the awk-
ward pair didn’t have much pri-
vacy: Two docents with watches, bi-
noculars and clipboards were
posted outside their pen to monitor .
their performance.

After seesawing for hours be-
tween lust and laziness, the lovers
simply weren’t serious about sex,
Dr. Huntress decided. (Zoo vets are
sex therapists as well as surgeons.)

Dr. Huntress’ surgical patients ;
have ranged up and down the evo- '
lutional ladder, from snakes to apes.

Earlier this year, reptile keepers
noticed that a female black-headed ;
python had begun to resemble a
string of pearls. Unsightly, unex-
plained lumps were wrecking the
Australian snake’s shape. ‘

X-rays revealed mysterious
lumps too round to be eggs. Ms.
Huntress performed exploratory
surgery.

The voracious snake had swal-

lowed round, fist-size rocks that

still had traces of rats —- a python
entree.

But that’s all in a typical day’s
work.

“It‘s difficult,” she said. “There
are so many different animals. But
every day is different.”

 

 




Texan Leads Drive to Save R3 t 1761'

By LISA BELKIN

Special to T he New York T imes

AUSTIN, Tex. -— Jim Seippel, a button down com-
puter executive who works out of a white— walled office
in a concrete industrial park, is waging a drive to save

4 his favorite wild animal. He is not having much luck.

“it’s hard to get people to care about rattle:

snakes,” he said.“ “They’re not cute or cuddly and.

they’re more popular dead than alive.”

This puzzles Mr. Seippel, whohas been mesmer-
ized by all forms of snakes and reptiles since he was a
child. His parents, he remembers, “did their bestto
make me afraid, telling me that snakeswere the
Devil’s handiwork." He now owns 15 snakes and liz-
ards, to the delight of his own four children His office
wall displays a bumper sticker that proclaims: ”i Q?
My Snake. ”

Mr. Seippel is the founder of the Greater San An-
tonio Herpetological Society, with 80 members from
the Austin- San Antonio corridor who share his love of
reptiles. The group does more than campaign to save
rattlesnakes. They hold a yearly convention, where
members are instructed to leave their snakes at
home. “This is not a pet show,” Mr. Seippel said. “We
are educated, scientific conservationists.” The group
also lobbies against fishermen who catch turtles in
their nets while fishing for shrimp.

Commercial Markets

Recently, however, rattlesnakes —— specifically
"Texas diamondbacks -— have become their main
cause. in 1986 and again in 1987, rattlesnake mer—
chants purchased 400, 000 to 500, 000 of the reptiles
from hunters for about $50 each. The meat is served
as a delicacy in restaurants nationwide. The gall blad-
ders are sent to the Orient, where they are thought to
be an aphrodisiac. The skins are used to sate the
American passion for things Western - in belts,
boots, hatbands and such specialty items as clear
plastic toilet seats with baby rattlers coiled within.

clock. For those careless enough to be bitten, there is a

“Big macho men, wrestling with snakes,” Mr.

. Seippel said. “But these snakes have been gassed,

starved and are lethargic because of the cold spring
weather.” Those who promote the roundups describe
them as educational forums to teach children the dan-
gers of poisonous snakes, he said, adding, “The only
educational value 1 see is if you’re a student of abnor-
mal psychology."

Drive to Change Status

With the help of nearly two dozen other environ-
mental groups, the Greater San Antonio Herpetologi—
cal Association has started a letter-writing campaign
to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department asking

that reptiles and amphibians be elevated to the status .
of game animals with limits on the number of snakes :

snakes. “They are poisonous, they don’ t belong in resi- .

dential areas,” he said. “Anyone who finds one in their ’~' '~

backyard and wants to kill it, that’s fine. But i don’t
think trashing the wild should be a business.”

Mr. Seippel concedes that he and his fellow herpe-
tologists cannot prove that therattlesnake roundups
are damaging the environment. Studying rattle-
snakes, he notes, is not the highest priority of any gov-
ernmental or scientific institution. “The Parks and
Wildlife office is underfunded and overworked,” he
said.

But he remembers a time when Texas dens held

as many as 500 snakes each. “You just don’ t see that'

anymore, ” he said, adding that now most dens hold
but a few dozen. A decline that dramatic, he warns,
might have a domino effect on the ecosystem. For in—
stance, rattlesnakes kill mice for food. With fewer rat—
tiesnakes, ranchers may soon be plagued, with more
mice.

Meat of the snakes are killed in the desert, where .

hunters spray gasoline deep into rocky crevices and
than Wait for the snakes to escape from the fumes.
Some are killed immediately, when they are lifted by
the back at the neck with metal tongs, breaking the
delicate spine, Mr. Seippel says. The rest are taken to
rattlesnake roundups, family events popular in Texas
and Oklahoma.

Mr. Seippel has prepared a slide show of such
roundups, complete with sarcastic commentary. One
picture shows a central pit of captive rattlesnakes, an—

' other a booth at which $5 buys the right to chop off a
,rattlesnake’s head. There are contests to see how
many snakes can be coiled on an entrant’s head before

they fall off and how few stomps it can take to kill a .

snake.
. The main attraction is the bagging contest, where
entrants stuff snakes into a burlap sack against the

The groups are also writing letters to the Tulsa

headquarters of the National Jaycees. Most of the ;

roundups are sponsored by local J aycee chapters.
The Jaycees have written back, saying the round-
ups are not illegal and are at the discretion of each in-

dividual chapter. They invited Mr. Seippel to join the .

Jaycees.

But membership is limited to those under the age J

of 40, and Mr. Seippel IS a few months too old.

Poachedjaguar, puma and ocelot skins. seized by. Brazilian forwe$try agents A it A

Poachers threaten future of _
Brazilian wildlife haven

By Charles Clover
in Cuiaba, Brazil

THOUSANDS of skins from
jaguars, pumas, ocelots and
alligators illegally killed in
the Pantanal, one of the rich-
est wildlife havens in South
America, are to be burned
this week by judicial order.
Poaching is rife in the Pan-
tanal. the world’s largest wet-
land. The skins pictured left are
only a small part of a seven-
month haul captured from poach-
ers by agents of Brazil’s Forestry

’ Police. The burning is to prevent

their sale.
The Pantanal, which lies in the
thinly populated Brazilian states

of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso ‘

do Sul, extending into Bolivia
and Paraguay, still harbours
hundreds of rare birds, crab-eat-
ing foxes, jaguars, marsh deer,
capybaras (the world’s largest
rodent), anteaters and highly
endangered giant otters. '

But species valuable for their
skins, such as the jaguar, ocelot,
otter and cayman (the small local
species of alligator), are under
increasing pressure in Brazil’s
worsening economic climate.

An estimated two million alli-
gators were illegally killed for
their hides last year. A side effect
of this is an increase in the pira-
nha ﬁsh population, which is
causing concern to the Brazilian
Institute for Forestry Develop-
ment, IBDF, which polices the
huge region.

Cayman skins are regarded as
low-value products by the
leather trade, which pays only £3
for them in Brazil and £18 over

the border in Bolivia. But £3 is a
significant amount in Brazil,
where the minimum wage is £24 a
month.

Brazilian. police believe there
is a ﬂourishing trade in Bolivia
involving the exchange of cay-
man skins for cocaine.

Forestry police in Mato Grosso
state seized 400 weapons in four
months last year. Armed anti-
poaching patrols, however, meet
increasingly violent resistance,
largely because penalties for
poaching have been increased.

Senhor Antonio Nunes Boer-
boom, an IBDF agent operating
from Cuiaba, said that in a 15-day
blitz which has just begun, the
patrol expects to catch perhaps
10 poachers.

 

 
 

800 Miles

 

The agents, he said, are guided i

to their quarry by the sight of
circling vultures, and by instinct.
Most of the time, however, they
make their swoops at night.
Agents of the lBDF complain
that they are severely under-
staffed and underpaid. There are

20 agents in Mato Grosso and '

 

 

ﬂ“

only seven in the Mato Grosso do
Sul covering the Pantanal. an
area of 56,000 square miles.

The agents also complain of
the inefﬁciency and corruption
of the state police who, they say,
are often worse than useless in
the Pantanal.

Mr Douglas Trent, an Ameri-
can naturalist who runs tourist
trips to the Pantanal. agreed.
“The IBDF people are ﬁghting
an uphill battle, and are in dan-
ger of losing morale,” he said.

There are other threats to the
Pantanal at least as serious as
poaching: the building of dykes
in the hope of holding back ﬂood-
ing, pesticides, deforestation
leading to erosion and the silt-
ing-up of rivers.

Cyclical flooding, expected
every decade or so, was worse
than ever this year. The mayor of
Corumba, Senhor Hugo Silva da
Costa, said recently that the
Paraguay River rose 22 feet this
year, seven feet beyond the level,
at which trees are submerged
and animals are drowned.

Senhor Silva da Costa, who in'
April declared a state of emer-f
gency in Corumba, said he:
believed that the changes were
directly linked to human
activity.

it’s not quite ‘Late Night’ fare,
but pets strut stuff at beneﬁt

By Darcy Scott

 

OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

 

The dog days of summer ap—
proached at the Dallas SPCA
beneﬁt Sunday as pets attempted
their zaniest tricks and owners
revealed how well they were
trained.

The Dallas Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals’
Third Annual Texas Dog Day Af—
ternoon Benefit drew more than
700 visitors to the downtown Hil-
ton Hotel where pets participated
in a fashion show, a Stupid Pet
Tricks contest and ran a relay
race.

The fashion show displayed
the latest in #anine confections
for discriminating dogs. The ani-
mal apparel came from leading
doggie designers such as “Haut
hog,” whose clothing is “de-
signed for the complete canine.”

A pink leather dress, trimmed
with lace and rhinestones, price
tag $175, came from the Unleash
Me Leathers line. And for colder
weather, miniature poodles Man-
drade and Andy Cobb paraded
reversible leather coats lined
with faux cheetah fur for the
crowd. The show ended with the
ultimate formal wear. tuxedos,

for the males and a summer
wedding dress with pearl detail—
ing for a portrait of bridal finery.

For the pet trick contest, the
stage held the famous and the
flops. Rudy, a basset hound with-
previous film credits, did not fol»
low his advance billing and drink
champagne out of a glass, instead
he glad~handed with children on
the front row of the crowd.

Hanna, an owner-proclaimed
mutt, dutifully rode on her own-
er’s back as the owner crawled
around the stage.

Some canines ended up in the
dog house when stage fright pre~
vented perfect performances. Bo—
gey T. Divot let his master, Cine
dy George, down when he
relieved himself on the stage cur—
tain rather than doing a flip in
midair. George said the two years
of training obviously did not pay
off.

The winning pooch, Snickers,
a Chesapeake Bay retriever, stole
a beer can from a cooler across
the stage. Owners Blair and
Duana Redford said they trained
him to get beers at the lake or
beach.

“She is really smart,” Duana

 

Bedford said. “We just started
training her to bring the cordless
phone and she brings it right to
us.”

Snickers will be resting on her
laurels, not following the path of
fame and fortune.

“We‘re just going to take her
home,” Bedfor‘l said. '

Most of the contestants Were
dogs. The only cat in the contest,
Snoopy, took a little coaxing. His
owner, Edna McShan, got him to
wash his ears when she told him
they were dirty. l

Contest judge and animal tal—
ent agent Chere Hickock said she
enjoys judging this contest each
year but doesn’t sign too many
contracts at the end of the show.

“Most of this is not saleable,”
she said.

anatee slang

 

fer

runs a record pace

By TOM HENRY
Tribune Staff Writer

CRYSTAL RIVER — Florida’s
endangered manatees died at a re-
cord pace during the first six
months of 1988 and boating acci-
dents continued to be among the
leading causes of death.

According to statistics supplied
by the Department of Natural Re-
sources, 80 manatees died from
January through June. That figure
represents a 38 percent increase
over the 58 manatee deaths report-
ed during the same six-month peri-
od last year.

The information said that of the
80 deaths reported in the first half
of 1988, 26 were boat-related. Com-
paratively there were 16 manatee
deaths related to boating accidents
in the first half of 1987, and a re-
cord 39 were killed by boats during
the year.

“More
and more
people
are usin-
; gless and

less water,” said Patrick Hagan,
manager of the US. Fish and Wild-
life ServiCe’s Crystal River National
Wildlife Refuge, where 200 of the
nation’s 1,200 manatees spend the
winter. DNR officials said they be-
lieve the total population has re-
mained relatively stable for several
years.

Natural causes that affect new-
born and manatee calves killed 15
manatees in the first half of 1987
and 30 for the year. Twenty young
manatees died from natural causes
during the first six months of 1988.

Other factors contributing to the
record pace this year include cold
weather stress, injuries to manatees
entangled in crab trap lines and in-
juries caused when the animals
were pinned or crushed by gate
locks, biologists say.

Harassment also indirectly can
lead to the death of young calves if
females become so frightened they
swim away from their offspring,
said U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokes-
man Glenn Carowan, a Jackson-
ville-based biologist.

But David Carson, a DNR biolo-
gist in Fort Myers, said officials are
not sure why some natural factors,
such as the rising infant mortality
rate, are killing off the species.

If the current pace is main-
tained, 160 manatees will die this
year. The single-year record for the
Southeast and the Caribbean is 130

deaths in 1984, 128 of which were in
Florida.

Environmentalists increasingly
are concerned about the rising num-
ber of manatees crushed or run
over by boats.

The increasing number of
deaths caused by boats does not
mean idle-speed zones on 22 water-
ways throughout Florida, designed
to curtail injuries to manatees by
boats, have failed, Carowan said.

Records show the most preva-
lent areas for manatee deaths in the
past are Brevard, Collier, Lee and
Duval counties.

In 1987, Brevard led the state
with 22 manatee deaths, six of
which were attributed to boating ac-
cidents. In the first half of 1988, 12
manatees have died there, four of
which were attributed in boats.

In the north central part of the
state, Collier County and neighbor-

ing Lee County —— the region of the
state where the largest manatee
sanctuary is located -— had 11 and
10 manatee deaths respectively in
1987.

Six deaths in Collier and three
in Lee were attributed to boating
accidents. In the first half of this
year, 10 manatees have died in C01-
lier, three of which were boat-relat-
ed, and nine manatees have died in
Lee, five of which were boat-relat-
ed, statistics show.

Duval County, which includes
Jacksonville, had 13 manatees
deaths last year, five blamed on
boats. In the first half of 1988 the
county has recorded five manatee
deaths, two of which were boat-re-
lated.

In Citrus County, the fourth larg-
est manatee sanctuary in Florida,
six manatees died last year. None
were boat-related. For the first half
of 1988, six have died, one of which
was boat-related.

' director of the Humane Society, who, in a
masterful demonstration of understate-
_ ment, found the disciplinary measures
taken against Dunda only “harsh,” and not
prosecutable.

Thanks go, especially, to Betty Jo Wil-

liams, president of the San Diego Zoological

ociety who, having expressed the confi-
_. g‘dence of the society in the “professional-

1:;I‘ism” of the Wild Animal Park’s trainers

“professional standards of care we . . .
. bring to our elephant herd," brings a new
meaning to the words “professional stand-
ards”) has bounded past Lee’s understate-
' ment,‘ leading one to believe that Williams
may yet remain oblivious as to which event
‘ she is commenting on.
As for Alan Roocroft’s (supervisor in
charge of elephants at the Wild Animal
Park) values and sensitivities, I would not
wish to meet him in a dark alley. Too bad,
Lisa Landres (elephant keeper at San
Diego Zoo), that you and your co-workers
must continue to work under such condi-
tions. Kudos to you for speaking out.

A final thanks to you all, and your ilk,
admitted or not, prosecutable or not,
“professionals” or not, for changing my
feelings about zoos and animals held
captive for the public’s “viewing pleasure.”
I will never again visit the San Diego Zoo
nor the Wild Animal Park.

Perhaps the trainers were “cleared” by
the mercurial and elusive authorities, but
never by those of us whose sensibilities
have been abused as unforgivingly by
. Dunda's story as was the animal herself.
Say, Dunda, let’s appeal. -

1720 Washington Post .

. WASHINGTON - One had been
nudging the other’s neck and tick-
ling an ear opening with a tongue.
The other had been demurely
climbing the wall. But it wasn’t un-
‘til its two Komodo dragons took an
amorous roll in the simulated Indo-
nesian mud bank Thursday that the
; National Zoo could say for sure that
* its rare giant lizards are “most
probably” male and female.

“We got lucky,” a delighted Dale
ﬁarcellini, curator of reptiles and
:amphibians, said as he watched
~ {Friendty mate with Sobat. “At least
*they’re showing interest, which is
, pretty neat. How long did we have
' the pandas before they did

anything?” _

The 200’s newest residents,
whose exhibit officially opened
Thursday, are the only pair of Ko-
modo dragons on public view in the
Western Hemisphere. The dragons,
the largest species of lizards on
earth, conjure up images of what
life might have been like during
prehistoric times.

Komodo dragons are considered
an endangered species. Except for
the few that have been put in zoos,
the lizards — which grow to be 10

feet long and weigh 200 pounds _,

are found only on six small islands
in the 3,200-mile-long Indonesian

archipelago.
Friendty and Sobat, about 6

 

years old, are'gifts from Indonesia.
They were presented as a male and
female pair, but it is difficult to tell
a lizard’s sex, and officials were re-
luctant to anesthetize the animals
and X-ray them for a closer look.

The lizards, who could live to be
‘ 35 to 50, arrived at the zoo May 12;
and were kept in separate holding:

cells while ofﬁcials made sure each

was healthy. They were reintro-

duced and ensconced in a special
enclosure behind the Reptile House
on Wednesday. .

The enclosure is said to be the
“hottest exhibit we have,” Marcel-
lini said, because the coldblooded
dragons like it that way.

NEW YORK TIMES - July 24, 1988

7 Deadly

By PHILIP SHABECOFF

Special to The New York Times

MOUNT MITCHELL, NC, July

19 -— Thousands of dead trees,
their barren trunks and branches
stark against a hazy sky, stand like
an army of skeletons as far as the

.. eye can see along the crest of this
mountain.

Five years ago a red spruce for—
est covered the top of Mount Mitch-
ell, the highest. mountain east of
the Mississippi. Today, only rasp-
berry and blackberry bushes,
clumps of sedge and a few young
trees, brown and dying, cover the
ground near the summit.

This stark evidence is forcing
many scientists to accept a conclu-
sion that seemed only a possibility
five years ago: air pollution, in-
cluding acids in the air, is combin-
ing with natural stresses to cause
heavy damage to forests through
out the East.

“What you see here is happening

Dr. Bruck said the damage he is
seeing on 6,684-foot Mount Mitchell
seems similar to the early stages
of the mass destruction of forests
in recent years incentral Europe.

Dr. Bruck and the other scientists.
inteviewed said that the role of air
pollution in killing the trees was
'still a hypothesis rather than a
scientific fact. But-virtually all con-
tended that prudence dictated action.
Of most serious concern, the scien-
tists said, are ozone and acidity in

'clouds, rain, snow and dust. Ozone is
. formed at ground level by the reaction
of sunlight with manmade pollutants
1 from automobile exhaust, industry and
'3 a variety of small sources.

While ozone in the upper atmosphere

- shields the earth from damaging ultra-
iﬁviolet radiation from the sun, ground
level ozone contributes to smog, respi-
ratiory damage to people and damage

"to trees and crops. Acid rain, clouds,

‘ snow and dust are formed when pollu-

tants, chiefly oxides of nitrogen and

.sulfur from coal-fired power plants,

 

all along the crest of the Appala-
chians from Maine to Georgia,”
said Prof. Robert I. Bruck of North
Carolina State University, a plant
pathologist.

Dr. Bruck observed early symp-
toms of the decline of Mount Mitch-
ell’s spruce and fir five years ago.
Now the ecological system at the
summit has collapsed, he said.

‘Canary in the Coal Mine’

Dr. Bruck said he was “90 per-
cent certain" that manmade air
pollution traveling from the Ohio
and Tennessee valleys, particu-
larly low-level ozone and acidic
moisture in clouds, was combining
with such natural stresses as the
high temperatures and drought of
recent years to create an environ-

.travel through the atmosphere. Acid

' rain has been found by scientists to be

the Northeast and Canada.
But while the ill effects of these pollu-
tants have been documented, scientists
say it is difficult to separate their influ-
ence from climate or other possible
factors. The problem is complicated by
the fact that scientists only began in-
tensive studies of forests a decade ago.

‘We Should Not Wait’

sity of New York at Albany, who has:

iéaomic and technological solutions to

inﬁrm time, decrease emissions of sulv

There is also growing evidence that
gair pollution may be damaging or slow-
fiug the growth of trees in other parts of
ithe country, according to DaVid _L.
ggkadloff, a United States Forest SerVice

Opinion Has Evolved

Forest Service officials had been ex-
tremely skeptical until recently “that
air pollution might play a Significant
role in slowing the growth of trees and
damaging forests. Dr. Radloff said that
the evidence linking the declining
health of forests and the high levels of

But the discovery in the past couple

that clouds could be significantly more

So far, the effects are chiefly vis-
ible at high altitudes, where natu-

ral stresses are greatest and acidic
clouds are nearest. But a number
of scientists who believe that high
levels of air pollution are instru-
mental in destroying coniferous
forests at high altitudes in theEast
also expressed another fear in in-
terviews over the past few days.

They warned that the death of
the mountaintop spruce and fir for-
ests might be what several of them
called “the canary in the coal
mine” - an early warning that for- '
ests of low altitudes, including
hardwood forests, are also in dan-
ger of being damaged by a combi-
nation of man-made and natural
stresses.

{hf the country. . - . _,
, Dr. El-Ashry also said the deaths of
trees reflected the end of a long pro-
»cess reflecting the accumulated stress

{ides “By the time we see visible dam- . '-

Acid air pollution and ozone, Dr. El
Ashry said, had been found to weake
trees to the point where “they canno

, such as frosts, high winds, insects an
‘ disease.”

He also said the group’s researcher

. Scientific Disagreement

Not all those with an immediate

air pollution is a threat to the nation’s
forests. Robert C. Kaufman, director of

“Those mountain tops sit in a chemi-

acid deposition, which puts them under
continual stress. It is starting to 100k as
if those stressed systems are snapping
like rubber bands.”

The soup has been especially potent
on the top of Mount Mitchell in this hot,
dry summer. It is widely agreed, Dr.
Bruck said, that ozone levels of 55 parts
per billion in the air are enough to
cause physiological damage to spruce
and fir trees. Measurements taken by
his research team, he reported, have
shown that since May 1, ozone levels
have been above that level 90 percent
of the time; more than 120 parts per

Strickland’
clou

 

 

 

By AnthonyE. Heffeman

Atlanta Bureau .

ATLANTA — Terry Maple, director of Zoo
Atlanta, is still amazed at the inﬂuence of
Robert Strickland.

“Unbelievable,” Maple
‘ , sighs, recalling how

510618)” Strickland spearheaded a
proves $5 million corporate gift-
smart giving campaign four

years ago to upgrade the
46' zoo, then at its nadir. “He
raised almost $6 million,”
said Maple.

For Strickland, it was business as usual in
his role as chairman and chief executive offi-
cer of Atlanta’s largest banking company,
SunTrust Banks Inc. As a leading proponent
of the Atlanta business community‘s heri-
tage of enlightened self-interest, he quickly
enlisted other corporate leaders in the cause,
including Roberto C. Goizueta of Coca-Cola
Co., John L. Clendenin of BellSouth Corp, T.
Marshall Hahn of Georgia-Pacific Corp. and
others of similar stature.

“With a group like that, it’s not hard to go
over your goal,” said Lisa Gerardi of Alex-
ander and O’Neill, a firm that devised the
public fund-raising campaign for the zoo.

“It was incredible to see the networking
get going,” said Maple. Thanks to the corpo-
rate fund-raising, the Atlanta zoo has
evolved from being a public embarrassment
to a source of civic pride.

“Bob Strickland is the epitome of the cor—
porate leader,” said Dan E. Sweat, a former
president of Central Atlanta Progress, a
powerful downtown business-civic group.
Sweat notes that Strickland’s father was
SunTrust’s president in the 19405, and, there—
fore, he grew up in an atmosphere of com—
munity involvement. “Nobody ever had to
explain to him that you had to do your civic
duty as well as your professional duties.”

Strickland’s biography lists 20 profession-
‘ al and civic affiliations, including chairman

.., , -. a of the board of trustees of Emory University,
KELLY WILKINSN . DNLYNEVt ‘ past Chalman 0f the Atlanta Arts Alliance
. - , - and past vice president of Atlanta Rotary.
Robert Stnckland heads Georgza s largest bankzng company, Sun Trust. a; “ His motivation to take all this on is simple:
“Without a healthy community, you can't
have a healthy bank.”

Bank soundness and the profitability that
flows from it is Strickland’s top priority.
This is what enabled SunTrust to become
Atlanta’s largest bank holding company with
operations outside of Georgia in Florida

executive officer of SunTrust’s predecessor

based peers.

The company’s strength is the underpin-
ning of Strickland’s influence throughout the
community, said Sweatt, the former CAP
head who is now President of CF Foundation
Inc., a private philanthropical group. “As
head of the big bank in town, he’s going to be
very active,” said Sweatt.

For example, last September, Strickland,

Pets cause stir in Sugar Land .

Baboons gettemporary reprieve

By Bill Hansel Jr.
OF THE HOUSTON POST

 

SUGAR LAND —— A Fort Bend
County man may keep two ba-
boons he calls “family” until at
least Friday when a hearing on a
petition to remove the pets from
the man’s home is held, a judge

"i’r'uled Monday.

State District Judge Brady El-

‘ liott ruled that Sugar Land resi-
- dent Gerald Yoakum, 26, can con-

tinue to keep his pets Joshua and
Jason this week if he keeps them

_ caged.

The Fort Bend District Attor-
ney’s office filed a petition Mon-
day requesting the animals imme-
diately be removed from
Yoakum’s residence in the First
Colony subdivision. ,

The controversy oVer the ani-
mals began several weeks ago
when some neighbors complained

tion that drew about 20‘ names,

said Yoakum, a disc jockey who is

studying to be a helicopter pilot.
Neighbors have told the district

attorney’s office the baboons stink

and have been seen running loose

along a fence. in addition, some
neighbors have expressed fear for
the safety of their children and
pets, according to court docu-
ments. ‘ '

Baboons “have extremely pow-
erful jaws and teeth. . . .capable of
causing serious bodily harm and
injury to the residents” of Yoa-
kum's subdivision and Fort Bend
County, the documents state.

The Fort Bend County Com-
missioners’ Court last week found

that baboons are “wild animals,

not capable of domestication, in-
nately dangerous and in need of
control.”

That ﬁnding means the pets fall
under the Fort Bend County Ani-
mal Control Ordinance, officials
said. ,

Yoakum said he expects the

“These animals are not danger-

BOZEMAN, Mont. —— The presi-
dent of a national organization
pushing wolf recovery efforts in
the Northern Rockies says support
for reintroducing wolves in Yellow-
stone National Park is growing.
fj “I don’t think we’re far away at
all from seeing wolves in Yellow-

ﬁone,” said M. Rupert Cutler of ,

die Defenders of Wildlife, “but
We’re trying to be patient about
u 5’ _

The patient part includes efforts
to have a $100,000 compensation
fund in place so livestock owners
could be paid for losses to wolves,
support of a $200,000 congressional
appropriation for the National
Park Service to study the impacts
of wolf reintroduction, and educa-
tional projects about wolves and
humans.

Hank Fischer, Defenders field
representative in Missoula, said
the organization so far has raised
more than $15,000 for the compen-
sation fund. The total of $100,000
would be used over a 30year peri-
od, he said.

pport grows for wolves in Rockies

“We don’t expect ranchers’
losses to be high,” Cutler said. “
. . . But we’re willing to put our
money where our mouth is.”

The compensation program
worked well when ranchers lost
livestock to wolves near Glacier
National Park last year, he said.

Defenders of Wildlife is raising

the money from private sources.
But, once in place, the program
would be administered by divisions
of the Department of Agriculture
and Department of Interior.
Cutler also noted that recent po-
litical support from conservative
Republican Sen. James McClure of

Idaho will help the recovery effort.

some day be at least as famous
as Loni Anderson. I want them to
. receive lucrative offers for
major motion pictures based on
their True Life Adventures.

This week, for example, our
adventure is entitled: -

ZIPPY AND EARNEST GET
OPERATED ON

This adventure began when
Zippy went through puberty, a
biological process that a small
dog goes through in lesstime __,

The Denver Post / Ray Grumney

than it takes you to throw away
your third—class mail. One
minute Zippy was a cute
little-boy puppy, scampering

1 about the house playfully causing

permanent damage to furniture
that is not yet fully paid for; and
the next minute he was: A
Full-Grown Man.

Of course, in Zippy’s case,
“full-grown” means “the size of
a Hostess Sno-Ball, yet somehow
less impressive.” But in his own
mind, Zippy was a major stud
muffin, a hunk of burnin’ love, a
small—caliber but high—velocity
Projectile of Passion fired from
the Saturday Night Special of

Sex. And his target was:
Earnest.
Earnest is a female dog, but

‘ she was not the ideal choice for

Zippy, because all of her
remotely suspicious organs had
been surgically removed several
years ago. Since that time she
has not appeared to be'even
dimly aware of sex, or much of
anything else. Her lone hobby,
besides eating, is barking
violently at nothing. Also she is
quite large; when she’s standing
up, Zippy can run directly under
her with an easy 6 inches of
clearance. So at first we were
highly amused when he started

putting The Moves on her It was
like watching Tommy Tadpole

f hit on the Queen Mary.

But shortly the novelty wore

' off and we started feeling sorry

for Earnest, who spent the entire
day staring glumly off into dog
hyperspace while this tireless
yarn-ball— -sized Lust Machine

, kept leaping upon her,

sometimes getting as high as
mid-shin, and emitting these

. presumably seductive
high-pitched yips (“What’s your

Sign? What’s your sign?”). So we
decided it was time to have the
veterinarian turn the volume
knob of desire way down on the
stereo system of Zippy’s
manhood. If you get my drift.
The next morning Earnest was
limping, so we decided to take
both dogs to the vet. They
bounded enthusiastically into the
car, of course; dogs feel very
strongly that they should always
go with you in the car, in case
the need should arise for them to
bark violently at nothing right in
your ear. When we got to the
veterinarian’ 5 office they
realized they had been tricked
and went into Full Reverse
Thrust, but fortunately the floor
material there is slippery enough
to luge on. So when we last saw

Zippy and Earnest that morning,
they were being towed, all eight
legs scrabblin g in a wild,
backward, futile blur, into: the
Back Room.

When we picked them up that
night, they were a pair of hurtin’
COWpokes. Earnest, who had a
growth removed, was limping
badly, plus we had to put a
plastic bag on her leg so she
wouldn’t lick her stitches off.
And Zippy, to keep him from
getting at his stitches, was
wearing a large and very
comical round plastic collar that
looked liked a satellite dish with
Zippy’s head sticking out the
middle. He had a lot of trouble
getting around, because his
collar kept hitting things.

For the next week, if you
came to our front door, here’s
what happened: You heard the
loud barking of two dogs going
into Red Alert mode, but you did
not see any immediate dogs.
Instead you heard a lot of

bumping and clunking, which
turned out to be the sound of a
large dog limping frantically
toward you but suffering a major
traction loss on every fourth step
because of a plastic bag,
combined with the sound of a
very small dog trying
desperately to keep up but
honking his collar into furniture,

, doorways, etc. And then, finally,

 




skidding around the corner, still
barking, there appeared the
dynamite duo: Bagfoot and
Satellite Head.

During this week we were not
. the least bit worried about
burglars, because if anyone had
tried to break into our house, we
. would have found him the next
morning, lying in a puddle of his
own drool. Dead from laughter.

Debate grows
as ammals die
for research

By Hugh McCann
News Staff Writer

 

Of the '70 million live animals used in
scientific research in
the United States
each year, between
3,000 and 5,000 pass
through the Harper
Hospital basement
laboratory directed by Jeffrey Evelhoch.
Evelhoch, a chemist and researcher at
Wayne State University, and his ﬁve-mem—
ber team have been exposing mice to
high-energy magnetic and radio frequency

waves for four years to help find the best
treatments for cancer patients.

A National Family Opinion survey in
1985 indicated that that 77‘ percent of the
public supported the practice of using ani-
mals to help find treatments and cures for
human illness. The controversy has grown.
however, because more and more people.
alarmed by reports of mistreatment in lalio»
ratories, worry that animals are not treated
humanely during the research process.

Some critics have proposed a ban on illt
use of animals in research and testing: {35.
percent of the respondents to the sumsy
opposed such a ban.

THE USE of laboratory animals is
governed by the Animal Welfare Act, admin—
istered by the U.S. Department of Agricol-
ture. Two state agencies also have jlll‘iStilt-

‘ tion: the departments of Agriculture and

Public Health.

Animals die for

cancer research

 

From page 18

Federal and state inspectors make
unannounced visits to the Wayne
State campus several times a year to
check on the conditions of laboratory
animals, said Dr. Merlin E. Ekstrom,
a veterinarian and director of Wayne
State’s Division of Laboratory Ani-
mal Resources.

Evelhoch’s research is funded by
the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), so he follows NIH guidelines
for the care and use of his colony of
mice.

The NIH’s 83-page booklet “is
really the bible for laboratory-animal
use at. Wayne and most other institu—
tions,” Ekstrom said.

FOR RESEARCH on tumors,
mice are the animal most commonly
used, Evelhoch said.

A lab technician shaves a dime-
sized patch of hair off a mouse’s flank
and injects the bare skin with a
cancer. He then returns the furry,
dark-coated rodent to a breadbox-
size plastic container, where it lives
with about 20 other mice of its own
sex. A yellow label identifies the
container’s tenants, listing their vital
statistics and date of injection.

AFTER INJECTION, life goes

on as usual in the Animal Holding
Room, where, during any given week,
the total mouse population is about
100.

A week or two after a tumor is
planted, the cells have multiplied
rapidly into a noticeable lump, and
the mouse is ready for the next step
in the experiment: determining the
effects of magnetic and radio fre-
quency waves.

“We select maybe five mice at a
time, depending on the size and the
shape of the tumor,” Evelhoch said.
For taking measurements, “the per—
fect tumor is a sphere,” he said, “but
you seldom get a perfect one.”

The mice are under anesthetic
during much of the work. They are
placed in a Plexiglas cradle, which is
then inserted into a magnet.

When the mouse enters the mag-
net for the first time, it is free of
anticancer drugs. The first measure-
ment gives the researchers a baseline
reading of the energy absorbed by its
body. Later, a drug is injected into
the mouse, and new energy measure-
ments are taken.

The difference between the base-
line and later readings indicates the
mouse’s response to the drug.

THE TESTING, Evelhoch said.
is not painful for the mice.

“The only pain would be the pain
associated with the drug given to
them,” he said.

When a mouse’s tumor reaches a
weight of more than 2 grams, or'lO
percent of its body weight, the mouse

Special to The Dallas
Ferrets are slinky, playful creatures, but they also are tenaCious predators in the wild.

Black'footed ferrets thriving again

Wyoming program pulls mink’s cousin from brink of extinction

By Bob Diddlebock

CHEYENNE, Wyo. — Black-footed
ferrets, those slinky, playful little
creatures with Lone Ranger masks
that cover tiny green eyes, have
walked the tightrope of extinction
for several years.

But now, thanks to the Wyoming
Game and Fish Department, the
black-footed ferret may be making a
comeback, a development cheered
by many conservationists, wildlife
experts and Cowboy State residents
who’ve taken to the feisty furballs.

Since spring, 42 ferrets have been
born to 15 females at the Sybille Can-
yon Research Center northeast of
Laramie. Some 38 kits have survived
and the colony now numbers 62 in-
habitants — an accomplishment
that Larry Kruckenberg of the Wyo-
ming Game and Fish Department
calls “the conservation story of the
decade in this nation.”

In the wild, ferrets are stealthy,
tenacious predators with steel-trap
mouths who subsist mainly on prai-
rie dogs and grow to be about 2 feet
long and weigh 2 pounds.

Once widely found in 11 western
states from Canada to Mexico, they
started to disappear when prairie
dogs began .to fall prey to ranchers’

ﬂ

eradication efforts. By the late 19703,
the ferrets, which are members of
the mink family, were thought to be
extinct.

But in 1981, a 128-member colony
was found outside Meteetsee, Wyo., a
ranching community of 500 in the
state’s northwestern corner. After
canine distemper wiped out most of
those ferrets, the state moved the 18
survivors to the Sybille Canyon lab
in an effort to breed them, some-
thing never before accomplished in
captivity.

In the spring of 1987, those ef-
forts produced seven kits, each
about an inch and a half long and as
thick as a pencil at birth. This year’s
success can be traced to several fac-
tors, according to Dr. Tom Thorne,
the state veterinarian who directs
the ferret-reproduction program.
The animals have had another year
to adapt to their surroundings,
they’re used to humans handling
them, and they’ve responded well to
vitamin- and mineral-enriched di-
etS.

State officials, who say they’ve
spent about $2 million to save the
ferrets, have received only a few
complaints. Some outdoorsmen have
griped that wildlife money should

be spent on big-game efforts, while a
few environmentalists have de-
clared that man should take a
hands-off approach when it comes to
almost-extinct animals.

But game and fish officials argue

that the ferret recovery has height-

ened public awareness about threat-
ened and endangered species, which
now number 495 in the United
States. That figure also covers 46 spe-
cies in the eight-state Rocky Moun-
tain region, including the bald ea-
gle, whooping crane and the gray
wolf.

So far, the US. Fish and Wildlife
Service has saved the greenback cut-
throat trout, which was on its way to
extinction in Colorado’s Rocky
Mountain National Park. Peregrine
falcons, victims of pesticide poison-

ing, have been successfully bred in
captivity and released throughout
the Rockies.

This past spring, lab-bred red
wolves were released in North Caro-
lina. Efforts are also under way to
save the Wyoming toad, as well as to
relocate grizzly bears threatened by
development in Wyoming, Montana
and Idaho.

But no animal has touched the
good-news nerve the ferets have in
sparsely populated Wyoming. When
one of the critters -— be it Dexter,
Fennis, Sundance, Molly, Becky. Col-
lene or whoever ——-— is sick, it gene

erates headline coverage in. local
newspapers and on radio and televi-
sion. Indeed, when Dean underwent
root-canal surgery to stem an infec-
tion -— an operation that left him
with a gold cap on one tooth -- one
might have thought President
Reagan had moved the White House
to Cheyenne.

In Meteetsee —- the name comes
from the Shoshone Indians and
means “meeting place of the chiefs"
—- “ferret fever" has run high for
several years. One cafe offers “ferret
nuggets,” which are really tried

chicken bits. A now-defunct
women’s softball team called itself
the Ferrettes. Now, there’s talk of
producing a ferret video that tour-
ists could view in the local recre-
ation center.

“This is something that has put
the town on the map,” says Jim Ses-
sions, the town’s recreation direc-
tor. “There’s no reason why we
shouldn’t capitalize on something
that’s indigenous to the areas.”

Breeding the ferrets in captivity
is one thing, and Thorne hopes to

have 250 of them in the next three
years. But successfully reintroduc-
ing them into the environment —
which state officials hope to do by
1991 —— could be a tricky proposition.

For example, can enough suit-
able release sites be found through-
out the west, where rangeland 'is
dwindling? How many male and
female ferrets must be released at a
particular site to establish a colony?
Where are suitable prairie dog colo-
nies? Will the lab-raised ferrets be
able to hunt and kill their own prai-
rie dogs, find their own water, and

“‘There is a lot to worry about,
and the challenge will be just as
great as it was getting them bred,”
says Thorne, “But we’re a lot further
than we were two years ago when
we had no reason to believe that
we’d make it. So far, it’s been fasci-
nating.”

LOS ANGELES TIMES - July 21, 1988

For-Some, Summer Camp Is a Real Zoo

For kids enrolled in Los Angeles
Zoo Camp this summer, visiting the
tortoises, birds and gorillas is just one
part of their busy schedule. Songs,
arts and crafts, games—all with
wildlife themes—also are on the
agenda.

This is the second summer that the
zoo is running its camp, which
accepts 55 children each week for a
program that mixes African safari
and South American theme adven-
tures with introductory lessons on

world wildlife and the environment.

“It’s a combination of camp and
zoo activities,” said Cindy Richard-
son, a zoo spokeswoman. “The pro-
gram takes kids beyond just looking
at animals in a zoo setting to really
having a better understanding of
animals in the wild, their habitat,
interrelationships between animals
and the impact people have on
animals."

The camp has two sessions: one in
July for children ages 8 and 9 and the

 

 

second in August for children 10 and
11 and “graduates" of the first
session. Both sessions feature ani-
mal—keeper talks and a behind-then
scenes tour of a special animal
exhibit.

“They don't become junior keep-
ers, but they do gain an appreciation
for animals and a chance to look
behind [the] scenes,” Richardson
said. Zoo Camp is a project of the
Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn., a
nonprofit support group.

Celebrity White tiger will Visit
as stand-in for indisposed cousin

 

By John Beifuss
Staff Reporter

 

Flurrie the white tiger is not
coming to Memphis.

But don’t despair, exotic ani-
mal lovers: Taj the white tiger
arrives Monday, and goes on dis-
play Saturday morning at the
Memphis Zoo. She will be in
Memphis through Sept. 10.

Ta} replaced Flurrie because
the originally scheduled visitor
from Columbus, Ohio, may be
pregnant, said Don Winstel, gen-
eral curator of the Columbus
Zoo.

Taj -—- 3 years old and 300
pounds — is more of a celebrity,
anyway. She was the first white
tiger born in Columbus. As a
cub, she appeared on Late Night
with David Letterman and Th e
Today Show with Columbus Zoo
director Jack Hanna. And —-— as
the Columbus Zoo’s public rela-
tions department couldn’t resist
noting +- Taj has been on a ‘very
rich diet’: She once ate the dia-
mond out of an engagement ring
worn by Hanna’s wife, Suzi.

“Taj is a gentle, friendly ani-
mal to the people she knows, but
she has her likes and dislikes,”
Winstel said. “When she doesn‘t
like something, she’s not bash-
ful about letting you know.

 

She’ll roar and snarl and growl
and do tiger things.”

Taj, a Bengal tiger with some
Siberian tiger blood, is not
unique in one interesting way,
however. Like all the white ti-
gers in the world’s zoos and cir-
cuses, she is the descendant of a
single animal.

“Literally, they’re all descend-
ed from one white male,” said
Glenda Gilmore of Busch Gar-
dens in Tampa, Fla, which is

home to six white tigers.

White tigers have been in zoos
only since 1951, when a white
male was captured in a forest in
the Madhya Pradesh area of in»
dia. It is believed that all white
tigers originate from this forest.

This white Bengal tiger,
named ,Mohar, was mated with
other tigers, but no white babies
resulted. Eventually, Mohar was

mated with one of his daughters
—- and a major zoo attraction was
born. The relationship of Mohar
and his daughter produced 11
white cubs in four litters. The
white tiger population grew
from there, with the Cincinnati
Zoo being most successful in
breeding the cats.

White tigers are not albinos.
They have gray or chocolate-co-
lored stripes on white fur, and
blue eyes. Nor are they members
of a distinct species, like such
other white-furred animals as
polar bears and snow leopards.

Scientists believe the first
white tiger was a genetic mu-
tant: Something in the animal’s
genes triggered the white color:
ing. It passed on this characteris-
tic to some of its offspring.

Bengal and Siberian tigers are
endangered species. White ti-
gers, most of which are Bengals,
therefore are rare animals
which also are valued for their
attractiveness and popularity
with the public.

But because of their common
ancestry, white tigers are not
useful in strengthening the
bloodlines of the vanishing ti-
ger species.

, “They’re all so in-bred that
zoos are very, very careful about
who breeds to who, because
they’re all in some way related,”
Ms. Gilmore said. She said three
white tiger cubs were born at
Biisch Gardens this year.

, “They are a much more deli-
cate cat than the yellow Bengal.
Their genes make them weaker.
They have a rougher time at
birth.”

Currently,there are 275 Ben-
gal and 1,021 Siberian tigers in
captivity in 290 institutions,

 

mostly in the United States and :
Europe, according to a comput- i

g erized inventory of the Ameri-
can Association of Zoological
Parks and Aquariums. The
AAZPA inventory does not list

the number of white tigers.’

Whatever their origins, white
tigers hold a fascination for the
public. “Most of our guests tell
us they truly enjoy them,” Ms.
Gilmore said.

“They’re something that
seems to be popular as far as
loans,” Winstel said. “We’ve had
a lot of requests.” He said Mem-
phis was the first city to receive
a white tiger on loan from Co-
lumbus.

Taj is scheduled to arrive in
Memphis about 1:30 pm. Monday
aboard a Federal Express DCIO.
She will be accompanied by Co-
lumbus zookeeper Dan Hunt.

The first people, other than
zookeepers, to see Taj on display
will be Mayor Dick Hackett, the
members of the City Council,
and their families. These politi-
cal top dogs will view the big cat
during a preview party at 6:30
pm. Wednesday.

Memphis Zoological Society
members will get to see Taj dur-
ing preview parties at 7 pm.
Thursday and Friday.

The tiger exhibit officially
will be opened to the public at 10
am. Saturday by Hackett, who
worked out the loan with Colum-
bus Mayor Dana Rinehart. In ex-

change for Taj, the Memphis Zoo ;

will loan Columbus a pair of rare
Przewalski’s horses, which are
extinct in the wild. The wild
horses, native to Mongolia, will
be part of a special exhibition of
Chinese animals in Columbus.

The exhibition’s major spon-
sors are ScheringPlough Inc.,
Goldsmith’s, Federal Express,
Fantastic Sam’s, Super-Jock In-
door Horse Racing Inc., Coca-
Cola, and SPL/Ledic Manage-
ment.

Taj will be on display at the
Primate Building, in the exhibit
that was refurbished last year to
accommodate Xiu-Hua, the giant
panda on loan from the Chapul-
tepec Park Zoo in Mexico City. A
new metal-wire roof was put
over the outdoor part of the ex-
hibit to prevent Taj from leaping
the wall.

Memphis Zoo director Charles
Wilson said the tiger will not at-
tract the record-breaking
crowds that Xiu-Hua did, but
“we do expect a significant in-
crease in attendance.”

In addition, white tiger T-
shirts, posters and other souve-
nirs will be on sale. Proceeds
from most of these items will
benefit the Memphis Zoological
Society.

“The white tiger is a very
beautiful animal to be able to
display,” Wilson said. “We be-
lieve it will bring attention to
the need for an outdoor facility
for all our big cats.”

Zoo officials hope to begin ma-
jor fund-raising efforts in the
near future for “Cat Country,” a
state-of-the-art habitat for carni-
vores that would cost about $3.5
million, Wilson said.

Taj’s debut also marks the re»
opening of the Primate House,
which has been closed since the 3
spring for asbestos removal and 2
renovation. Each of the monkey
and ape exhibits has been re-
painted and equipped with new ,
branches and other pieces of ’
wood to climb. Kwashi
Tammy, two gorillas who regu- .,
larly live in the exhibit to be oc~
cupied by Taj, will remain on 5
loan at the Little Rock Zoo, along ‘
with the orangutans.
