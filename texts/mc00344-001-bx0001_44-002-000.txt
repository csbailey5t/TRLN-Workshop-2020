Bear Christine,

Thank you for your letter 2nd February and also for asking
Pat Farrell to forward information about freeze branding. It was very kind
of you and him/her ? for being so generous with information and photos of
the brands (markings) taken at varying times. (Will enclose my draft
acknowledgement to him/her -— please forgive its untidiness but I haven’t

a copier near by and want to get these letters posted today ~ so tear it up
after reading it).

It would be wonderful if freeze branding wa ' plemented ~ but
am not optimistic -— no~one seems to want to know about it. I've written
to several nesspapers - nothing has been published -~ instead we see frequent
references to the sacred cow' —— (enclosed) — I know of eight people who
have written to Janet -- not one letter has been acknowledged although we
do stress 'her family company' for legal reasons. I wonder if you could
possibly write to her - your organizations commands respect - and perhaps....
will receive a reply. Did I send the photos I tool from the 'Landline'
programme~- not good for publication, but the horror of the red hot iron
bearing down on the animal's face so near to the eye ~- and the face then in
flame. So dreadful but no doubt you have photos of your own.

Your wild Bird Conservation Act news is great -- congratulations
and let's hope the enemies of the Act will remain quiet. I do hope Silva
will be sentenced to many years behind bars -— then he will know what it is
like to be caged - if only for a little while ..... A new little stray
'budgie' I have taken in is quite a problem - she delights in chewing
wood and like substances --— she has chewed the book case and ther furniture
also the back of the TV which is quite dangerous because I ca ‘t keep that
draped all the time ~~ so she is limited to about two hours a day out of the
cage and only when I'm here. The other budgies are 0.K. and are out
most of the day -- we have 'butcher birds about here so can't leave them
(the budgies) in cages on the balcony which is unfortunate — the Australian
noisy miners are also aggressive towards caged birds -— there must be at least
a dozen native bird species here - lovely to see them - but the galahs are my
favourites - they have such personality.

Re koalas -~ on today's airways, rangers at Kangaroo Island -
a small island near Adelaide; S.A. recommended the culling of 2000 of the
5000 on the island - because they are killing all the trees and would slowly
starve to death..... he said they would be too:tressed if trans-located ...
howeverm you can imagine the furore..£ the N.S.w. Premier, Bob Carr said
he will negotiate to trans-locate them to N.S.W. - Victoria can‘t take any
because they have too many. Really, koala news is so conflicting -— they
may be in strife in northern N.S.W. and southern Queensland ~- but down south
over-population is the problem -— and the southern koalas are bigger than the
northern ones . If they can be Irahs ~located it would be great, but of
course bushufires are more of a problem up north ... anyhow, if anything is
published, I'll send it to you.

Must conclude Chris -- I went to Bargo to the 20th
Annual meeting of the 'Dingoes' .. very pleasant - about 30 dingoes there now
- all so healthy, and happy in large runs ----(but the Dingo remains 'noxious...')
With good wishes, and again many thanks,

3/

Dear Pat Farrell,

After reading the information and looking at the marking on the
photos, I feel sure ourCmeneyrhungry rich pastoralists will continue to resist the
slower freeze branding procedure an they are also likely to say that the lighter
coloured Brahman cross cattle are unsuitable for freeze brands. It seems to me
now that it was just a ploy to include ‘freeze branding' to get the face branding
law passed in the Northern Territory. Hot iron face branding is not allowed in
Australian States - and that is where most of the pastoralists companies are based.

When our President, Joan Papayanni wrote to the Managing Director of
Heytesbury Holdings 1n Perth about 12 monthsfagﬂygﬂhefgang her and confirmed that

Heytesbury Pastoral fire face brand (ea31er’ﬁhr seeing cattle coming up ramp off

have written to Janet Holmes a Court, but as far as we know, not one letter has
been acknowledged. I am hoping that people overseas may be prompted to write

to her suggesting freeze branding (?hint), or give some publicity to the cruel
fire face branding in Australia's north.

Dear Mrs Ford

Thank you for your letter of 21 February 1996 concerning face
branding in the Northern Territory.

Unfortunately we are not able to supply the information that you
request, as this Department does not keep a record of companies
that face brand cattle in the Northern Territory. This matter
is one for the relevant authorities in the Northern Territory
and as they have already indicated to you they do not have the
information you requested.

Yours sincerely

Letter to the Editor
'Sydney Morning Herald'

Dear Sir,
A news item (S.M;H. 5/1/96) reported that Australia's richest woman,
Mrs. Janet Holmes a Court has placed her family home in w.A. on the market.
As Mrs. Holmes a Court is respected by many for her good works, we
hope she might consider re-locating to Darwin.
There she may be able to influence her family company, Heytesbury Pastoral,
and other companies which export cattle via the Darwin Wharf to the Philippines,
to stop fire face branding -— an agonizing procedure.
(As seen on A.B.C. 'Landline‘ the animal bellows and its eyes bulge with

terror as the redehot iron bears down on its cheek and flames rise from its

.x‘
.

burning face.)

Fire face branding and freeze face branding became legal in the Nerthern
Territory mainly because the Filipino market requires unmarked hides. There-were

168,000 cattle exported to the Philippines in 12 months to the end of October, '95.

Presumably all were fire branded as, on recent information, no cattle are freeze

branded. .
In the 'state-ofethe art' cattle yards in N.T., is freeze branding too

difficult, too_expensive, or just ttoo considerate' for a non-human species?
TThos5'cattle out of sight, mind and scrutiny, are in need of help

from such an Australian luminary as Mrs. Janet Holmes a Court.

Yours faithfully,

MANLY MP Peter Macdonald’sb

push to legalise voluntary eutha-
nasia has received a boost'with
Premier Bob Carr promising to
support a vote along individual, and
not Labor Party lines, when the
controversial bill reaches Parlia-
_ ment.
I Mr Carr’s pledge came amid
‘ recent talks between the two on a
raft of State and Manly issues.

Dr Macdonald also walked away
from the meeting conﬁdent the
State Government would honor.a
promise to provide $8.5 million in
the May Budget for the Manly
Wharf bus/ferry interchange pm}-
ect.

“We reminded Bob Carr of his
promise for the interchange and I’m
anticipating the money Will be in
the Budget,” Dr Macdonald said.

On mercy killing, Dr Macdonald

(

 

by PAUL FRASER in
State Parliament

 

said allowing MPs to vote on their
conscience rather than along party
lines would give the planned legis-
lation a better chance of success.

“It means it’s not condemned to
defeat, Wthh it would be if Caucus
took a ‘No’ position,” he said.

It is believed Mr Carr will need
to get approval for the MPs’
conscience vote from rank-and-ﬁle
party members at the ALP’s next
State conference.

Dr Macdonald said the two met
at Mr Carr’s city headquarters for
almost one hour, where government
plans for nude bathing at Reef
Beach, the Manly Wharf inter-
change and constitutional reform

Were among“ several issues dis-
cussed.

Mr Carr’s ofﬁce called the
meeting, which was held in the
climate of fallout from Labor’s
disastrous Federal election loss and
several unpopular State Govem-
ment initiatives.

Dr Macdonald said it was the
ﬁrst private meeting outside parlia-
mentary sitting times the two had
held since the government came to
ofﬁce last March.

He said he believed Mr Carr,
now the only aﬂ-Labor premier
and whose Government holds
power by one seat, was shocked by
the Federal party’s heavy loss and
the fall of Queensland’s Labor
government.

However, during the meeting Mr
Carr stressed there was no prospect
of any looming by-elections that

06 Vote Pledge

had the potential to shift the balance
of power.

Dr Macdonald said Mr Carr’s
report card for the ﬁrst year in
Government had not been great and
many people had been alienated.

“I know people in Manly are not
particularly impressed by his ﬁrst
year.

“They see him as a distant and
autocratic ruler. That’s the context
our meeting took place in.”

Dr Macdonald said he repeated
his opposition to nude bathing at
Reef Beach as Environment Minis-
ter Pam Allan’s draft legislation
draws closer to Cabinet discussion.

Mr Carr’s ofﬁce conﬁrmed the
talks took place but would not
comment on reasons for calling the
meeting. ,. 7 ‘

been told.

However, this would only
happen if the emu industry
integrated its production, pro-
cessing and distribution bet-
ter, said a Westpac agribusi-
ness adviser, Mr Murray Hird.

The future of the industry
depended on a market
approach based on product
differentiation and con-
sumer identification.

“Demand for emu prod-
ucts can only increase if the
industry builds consumer
awareness. This requires not
only clever marketing cam-
paigns but also commitment,
communication and capi-
tal,” Mr Hird said.

He suggested this could be
achieved by the establish-
ment of marketing groups.

“Who knows, we may
soon see emu offered on

of approval by the National
Heart Foundation and in
farm fresh burgers at the
local take-away,” Mr Hird
said.

Janet homes in on an Asian empire

ANET LEE Holmes a
Court laughs as she
manoeuvres her chopsticks
towards a plastic plate of
cuttleﬁsh in a busy Kuala
Lumpur food market.

Her blonde hair makes the
widow of entrepreneur Robert
Holmes a Court stand out
among the hundreds of hungry
locals. But no-one recognises
the laughing woman in the
black Levis as Australia’s
wealthiest woman.

“At least you know you’re in
South—East Asia when you eat at
these sorts of places,” remarks
Mrs Holmes a Court, whose
extensive interests kept her out
of her Perth hometown for half
of last year.

“The food' is incidental in
some ways — it’s the experi-
ence,” she said.

It was a completely different
story six years ago when Janet
Holmes a Court’s Asian experi-
ences were conﬁned to a couple
of brief stopovers on return
flights to Perth.

But since her husband died of
a heart attack in 1990, her life
has turned upside down. She
now sits on the Reserve Bank
board and presides over one of
Australia’s biggest private com-
panies with assets of $650
million and about $250 million
in shareholder funds.

These days, Janet Holmes 2‘!

‘Asia’ because the cultural

Cultural diversity is something
that Asia hasin buckets com-

pared with Europe. .

“There is almost as much
difference between the Thai
culture and the Indonesian
culture as there is between the
Malaysian culture and the Aus-

tralian one.”

Well before it became “popu-
lar and trendy” Mrs Holmes a

Court shifted the focus of the‘

family company, Heytesbury
Holdings, from the West to the
East, said its chief executive Mr
Darrel Jarvis.

He added: “Who would have
believed ﬁve years ago you
could have Northern Territory
beef in the top supermarkets in
Singapore?”

By the turn of the century,
Heytesbury Holdings expects to
be dOing $1 billion of business In
South- East Asia or about half
its projected turnover.

About 60 per cent of that
revenue is expected to be derived
from the John Holland construc-
tion group, with Heytesbury’s
value-added live cattle and beef
exports contributing most of the
rest. Further earnings will come
from another two or more
theatres, and Heytesbury Pasto-

ral’s plans for its thoroughbred
horses.

While the corporate after-
math of the 19805 made con-
glomerates unfashionable in
Australia, Mr Jarvis says Hey-
tesbury’ 5 structure was no dis-
advantage in the Asian region.

“Family based conglomer-
ates are popular throughout
Asia, so they understand Hev-
tesbury,” he said. “A lot of

business is done here through-«I It; " '

family—related companies.”

ine, 26; Simon, 23; and Paul, 22
— get together with their mother
at 1z‘least twice a year for formal
Heytesbury shareholder meet-
ings but will not waltz into
senior jobs in the group.

Mrs Holmes in Court said:
“The philosophy that I’ve
always had, and what I’ve
always said to them, is that if
they wished to come into Hey-
tesbury, I would be absoluteIV
thrilled. If they don’t want to

The most salutary lesson
from John Holland’s experi-

venturing into Indonesia in

It is one such relationship

John Holland Asia is perhaps
best known in Australia as the
company that built the F riend-

and funded by the Australian

economic importance to Kota

According to John Holland
Asia’s chief executive, Mr

relevance of the Hume alliance
was that it opened up big-ticket
opportunities for the group to
design and construct projects

Heytesbury beef, sold under
the RM Heytesbury brand, is
also available in Singapore’s
best supermarkets under a
separate alliance with Singa-
pore’ 8 biggest food distributor,
the Tai Wee Company

Mr Jarvis said improved
efﬁciencies at the Johor Bahiu

feedlot increased the average
daily weight gains of the Heytes- .
bury cattle to 1. 1 kilos — which
was sufficient progress for the-
joint-venture partners to com?”
mit to building a more mode1 n.

feedlot at a cost of up to $2
million.

Heytesbury also plans to

build a $6.6 million beef pro-
cessing plant in Malaysia next
year.

This will be the ﬁrst in a

Mr Jarvis said there was
scope within these plans for
Heytesbury to create a regional
marketing and distribution net-
work in South-East Asia, which
also could be used to export
other food products.

Both Mr Jarvis and Mrs
Holmes :1 Court caution that
breaking into Asian markets is
littered'with pitfalls for those
who do not take the time to put
in place the necessary building
blocks. It is crucial to ﬁrst
establish customer bases and
business relationships before
Spending money on infrastruc-
ture. “There’s so much hype in
Australia about Asia, but we
[have not come up here with

jrose- -coloured glasses,” said Mr
Jarvis.

“People think there' is a pot of

gold here and that the local
competition is a pushover. But
don’t think you’re just compet-
ing locally because the rest of
the world has also honed in on
Asia’

Heytesbury’ s progress in
South-East Asia appears to
vindicate Mr Jarvis’s vision for
value-added beef exports, a
faith he says Robert_Holmes a
Court did not share.

Mr Jarvis, whom 'Mrs
Holmes a Court made group
'chief executive in 1991, oversaw
Heytesbury’ s vulnerable transi-
tion through what he terms “the
war years”.

The worst of the war years
was 1992, when Heytesbury
booked a $33.5 million loss as it
shed non-core assets to reduce
debts that had peaked around
$400 million.

,

Heytesbury weathered that
turbulent period to book proﬁts
of $4.4 million in 1993 and $7.3
million in 1994, with similar
earnings growth expected in the
1995 calendar year.

Despite the time spent now in
Asia, Mrs Holmes a Court has
plenty of time for her key
interests.

The need to devote more time
to the business has involved the
former schoolteacher in giving
up some educational appoint-
ments. However, Mrs Holmes a
Court remains strongly
involved in the arts.

As a member of the Reserve“

Bank board, Mrs Holmes a
Court dismissed digs by the
Leader of the Federal Opposi-

tion, Mr Howard, at the inde-
pendence of the Reserve Bank
Governor, Mr Fraser, but
admitted the board’s composi-
tion was likely to change if
Howard won on March 2.

“I think there’s probably no
doubt that with a new govern-
ment there would be conversa-
tions taking place, but what
changes they would make I
don’t really know,” she said.

“T here’s been a lot of talk~
and obviously some people in
the Opposition do think that
Bernie is a puppet of the
Government . . . but to say that

. is insulting, and also very
insulting for the rest of us on the
board.”

Deer Dodie:

Thanks for sending the beautiful celenoar. You always seem
to fins wonderful things.

I'm glaﬁ to report that no further action has been taken in
Congress against the Wile Bird Conservation not. All seems
to be quiet on that front, and we hope the enemies of this
valuable legislation remain quiet, especially in View of the
recent confession of Tony Silva ans his mother, Mrs. Daoud.
As you know, Silva made a name for himself as a orotector of
rare seecies of parrots while all the time engaging in
smuggling hyacinth macews ans other severely enéangereo
.species ans making huge sums of money in the process. He has‘
not yet been sentenced, out regaraless of how much he is
jaileo or fined, he is now a confesses felon. I hope the
effect of this news will also reach Australian poachers ans
smugglers ans discourage them from playing this ﬁangerous
game.

I trust you hears about the conviction of the cockatoo egg
smuggler July 5, less. Encloseﬁ is a resort on that case.

Are the poor toeles getting the yroteotion they sesyerately
neeﬁ?

All gooo wishes to you,

Christine Stevens
