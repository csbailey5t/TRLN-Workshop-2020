FIRST FEDERAL LAW TO PREVENT
CRUELTY TO ANIMALS
by The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
United States Department of Agriculture

I would be astonished to find Texas cattle in good condition upon
arrival at their places of destination. The manner in which they are
crowded on ship board and cars, after being exhausted by hurried
journeys over the immense prairies of Texas, necessarily develops any
latent germs of disease and may cause diseases in the healthiest cattle.
For instance, thousands are shipped to New Orleans from Indianola
and Lavacca, a journey from three to six days, during which they
receive neither food nor water. At New Orleans, they are transferred
to boats for Cairo, and thence to Tolono, Illinois. During the entire trip
they have food and water but about three times.

_ That’s how Dr. Manheimer of the Chicago Board of Health described con-
ditions in Texas, 101 years ago.

Between Indianola, Texas, and New Orleans, Louisiana, cattle were carried
on steamers, under deck, in a crowded condition, with poor ventilation—four
and five days and sometimes longer—without feed or water. In one instance
reported, of 150 cattle shipped, 40 died on the short voyage.

Other voices were heard in protest against cruelty to animals in transit. The
people of Boston were aroused by reports of inhumane treatment of cattle dur-
ing transport and by reports of diseased meats found in their markets. In April
1871, a joint special committee of the Aldermen and Common Council was
appointed to collect information and to ascertain what legislation was necessary
to protect the public health.

From the Chicago Live Stock Reporter, the committee learned that:

There is great cruelty in transportation. Cars are terribly over-
crowded, and animals are carried great distances without food or
water. The result is that they are taken out of the cars at Chicago with
bruises and sores, and legs and horns are broken; many of them dead
and more almost dead; and sometimes cattle and hogs, and sometimes
cattle and sheep, are packed in the same car which results in the
smaller animals being trampled upon by the larger. The men
employed to drive them into the cars (at Chicago) are armed with sap-
lings weighing often from eight to ten pounds, with sharp spikes or
goads at the end. They rush upon the cattle, yelling, swearing, and
punching them with these spikes often twenty, thirty, or forty times,
taking little care to avoid the eyes. Eighteen to twenty cattle are thus
forced into thirty-foot cars giving less than two foot space to the animal
and not infrequently smaller animals—calves, sheep and swine—are
crowded under them. In this way they are often carried for days with-
out food, water, or possibility of lying down.

 




Animals and Their Legal Rights

Almost certainly, this same neglectful and inhumane system of loading and
transportation of animals prevailed over the entire United States, based on simi-
lar reports received from many livestock shipping points.

It was chronicled in Chicago papers in 1870 as a remarkable fact that a ship-
ment of 194 cattle from Brigham Young’s farm in Utah to Chicago, ". . . in riding
1,500 miles, the loss of weight was only 210 pounds per head.”

Publication of scathing criticism of the cattle transportation methods
resulted in the introduction of a bill in Congress in 1871 to regulate cattle trans-
portation. The bill was ﬁnally passed on March 3, 1873, and became known as
the Twenty-Eight Hour Law.

The 1873 Act was a step forward in developing humane standards for the
. transportation of cattle, sheep, and swine. In order to comply with the Act,
transportation companies were obliged to provide facilities at convenient places
on their lines where feed, water, and rest could be furnished. Early pens and
enclosures provided for this purpose were extremely crude and were often
poorly furnished. Many of the loading and unloading chutes were poorly con-
structed and resulted in injury to the animals. Few of the pens provided for pro-
tection against rain or snow; some were not equipped with either feeding or
watering troughs. The pens were often so muddy that cattle would not lie down
even to rest. Too often, the feed was dumped in the mud and animals forced to
drink from contaminated mud holes.

The conditions under which livestock was handled in transit were slightly
improved under this law. Dissatisfaction arose among the shippers because of
the poor conditions and the frequent unloading of the animals. Numerous con-
victions for noncompliance with the Act were obtained, but the Act of 1873 was
repealed and the present Twenty-Eight Hour Law was enacted on June 29, 1906.

The Twenty-Eight Hour Law of 1906 was enacted, however, before motor
transportation had come into general use; so protective provisions of the Act do
not apply to‘ animals moved interstate in trucks. Several efforts have been made
to have the law amended to cover this modern development in livestock trans-
portation, but such amendments have not been made.

The 1906 Act was a stronger law than that of 1873, and its provisions were
enforced immediately. Waybills and records'maintained by carriers and others
were examined daily. Apparent violations were reported at stations where U. S.
Department of Agriculture livestock inspectors of the Bureau of Animal Indus-
try, now known as the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, were sta-
tioned. Inspections were made at feed, water, and rest stations throughout the
United States to ascertain whether the facilities and equipment were maintained
for the safe and humane handling of the species of animals which they were
designed to accommodate. Unsatisfactory conditions found at the stations were
promptly brought to the attention of the affected railroads for corrective action.

Effective enforcement of the law was evident even in early years. The 1908
Yearbook of the Department of Agriculture carried the following statement on
the enforcement of the Twenty-Eight Hour Law:

During the year a very large number of cases have been brought,
at the instigation of this Department, against various railway compan-

 




First Federal Law

ies for violations of the Twenty-Eight Hour Law, which limits the num-
ber of hours during which a shipment of livestock may be kept in cars
without unloading for feed, water, and rest. In 401 of these cases
penalties were imposed amounting in all to $61,530, and costs
assessed amounting to $7,201.70, and 828 cases were pending at the
close of the year.

Enforcement of the Act has continued throughout the years. However, with
the increased use of trucks as a means of conveyance, there has been a steady
decline in the movement of livestock by railroads. In contrast to the early years,
when most shipments were by rail and there were about 900 feed, water, and
rest stations operated by the railroad companies, the number of such stations
has dwindled to about 25, and many of these have not been used for several
years. Fewer than 100 violations of the Twenty-Eight Hour Law were reported
in 1976, as compared to nearly 400 cases reported as recently as 1967. No viola-
tions of the Twenty-Eight Hour Law were reported in 1988.

The Twenty-Eight Hour Law has become a way of life, and many fail to
appreciate the improvements that have been made in the humane handling of
livestock while in transit on our railroads. Constant vigilance is also a reminder
that the government is interested in seeing that the law is carried out.

The Twenty-Eight Hour Law was enacted in response to public demand for
the humane care and treatment of animals destined for slaughter. Results of this
law can be measured by the improved condition of livestock in transit and at
slaughtering plants; greater returns to the producer; and wholesome meat for
the consumer at reasonable prices.

The year 1984 was signiﬁcant in that it marked the 100th anniversary of the
first nationally organized efforts to control and stamp out dangerous animal dis-
eases and to ensure more humane care of animals.

On May 29, 1884, Congress created the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI)
within the U. S. Department of Agriculture. The purpose of the BAI was to pre-
vent the exportation of diseased livestock and to provide the means for the sup-
pression and eradication of contagious diseases among domestic animals. The
BAI was also charged with enforcing the Twenty-Eight Hour Law. The structure
and purpose of the BAI still carry on today, but it is now known as Veterinary
Services (VS) of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).

There have been significant spin-offs from the work of the Bureau and its
successors. In the late 1800’s, three BAI scientists proved that ticks spread Texas
fever in cattle. This discovery in the field of animal health led to the control of
yellow fever in humans and enabled U. S. workers to complete the Panama
Canal where two attempts by the French failed. In the 100 years since its incep—
tion, the BAI and its succeeding agencies have led the ﬁght which has resulted
in the eradication of twelve exotic or domestic diseases from the United States.

Veterinary Services’ responsibilities expanded beyond disease eradication
and control activities in 1966 when the Congress of the United States, respond-
ing to public pressure and indignation over inhumane treatment of animals,
passed the Animal Welfare Act. It was subsequently amended and expanded in
scope in 1970, 1976, and 1985. This legislation thus thrust the present day suc-
cessor of the old BAI into the arena of the humane care of animals and placed it
on a national level.

 




Animals and Their Legal Rights

In 1988, APHIS was reorganized. At that time, the Animal Care and Regu-
latory Enforcement staffs were removed from Veterinary Services and placed in
a section by themselves called Regulatory Enforcement and Animal Care
(REAC). REAC is charged with assuring the humane care of warm-blooded
animals used for commerce. Similarly, the Horse Protection Act, passed in 1970
and amended in 1976, which gives the Department regulatory authority to
prohibit the showing, exhibition, or selling of sored horses, was also assigned to
the Animal Care staff. (See Appendix for listing of REAC and Veterinary
Services offices.)

I would be astonished to find Texas cattle

food and water but about three times.

That's how Dr. Manheimer of the Chicago Board of Health
described conditions in Texas, 101 years ago.

Between Indianola, Texas, and New Orleans, Louisiana,
cattle were carried on steamers, under deck, in a crowded
condition, with poor ventilation-~four and five days and
sometimes longer-—without feed or water. In one instance
reported, of 150 cattle shipped, 40 died on the short voyage.

Other voices were heard in protest against cruelty to
animals in transit. The peOple of Boston were aroused by
reports of inhumane treatment of cattle during transport and
by reports of diseased meats found in their markets. In
April 1871, a joint Special committee of the Aldermen and
Common Council was appointed to collect information and to
ascertain what legislation was necessary to protect the

public health.

From the Chicago Live Stock Reporter, the committee

 




learned that:

There is great cruelty in transportation.
Cars are terribly overcrowded, and animals are
carried great distances without food or water.
The result is that they are taken out of the cars
at Chicago with bruises and sores, and legs and
horns are broken; many of them dead and more almost
dead; and sometimes cattle and hogs, and sometimes
cattle and sheep, are packed in the same car which
results in the smaller animals being trampled upon
by the larger. The men employed to drive them into
the cars (at Chicago) are armed with saplings weighing
often from eight to ten pounds, with sharp spikes or
goads at the end. They rush upon the cattle, yelling,
swearing, and punching them with these spikes often
twenty, thirty, or forty times, taking little care
to avoid the eyes. Eighteen to twenty cattle are
thus forced into thirty-foot cars giving less than
two foot space to the animal and not infrequently
smaller animals—-ca1ves, sheep and swine-—are crowded
under them. In this way they are often carried for
days without food, water, or possibility of lying
down.

Almost certainly, this same neglectful and inhumane
system of loading and transportation of animals prevailed
over the entire United States, based on similar reports
received from many livestock shipping points.

It was chronicled in Chicago papers in 1870 as a

remarkable fact that a shipment of 194 cattle from Brigham

Young's farm in Utah to Chicago, ". . . in riding 1,500

miles, the loss of weight was only 210 pounds per head."
Publication of scathing criticism of the cattle
transportation methods resulted in the introduction of a bill
in Congress in 1871 to regulate cattle transportation. The
bill was finally passed on March 3, 1873, and became known as
the Twenty—Eight Hour Law.
The 1873 Act was a step forward in developing humane

standards for the transportation of cattle, sheep, and swine.

 




In order to comply with the Act, transportation companies
were obliged to provide facilities at convenient places on
their lines where feed, water, and rest could be furnished.
Early pens and enclosures provided for this purpose were
extremely crude and were often poorly furnished. Many of the
loading and unloading chutes were poorly constructed and
resulted in injury to the animals. Few of the pens provided
for protection against rain or snow; some were not equipped
with either feeding or watering troughs. The pens were often
so muddy that cattle would not lie down even to rest. Too
often, the feed was dumped in the mud and animals forced to
drink from contaminated mud holes.

The conditions under which livestock was handled in
transit were slightly improved under this law.
Dissatisfaction arose among the shippers because of the poor
conditions and the frequent unloading of the animals.
Numerous convictions for noncompliance with the Act were
obtained, but the Act of 1873 was repealed and the present
Twenty—Eight Hour Law was enacted on June 29, 1906.

The Twenty-Eight Hour Law of 1906 was enacted, however,
before motor transportation had come into general use; so
protective provisions of the Act do not apply to animals
moved interstate in trucks. Several efforts have been made
to have the law amended to cover this modern develOpment in
livestock transportation, but such amendments have not been

made.

The 1906 Act was a stronger law than that of 1873, and

 




6/

its provisions were enforced immediately. waybills and
records maintained by carriers and others were examined
daily. Apparent violations were reported at stations where
U. S. Department of Agriculture livestock inspectors of the
Bureau of Animal Industry, now known as the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service, were stationed. Inspections were
made at feed, water, and rest stations throughout the United
States to ascertain whether the facilities and equipment were
maintained for the safe and humane handling of the Species of
animals which they were designed to accommodate.
Unsatisfactory conditions found at the stations were promptly
brought to the attention of the affected railroads for
corrective action.

Effective enforcement of the law was evident even in
early years. The 1908 Yearbook of the Department of
Agriculture carried the following statement on the
enforcement of the Twenty—Eight Hour Law:

During the year a very large number of cases

have been brought, at the instigation of this

Department, against various railway companies for

violations of the Twenty-Eight Hour Law, which

limits the number of hours during which a shipment

of livestock may be kept in cars without unloading

for feed, water, and rest. In 401 of these cases

penalties were imposed amounting in all to $61,530,

and costs assessed amounting to $7,201.70, and 828

cases were pending at the close of the year.

Enforcement of the Act has continued throughout the
years. However, with the increased use of trucks as a means
of conveyance, there has been a steady decline in the

movement of livestock by railroads. In contrast to the early

years, when most shipments were by rail and there were about

 




5’

900 feed, water, and rest stations Operated by the railroad
companies, the number of such stations has dwindled to about
25, and many of these have not been used for several years.
Fewer than 100 violations of the Twenty-Eight Hour Law were
reported in 1976, as compared to nearly 400 cases reported as
recently as 1967. No violations of the Twenty—Eight Hour Law
were reported in 1988.

The Twenty-Eight Hour Law has become a way of life, and
many fail to appreciate the improvements that have been made
in the humane handling of livestock while in transit on our
railroads. Constant vigilance is also a reminder that the
government is interested in seeing that the law is carried
out.

The Twenty-Eight Hour Law was enacted in response to
public demand for the humane care and treatment of animals
destined for slaughter. Results of this law can be measured
by the improved condition of livestock in transit and at
slaughtering plants; greater returns to the producer; and
wholesome meat for the consumer at reasonable prices.

The year 1984 was significant in that it marked the
100th anniversary of the first nationally organized efforts
to control and stamp out dangerous animal diseases and to
ensure more humane care of animals.

On May 29, 1884, Congress created the Bureau of Animal

Industry (BAI) within the U. S. Department of Agriculture.

The purpose of the BAI was to prevent the exportation of

diseased livestock and to provide the means for the

 




é

suppression and eradication of contagious diseases among
domestic animals. The BAI was also charged with enforcing
the Twenty-Eight Hour Law. The structure and purpose of the
BAI still carry on today, but it is now known as Veterinary
Services (VS) of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS).

There have been significant spin-offs from the work of
the Bureau and its successors. In the late 1800's, three BAI
scientists proved that ticks Spread Texas fever in cattle.
This discovery in the field of animal health led to the

control of yellow fever in humans and enabled U. S. workers

to complete the Panama Canal where two attempts by the French

failed. In the 100 years since its inception, the BAI and
its succeeding agencies have led the fight which has resulted
in the eradication of twelve exotic or domestic diseases from
the United States.

Veterinary Services' responsibilities expanded beyond
disease eradication and control activities in 1966 when the
Congress of the United States, responding to public
pressure and indignation over inhumane treatment of animals,
passed the Animal Welfare Act. It was subsequently amended
and expanded in sc0pe in 1970, 1976, and 1985. This
legislation thus thrust the present day successor of the old
BAI into the arena of the humane care of animals and placed
it on a national level.

In 1988, APHIS was reogranized. At that time, the

Animal Care and Regulatory Enforcement staffs were removed

 




7/

from Veterinary Services and placed in a section by
themselves called Regulatory Enforcement and Animal Care
(REAC). REAC is charged with assuring the humane care of
warm-blooded animals used for commerce. Similarly, the Horse
Protection Act, passed in 1970 and amended in 1976, which
gives the Department regulatory authority to prohibit the
showing, exhibition, or selling of sored horses, was also
assigned to the Animal Care staff. (See Appendix for listing

of REAC and Veterinary Services offices.)

CHAPTER II

FIRST FEDERAL LAW TO PREVENT CRUELTY TO ANIMALS

by The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
United States Department of Agriculture

'1 would be astonished to find Texas cattle

in good condition upon arrival at their places

of destination. The manner in which they are

crowded on ship board and cars, after being

exhausted by hurried journeys over the immense

prairies of Texas, necessarily develops any

latent germs of disease and may cause diseases

in the healthiest cattle. For instance, thousands

are shipped to New Orleans from Indianola and Lavacca,

a journey from three to six days, during which they

receive neither food nor water. At New Orleans, they

are transferred to boats for Cairo, and thence to

Tolono, Illinois. During the entire trip they have

food and water but about three times.

That's how Dr. Manheimer of the Chicago Board of Health
described conditions in Texas, 101 years ago.

Between Indianola, Texas, and New Orleans, Louisiana,
cattle were carried on steamers, under deck, in a crowded
condition, with poor ventilation—~four and five days and
sometimes longer—-without feed or water. In one instance
reported, of 150 cattle shipped, 40 died on the short voyage.

Other voices were heard in protest against cruelty to
animals in transit. The people of Boston were aroused by
reports of inhumane treatment of cattle during transport and
by reports of diseased meats found in their markets. In
April 1871, a joint special committee of the Aldermen and
Common Council was appointed to collect information and to

ascertain what legislation was necessary to protect the

public health.

 




_2-

From the Chicago Live Stock Reporter, the committee

learned that:

There is great cruelty in transportation.
Cars are terribly overcrowded, and animals are
carried great distances without food or water.
The result is that they are taken out of the cars
at Chicago with bruises and sores, and legs and
horns are broken; many of them dead and more almost
dead; and sometimes cattle and hogs, and sometimes
cattle and sheep, are packed in the same car which
results in the smaller animals being trampled upon
by the larger. The men employed to drive them into
the cars (at Chicago) are armed with saplings weighing
often from eight to ten pounds, with sharp spikes or
goads at the end. They rush upon the cattle, yelling,
swearing, and punching them with these spikes often
twenty, thirty, or forty times, taking little care
to avoid the eyes. Eighteen to twenty cattle are
thus forced into thirty-foot cars giving less than
two foot Space to the animal and not infrequently
smaller animals--calves, sheep and swine—~are crowded
under them. In this way they are often carried for
days without food, water, or possibility of lying
down.

Almost certainly, this same neglectful and inhumane
system of loading and transportation of animals prevailed
over the entire United States, based on similar reports
received from many livestock shipping points.

It was chronicled in Chicago papers in 1870 as a

Publication of scathing criticism of the cattle
transportation methods resulted in the introduction of a bill
in Congress in 1871 to regulate cattle transportation. The

bill was finally passed on March 3, 1873, and became known as

 




the Twenty-Eight Hour Law.

The 1873 Act was a step forward in developing humane

FIRST FEDERAL LAW TO PREVENT CRUELTY TO ANIMALS

CHAPTER II

by The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
United States Department of Agriculture

I would be astonished to find Texas cattle
in good condition upon arrival at their places
of destination. The manner in which they are
crowded on ship board and cars, after being
exhausted by hurried journeys over the immense
prairies of Texas, necessarily deve10ps any
latent germs of disease and may cause diseases
in the healthiest cattle. For instance, thousands
are shipped to New Orleans from Indianola and Lavacca,
a journey from three to six days, during which they
receive neither food nor water. At New Orleans, they
are transferred to boats for Cairo, and thence to
Tolono, Illinois. During the entire trip they have
food and water but about three times.

That's how Dr. Manheimer of the Chicago Board of Health
described conditions in Texas, 101 years ago.

Between Indianola, Texas, and New Orleans, Louisiana,
cattle were carried on steamers, under deck, in a crowded
condition, with poor ventilation-—four and five days and
sometimes longer--without feed or water. In one instance
reported, of 150 cattle shipped, 40 died on the short voyage.

Other voices were heard in protest against cruelty to

animals in transit. The peOple of Boston were aroused by

reports of inhumane treatment of cattle during transport and

by reports of diseased meats found in their markets. In
April 1871, a joint special committee of the Aldermen and
Common Council was appointed to collect information and to

ascertain what legislation was necessary to protect the

public health.

 




_2_

From the Chicago Lisle Stock W, the committee
learned that:

There is great cruelty in transportation.
Cars are terribly overcrowded, and animals are
carried great distances without food or water.
The result is that they are taken out of the cars
at Chicago with bruises and sores, and legs and
horns are broken; many of them dead and more almost
dead; and sometimes cattle and hogs, and sometimes
cattle and sheep, are packed in the same car which
results in the smaller animals being trampled upon
by the larger. The men employed to drive them into
the cars (at Chicago) are armed with saplings weighing
often from eight to ten pounds, with sharp spikes or
goads at the end. They rush upon the cattle, yelling,
swearing, and punching them with these spikes often
twenty, thirty, or forty times, taking little care
to avoid the eyes. Eighteen to twenty cattle are
thus forced into thirty-foot cars giving less than
two foot space to the animal and not infrequently
smaller animals-—calves, sheep and swine—~are crowded
under them. In this way they are often carried for
days without food, water, or possibility of lying
down.

Almost certainly, this same neglectful and inhumane
system of loading and transportation of animals prevailed
over the entire United States, based on similar reports
received from many livestock shipping points.

It was chronicled in Chicago papers in 1870 as a
remarkable fact that a shipment of 194 cattle from Brigham
Young's farm in Utah to Chicago, ". . . in riding 1,500
miles, the loss of weight was only 210 pounds per head."

Publication of scathing criticism of the cattle
transportation methods resulted in the introduction of a bill

in Congress in 1871 to regulate cattle transportation. The

bill was finally passed on March 3, 1873, and became known as

 




the Twenty-Eight Hour Law.

The 1873 Act was a step forward in developing humane
standards for the transportation of cattle, sheep, and swine.
In order to comply with the Act, transportation companies
were obliged to provide facilities at convenient places on
their lines where feed, water, and rest could be furnished.
Early pens and enclosures provided for this purpose were

extremely crude and were often poorly furnished. Many of the

loading and unloading chutes were poorly constructed and

resulted in injury to the animals. Few of the pens provided
for protection against rain or snow; some were not equipped
with either feeding or watering troughs. The pens were often
so muddy that cattle would not lie down even to rest. Too
often, the feed was dumped in the mud and animals forced to
drink from contaminated mud holes.

The conditions under which livestock was handled in
transit were slightly improved under this law.
Dissatisfaction arose among the shippers because of the poor
conditions and the frequent unloading of the animals.

.
Numerous convictions for noncompliance with the Act were
obtained, but the Act of 1873 was repealed and the present
Twenty—Eight Hour Law was enacted on June 29, 1906.

The Twenty—Eight Hour Law of 1906 was enacted, however,

before motor transportation had come into general use;ll'

 




-4-

to have the law amended to cover this modern development in
livestock transportation, but such amendments have not been
made.

The 1906 Act was a stronger law than that of 1873, and
its provisions were enforced immediately. Waybills and
records maintained by carriers and others were examined

daily. Apparent violations were reported at stations where

U. S. Department of Agriculture livestock inspectors of the ::jl)(

Bureau of Animal Industry, now known as the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service, were stationed. Inspections were
made at feed, water, and rest stations throughout the United
States to ascertain whether the facilities and equipment were
maintained for the safe and humane handling of the species of
animals which they were designed to accommodate. )(f
Unsatisfactory conditions found at the stations were promptly
brought to the attention of the affected railroads for
corrective action.

Effective enforcement of the law was evident even in
early years. The 1908 Yearbook of the Department of
Agriculture carried the following statement on the
enforcement of the Twenty-Eight Hour Law:

During the year a very large number of cases

have been brought, at the instigation of this

Department, against various railway companies for

violations of the Twenty—Eight Hour Law, which

limits the number of hours during which a shipment

of livestock may be kept in cars without unloading

for feed, water, and rest. In 401 of these cases

penalties were imposed amounting in all to $61, 530,
and costs assessed amounting to $7,201.70, and 828

 




_5...

cases were pending at the Close of the year.

Enforcement of the Act has continued throughout the
years. However, with the increased use of trucks as a means
of conveyance, there has been a steady decline in the
movement of livestock by railroads. In contrast to the early
years, when most shipments were by rail and there were about
900 feed, water, and rest stations Operated by the railroad
companies,ﬁgge_numbg@mqfusughvstatignsrhasgaWindsgﬁggjhggﬁ-,

The Twenty-Eight Hour Law has become a way of life, and
many fail to appreciate the improvements that have been made
in the humane handling of livestock while in transit on our
railroads. Constant vigilance is also a reminder that the
government is interested in seeing that the law is carried
out.

The Twenty-Eight Hour Law was enacted in response to
public demand for the humane care and treatment of animals
destined for slaughter. Results of this law can be measured
by the improved condition of livestock in transit and at
slaughtering plants; greater returns to the producer; and
wholesome meat for the consumer at reasonable prices.

The year 1984 was significant in that it marked the

100th anniversary of the first nationally organized efforts

There have been significant spin-offs from the work of
the Bureau and its successors. In the late 1800is, three BAI
