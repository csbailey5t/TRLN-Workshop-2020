hardly admits of degrees. Although slavery is always wrong there is
such a thing as benevolent slave—holding. We can imagine that some
people's lives go better enslaved than if they were free. Of course
this is more of a problem for utilitarians than for us. We can condemn
it anyhow. Can they? Mill even thought he had to argue against
slavery, you recall, when he gave reasons why a person should never sell
himself into slavery. I think Bentham would have disagreed.

You might want to add the Gandhi remark about the greatness of a nation

may be judged by the way it treats its animals. Further proof that you
interpret him correctly.

Re things here: JoEllen won an award for being the university's
outstanding teacher. A rather obvious choice, I think. A nifty $3500
went with it. My billiards playing is so awful I want to throw
the table away but J likes its looks. So what can I do? I have an
irritated nerve in my neck which is affecting my lifting. I'd give the
lives of two vivisectors for instant relief. Next week I go home - a

reunion with a batch of Brooklyn College tracksters. God, how I'd love
to lose 40 pounds before I see those guys.

Tell me more about early, early retirement.

Gandhi was not a foolish man. Far from it. But even people of wisdom
sometimes believe foolish things. "Isn't this a case in point?," I asked myself.

crime than slavery or the human experiments conducted by Nazi doctors?"

I think I know how Gandhi would answer. First, he" would explain that
moral crimes belong in the "Worst Moral Crimes Humans Commit" column
when committing them is perfectly legal. That's part of what slavery, ethnic
cleansing, and vivisection have in common. Where they are practiced, there
are no laws prohibiting them.

Still, there are important differences between these great evils. In the
case of slavery, for example, while it was legal in most of the United States
throughout most of the nation's history, being a slave owner was not a
profession people prepared for by attending colleges or universities; not
something for which those who "showed real promise" were rewarded by
receiving scholarships or fellowships; not something for which those who

were "especially good" received prestigious awards or prizes.

Just the opposite is true of vivisection. Vivisection is a profession that

requires an advanced education. Vivisection is something for which those
who "show real promise" are rewarded by receiving scholarships and
fellowships. And vivisectors do compete for, and some of them win,
prestigious prizes and awards.

How, then, can there be a worse moral crime than vivisection,
enmeshed as the practice is in social institutions that not only permit, they
train people to commit evil, then reward them for doing it?

I think this gets close to what Gandhi believes. I also think we can get
closer by considering the suggestion that vivisectors are just like the Nazi

Dear Tom,

Thanks again for asking for my thoughts on your Gandhi

piece. I enjoyed reading it. And I look forward to seeing

it published. You are very right that Gandhi is often murky
and imprecise. What a task you have! Why would he think

that vivisection is the BLACKEST of all the black crimes?
Terrible? Certainly. One of the worst? No doubt. But the
very worst of all? That is a strong claim, with——as you point

out——an unfortunately large number of contenders vying for
the title.

I think that your read is a good one. It is wise to point out
that vivisection is a profession for which one trains and

for which one can be rewarded. It is also perfectly legal,
which only worsens the moral crime. But allow me to

play devil's advocate and suggest a critical response as

well as an alternative theory as to why Gandhi would call

it the worst of the worst.

As far as the response goes--two points. First, is it not the
case that slave dealers trained? Although there were not
professional schools and higher degrees, very few folks had
training such as this in the past. One apprenticed and studied
with others on the job. Surely those in the slave trade took on
workers and trained them. Just as a blacksmith or a cobbler
might. And there were rewards for doing well. Not fellowships,
but monetary rewards and respect/honor amongst one's peers.

The system of training and reward has changed, but it has been
there in one form or the other even since slave times.

Second, consider the claim that Nazi doctors and vivisectionists
both do evil, but the former chose evil after being trained for
good while the latter have been trained for evil all along. It
might be argued that Nazi doctors considered themselves to

be doing good. In their twisted worldview, Jews (and others)
did not count as people. Consequently, the doctors were
performing experiments on creatures outside the moral

boundary in order to do good for their fellows (i.e., for

if so, of course he might have revised his statement once they become
known.>

Though he did have some extremely odd views, eg about sexuality!

But even people of wisdom

sometimes believe foolish things. "Isn't this a case in point?," I asked
myself. "How could any sane, sensible person think that vivisection is a

I think I know how Gandhi would answer. First, he would explain that moral

committing them *is perfectly legal*. That's part of what slavery, ethnic

How, then, can there be a worse moral crime than vivisection, enmeshed as
the practice is in social institutions that not only permit, they *train*
people to commit evil, then *reward* them for doing it?

It might be helpful here to distinguish the evil of the institution

>from the moral blameworthiness of those who do it. Your argument

seems to be that the social acceptance of the practice makes it

worse; manybe but in my view it does make the people who do it less

morally blameworthy.>

I think this gets close to what Gandhi believes. I also think we can get
closer if by considering the suggestion that vivisectors are just like the
Nazi doctors: both trained professionals, both performing morally evil acts
that are perfectly legal. If this is true, vivisection certainly is a very

bad moral crime. Isn't that enough? Why go as far as Gandhi and judge it to
be the worst of the worst?

Though initially plausible, equating vivisectors and Nazi experimentors
overlooks an important difference. Those Nazi doctors who performed
experiments on unconsenting, defenseless human beings committed evil no
doubt. But unlike what is true of vivisectors, *these doctors, after being
trained to do good, chose to do evil*. Not so in the case of vivisectors.
In their case, *vivisectors choose to do evil after having been
professionally trained to do it*.

See my comment above on this.>

moral crime than that? It's possible that not all

anti-vivisectionists will agree in the answer they give. What's certain is
what Gandhi means and why he believed what he did. Right about so much, is
the Mahatma (the great-souled one) right about this, too? Now, *there's* a

question to ponder——the sort of food for thought even Gandhi would approve

Hi, Tina. Hope you're doing well. Things are *very* hectic at this end!

I'm more than a little confused. I received three copies of a letter from Gary Francione, addressed to

me, dated March 26. The letter contained a response to my essay on Gandhi. That letter was a shocker:
it misrepresented my ideas very badly.

Yesterday I received two copies of a new letter from Gary, this time with a cover letter addressed

both to me and to you, in which (what are said to be) "several typographical errors" that appeared in
the earlier letter are corrected.

It's not clear to me what this second/revised letter is supposed to be. I assume that it, like the
first one, is in the nature of a letter to me, since both begin "Dear Tom." If it is meant to be
anything more than this [as in "something—you—intend—to—publish—as—a—response—to—my-essay"], would you
be so kind as to let me know. It doesn't appear to be that since, as I say, both versions of the

letter begin, "Dear Tom." That's certainly the way I read it: as a personal letter. Still, I wanted to
be sure.

Thanks in advance for your time and trouble —

Tom

Hectic is not the word for it, on this end. But there's light at the end

of the tunnel (for a while, anyway...) —- though term here ends a few
weeks after State's.

Comments: a few, I'm not sure how helpful.

I have some dislike for the term "vivisection" itself. Few people know
quite what is meant —— at least, I find this is true when it comes up in
my classes. It has more historical relevance, and is somewhat loaded too.

But these reservations may not carry much weight in a magazine with the
term in its very title. OK.

Is it worse to do evil when you've trained for it or when you've not? I
think maybe the latter ~— when you are trained to heal and cure, as with
the Nazi doctors, then you truly pervert not only common decency but

your training as well. At least the other answer is debatable. Or perhaps
if it's worse to do evil when you're trained for it then it's the TRAINERS
who are the most deeply evil

ones. So at least I'm not fully persuaded by that part of the argument.

Maybe it's best to be a little less definite about Gandhi's own view, if
you're not certain of it yourself. (I wonder myself whether it isn't the
sheer innocence and inability to comprehend the pain and death on the
part of animals that makes our treatment of them so evil according to
Gandhi —— or the sustained character of the infliction of pain ~— not
just a single act but a whole deliberate planned institution...) Anyway,
you could present your essay as an interpretation rather than quite so
much "This is what G. means". But again, I am not sure of the readership
here, and maybe these academic nicities are out of place.

Thanks for showing me this piece. Done any fiction lately?

Hi, Sid. Long time no hear from. You still breathing? Hope so. My world

life is more settled. I'm thinking of taking early early—retirement!

I wonder if you could lend me a few minutes of your time and give me some
feedback on the following, which I wrote in response to "please do
something" from the editor of the American Anti—Vivisection Society's
magazine. Gandhi's meaning is murky, that's for sure. Knowing him as the

imprecise thinker that he is, maybe I get him all wrong. Anyhow, thanks in

"THE BLACKEST OF ALL THE BLACK CRIMES"

Tom Regan

The great Indian pacifist and political leader, Mahatma Gandhi, had a
profound influence on my life and on the lives of many other peace loving
people.

Through his writings Gandhi was the first person to challenge me to justify
eating meat. His ghost was the first person to whom I had to admit, through
my writings, that I could not meet the challenge. Anyone guided by the
Gandhian principle of *ahimsa*--anyone who aspires to live a life that
"does the least harm"—-in time must put an end to consuming corpses.

In addition to his vegetarian teachings, Gandhi was a staunch
anti—vivisectionist, once referring to vivisection as "the blackest of all
the black crimes." When I first read these words, I didn't give them much
thought. It was only some years later that I stopped to ask what Gandhi

might mean by this graphic statement and how he could possibly believe what
he said he did.

As for what he means, the words leave little room for doubt. Consider the
most evil things in the world. Slavery. Ethnic cleansing. The human
experiments conducted by Nazi doctors. All these (and much more, alas)
belong in the column headed "Worst Mbral Crimes Humans Commit." But the
worst of the worst, according to Gandhi, is not any of those I have listed.
The worst of all the worst crimes is . . . vivisection. I don't think there
is any question but that, when he describes vivisection as "the blackest of
all the black crimes," this is what Gandhi means.

Gandhi was not a foolish.man. Far from it. But even people of wisdom
sometimes believe foolish things. "Isn't this a case in point?," I asked
myself. "How could any sane, sensible person think that vivisection is a
worse moral crime than slavery or the human experiments conducted by Nazi
doctors?"

I think I know how Gandhi would answer. First, he would explain that moral
crimes belong in the "Worst Mbral Crimes Humans Commit" column when

care for the human body, doctors thus practice vivisection.

They will take this knowledge——gained through evil means-—and
attempt to do one thing with it: perpetuate and practice medical
science (the evil end). Thus, vivisection is the worst. Worse
than raising animals to eat; worse than investigating organic
chemistry in hopes of developing new medical drugs.

Once calling Western medicine "the concentrated essence of

black magic," it is not hard to imagine that Gandhi would think
vivisection to be doubly flawed——both in terms of the evil it

does to the animal and in terns of the evil goal it serves (i.e., to
further medical science). Nazi doctors experimented on and did

evil things to human beings, but not with the express goal of
bettering the science of medicine in general, and not within

the overall institutionalized system of Western medicine (which
nearly all of us accept and hope to benefit from).

I do not much agree with this reasoning myself, and I certainly

do not accept the foundational view of animals (as lower creatures)
on which it is based. I would see vivisection as morally
reprehensible for a completely different set of reasons. But this
is about the best I can do to offer any alternative thoughts on
what Gandhi is up to. Like you, I was influenced by his

thought years ago. As a Peace Studies major at Manchester
College, I was forced to think about the ethics of eating meat
when I started learning about Gandhi and Eastern Philosophy.
Later, my academic career took another direction, so

all I can offer here is my recollections on Gandhi and some
thoughts pieced together from the couple of books I still

have around.me now.

Again, these thoughts are offered with my thanks for your taking
time to ask me what Gandhi may be up to. You certainly raise
interesting issues and will cause the folks at the American Anti—
Vivisection Society to think hard (the food for thought line at
the end of your piece is a great ending, by the way!).

With all best wishes, I remain

Yours sincerely,

It is an excellent paper. Who would expect less from.you? Certainly,
I wouldn't. But a few details: I am surprised to see ethnic
cleansing listed as one of the legal monstrosities. I am of the
impression that it usually occurs in the course of war between ethnic
groups, as among African tribes in Somalia, etc. or in Bosnia. Among
the Nazis? I don't know if that stuff was legal. Consider the

Hi Tom,

I just had a near—finished letter to you deleted and I'm not sure if
it went out. Oh well, time to re-type it completely:

I went over your Gandhi article and liked what you had to say. Two
suggestions:

Make all sentences active instead of passive. For example, the first
sentence could read:

"The great Indian pacifist and political leader, Mahatma Gandhi,
profoudly influenced my life and the lives of many other peace—loving
people."

Second, you may wish to include the following, rewritten as necessary.
Feel free to use any of the words without changing them:

"Vivisection is the blackest crime because it demands not one, but two
immoral choices. The first choice is to receive years of training in
how to experiment on live animals. The second choice comes after all
this training, when the vivisectors make the choice each morning to
come into work. For each day, the vivisectors must choose to cage,
poison, prod, and cut open the animals they possess. A person needs
years of training and then a daily choice to do vivisection-it is
never done in the heat of the moment nor can it ever happen without
years of conscious preparation."

Hope this helps,
Erik

Aryan people). The same could be said for vivisectionists.
They most likely believe they are doing good for their
fellows by sacrificing morally unimportant creatures.

The point, I guess, would be that Nazis thought they were
good. They did not think they were choosing evil. Of
course, this does not excuse them; it only makes the

moral crime deeper, in a certain sense, for we are all
responsible for what we take to be good and bad as well.

I imagine that this is what Aristotle means when he claims
we act in character but are responsible for our character; or
how a continental philosopher would claim that we cannot
help but see the world through a cultural horizon and yet we
are responsible for accepting this horizon?

As for a possible alternative reading, I humbly offer the
following two possibilities.

(1) In volume 27 of Gandhi's COLLECTED WORKS, he explains

in an essay entitled "My Duty" that we have a special duty to
animals because they can do nothing to fight back if they are
abused. (This is related to Gandhi's insistence that animals are
lower creatures, lacking such abilities as language and self—
consciousness.) Unable to express their desires to us, we have
a duty to make sure that we never treat them in such a way that
if they could express a dislike, they would. Here is the quote
>from Gandhi:

"Man can explain his suffering, and can even try to free himself
>from it. Animals cannot do this. [TIherefore,...we have a
twofold duty towards them..."

So, I take it that performing a torturous experiment on a human
being is bad but not as bad, because the human can express his or
her dislike, understand (explain?) his or her suffering, and even
fight back. But an animal cannot do this; hence there is the crime
of inflicting the pain coupled with the crime of doing it to an
innocent creature who lacks the ability to understand, express its
desire, and fight back. Vivisection would be the worst.

(2) Perhaps Gandhi dislikes Vivisection so intensely because it
not only violates his desire for non—violence and peace, but
because it serves ends which he also sees as evil. (The means
and the ends would thus be the worst.) The end in question would
be the perpetuation of medical science.

Gandhi is, of course, murky and inconsistent. But there is some
regularity to his hatred for Western medicine. He says;many times
that he thought of becoming a doctor when he was young, until

he found out that he would have to practice Vivisection as a matter
of fact. (Why he even considered becoming a doctor is part of that
murkiness, given his general hatred of medicine, though.)

The problem seems to be that doctors fight death rather than let us
calmly slip away. Also, medicine does not let us learn from our
mistakes. (In a weird passage of volume 2 of THE MORAL AND
POLITICAL WRITINGS OF MAHATMA GANDHI, he argues

that a doctor prescribes antacid and we do not learn-—from the
pain--that we should not over-eat again; a doctor prescribes

other medicine (penicillin?) and we do not learn to refrain from
our carnal vices.) As a consequence, Gandhi suggests that
hospitals are institutions for propagating sin. Out of a mistaken

"THE BLACKEST OF ALL THE BLACK CRIMES"

Tom Regan

The great Indian pacifist and political leader, Mahatma Gandhi, had a
profound influence on my life and on the lives of many other peace loving
people.

Through his writings Gandhi was the first person to challenge me to
justify eating meat. His ghost was the first person to whom I had to admit,
through my writings, that I could not meet the challenge. Anyone guided by
the Gandhian principle of ahimsa--anyone who aspires to live a life that
"does the least harm"-—in time must put an end to consuming corpses.

In addition to his vegetarian teachings, Gandhi was a staunch anti-
vivisectionist, once referring to Vivisection as "the blackest of all the black
crimes." When I first read these words, I didn't give them much thought. It
was only some years later that I stopped to ask what Gandhi might mean by
this graphic statement and how he could possibly believe what he said he did.

As for what he means, the words leave little room for doubt. Consider
the most evil things in the world. Slavery. Ethnic cleansing. The human
experiments conducted by Nazi doctors. All these (and much more, alas)
belong in the column headed "Worst Moral Crimes Humans Commit." But

the worst of the worst, according to Gandhi, is not any of those I have listed.

The worst of all the worst crimes is . . . Vivisection. I don't think there is any

question but that, when he describes Vivisection as "the blackest of all the

black crimes," this is what Gandhi means.

 




perfectly legal. If this is true, vivisection certainly is a very bad moral crime.
Isn't that enough? Why go as far as Gandhi and judge it to be the worst of the
worst?

Though initially plausible, equating Vivisectors and Nazi
experimentors overlooks an important difference. Those Nazi doctors who
performed experiments on unconsenting, defenseless human beings
committed evil no doubt. But unlike what is true of Vivisectors, these
doctors, after being trained to do good, Chose to do evil. Not so in the case of
Vivisectors. In their case, vivisectors choose to do evil after having been
professionally trained to do it.

Is there a worst moral crime than that? It's possible that not all anti-
vivisectionists will agree in the answer they give. What's certain is what

Gandhi meant and why he believed what he did. Right about so much, is the

Mahatma (the great-souled one) right about this, too? Now, there’s a question

to ponder--the sort of food for thought even Gandhi would approve of.
