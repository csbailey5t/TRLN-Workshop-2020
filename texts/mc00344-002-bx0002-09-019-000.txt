Dear Mrs. Warner:

Thank you very much for your recent correspondence concerning
endangered species legislation.

I greatly appreciate your consideration in sharing with me
your interest in the plight of our nation's endangered species.
It may interest you to know that I am a cosponsor of S. 78, a
bill to amend the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 by providing
criminal penalties for shooting at certain birds, fish, and

other animals from aircraft. I am also a cosponsor of S. 1315
and S. 2579, similar bills to protect ocean mammals from.being
pursued, harassed, or killed.

Please be assured that I shall give your views serious consideration
as I continue to support endangered species legislation.

Sincerely,

.

Hon. Daniel K. Inouye

Washington, D.C .

Dear Senator Inouye,

We respectfully submit to you the enclosed
notes on the two Marine mammal Protection Acts as
passed by the Senate and House: S. 2871 and H.R.
thZO, hoping that they may prove useful to you in
conference.

Year help in bringing about adoption of the
strongest and most effective final bill will be
deeply appreciated by thousands of humanitarians,
and.we believe that the degree of importance of
this legislation will become increasingly apparent
in the coming years as the abilities of the differ»
ent species of ocean mammals becomes known. Only
now that the humpback'whale is threatened with.ex~
tinction have we learned of its songs, as mmch.as
hS minutes in length and with fantastic variations.
Only recently have we learned that one of the dolphin
species has a higher proportion of neocortex than
man himself! The strongest possible legislation is
called for to protect these still mysterious creatures
from whom we have much to learn.

We look to you to do everything possible in your
power to help them.

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens
Secretary

Dear Ms . Danfo rth:

This is to acknowledge receipt of your recent letter advising me of
your support for legislation to protect ocean marmnals and for the
budget request to carry out the animal welfare program authorized
by PL 91-579.

As you are probably aware, the Subcommittee on Oceans and Atmos-
phere of the Senate Commerce Committee has conducted hearings on
several measures designed to protect ocean mammals and additional
hearings are expected. As a member of this Subcommittee, I have
followed these hearings with great interest and shall continue to give
this matter my careful study.

I am a cosponsor of the ocean mammals legislation introduced by Sen-
ator Harris and support its general objectives. However, since this
measure was drafted, several problems have come to my attention which
justify a change and improvement in the language of the measure. In

any event, I shall most certainly do what I can to work for passage of this
measure.

As a member of the Subcommittee on Agricultural Appropriations, you
may be assured that I shall give the funding request for the animal wel-
fare program my most sympathetic consideration. I believe it would be
most unfortunate if this program was not implemented due to a lack of
funds.

Thank you for writing and sharing your views with me.

As you are probably aware, this bill passed the House of Representatives
on May 17, 1971. This bill is presently pending before the Senate
Commerce Committee. No hearings on the measure have as yet been _
scheduled. S. 78, of which I am a COSponsor, is also a legislative
attempt to curtail the practice of shooting animals from aircraft

by establishing penalties for such actions.

You may be interested to learn that identical legislation was passed
by the House of Representatives and was reported out of the Senate
Commerce Committee during the 9lst Congress. Unfortunately, due to

a heavy legislative schedule at the end of the session, the Senate

did not take action on the measure prior to the final adjournment

of Congress. In view of these facts, I feel that the prospects for
enactment of this measure during this session of Congress are good.

You may be assured that I will continue my efforts to expedite passage
of this legislation.

Thank you for writing and sharing your views with me. Your interest
and concern are appreciated.
