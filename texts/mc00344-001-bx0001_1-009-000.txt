You know the problem. The excitable,

Sparine has a taming effect on animals . . .
helps calm them during handling,
examination, even surgical procedures.
Shipment is made more easily with
Sparine, and it reduces the need for
mechanical restraints that may cause
injury.

INJECTION TABLETS

SPARINE? PROMAZINE HCI) WYETH

TO CALM
AND CONTROL

 

|I57

Indications: To control agitation, excitation, and
aggressiveness, and to facilitate physical or radiographic
examination and treatment; as anesthetic adjunct or to
replace general anesthetic (with local anesthetic); control of
unruly, hyperexcitable and/or nervous dogs; adjunctive use
in equine tetanus, colic and azoturia.

Warning: Not for use in animals which are raised for food
production.

Precautions: Exercise particular caution in presence of
debilitation, cardiac disease, sympathetic blockade,
hypovolemia, shock and general anesthesia. Too rapid IV
injection or accidental intracarotid injection (especially in
horses) can cause disorientation, convulsive seizures,
cardiovascular collapse and death. Do not use with
organophosphates (toxicity may be potentiated) or procaine
hydrochloride (activity may be increased). If a vasopressor
is needed, use norepinephrine or neosynephrine; do not use
epinephrine since promazine may reverse its action. Like all
phenothiazines, promazine may stimulate rather than depress
(symptomatic treatment and IV dextrose supportively and to
encourage physiologic detoxification are recommended).
Prolonged depression or motor restlessness may occur in
sensitive animals or with excessive dosage.

Adverse Reactions: Reported adverse reactions include one
apparent anaphylactic reaction to IV use, with recovery
(pony); irritation and swelling at lM injection site (horse);
drug idiosyncrasy (horses).

Effect of Prolonged Administration: Slight growth
depression in rats at high feeding levels (none in dogs); in
male rats, also, slight but significant increase in gross

weight of livers and spleens. Pituitaries, adrenals and gonads
in rats of both sexes increased in weight; in males, the
thymus decreased. At higher levels in rats, slight depression
of polymorphonuclear leucocyte count; none in dogs and
none in rats at lower dosages.

Supplied: Injection (for IM or IV use)—vials of 30 and 100 cc.
Each cc. contains 50 mg. promazine HCI with sodium citrate
buffer and not more than 1 mg. sodium formaldehyde
sulfoxylate. Tablets—25, 50 and 100 mg. promazine HCI,

vials of 50.

ALPO announces
basrc research to answer
some basrc que strons.

 

GUESSWORK JUST ISN’T ENOUGH. Where the well-being of
somebody’s pet is concerned, speculation, opinion or guesswork just isn’t
enough. Today’s veterinarian needs all the hard, unbiased, scientiﬁcally sup-
ported information he can get.

WHAT ARE THE QUESTIONS? 1s carbohydrate really needed?
How much protein is enough? What is the inﬂuence of vitamins and speciﬁc
amino acids on the resistance of dogs to disease? To explore these questions,
ALPO Pet Foods announces two major three-year study grants. ALPO is fund-
ing this research, not directing it. All results will be published by the investi-
gators with no editorializing by ALPO. Because we’re as interested in ﬁnding
out the facts as you are. 1

AT THE CORNELL RESEARCH LABORATORY for Diseases
of Dogs, a $157,000 research grant is studying nutritional requirements of dogs.
The principal investigator is Ben E. Sheﬂy, Ph.D., Professor of Nutrition and
Assistant Director of that laboratory. Co-investigator is George Lust, Ph.D.,
Assistant Professor of Biochemistry. The research objective is to determine the
carbohydrate requirement of dogs and the optimum protein requirements with
special emphasis on protein-calorie ratios. The study will include evaluation for
all stages of the life-cycles.

AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA School of Veteri-
nary Medicine, a $110,000 study grant is supporting basic research in experi-
mental and clinical renal failure in dogs. The research is directed by Kenneth C.
Bovee, D.V.M., M. Med. 50., Assistant Professor of Medicine and Chief, Section
of Medicine and David S. Kronfeld, M.V.Sc., Ph.D., Professor of Nutrition.
The objective here is to determine the inﬂuence of various dietary protein levels
on renal function and metabolic disturbance of renal function.

These two studies are expected to make signiﬁcant contributions to
veterinary knowledge. We at ALPO sincerely hope so. And we intend to con-
tinue making research grants such as these. Because a guess isn’t good enough.

We all know that.

BO-ANA

forthe control of

cattle grubs and sucking lice

BO-ANA® famphur is a cholinesterase inhibitor
that destroys cattle grubs and sucking lice
when used as directed.

The dosage is one ounce BO-ANA famphur
per 200 lb. body weight, poured on the back.
That means a dose cost of about 23¢ for a
GOO-lb. steer.

Test results show no setback to cattle when

used as directed. Cattle continue to gain
normally.

Tissue concentrations of famphur reach a
maximum approximately 14 days post-admini-
stration with trace residues at 28-35 days. As
a result, one application breaks the sucking
louse life cycle.

BO-ANA is packaged in 1 gallon cans. For
more information see your PVP supplier or
write: PROFESSIONAL VETERINARY PHAR-
MACEUTICALS, American Cyanamid Com-

pany, P.O. Box 400, Princeton, N. J. 08540.

Precautions: Treatment within .4
to 6 weeks of grub emergence is

of little value and may result in
toxic effects due to killing of ,mi-

men .

Do not use BO-ANA Pour-0n to
treat calves less than 3 months
old, or to treat lactating dairy
cows or dry cows within 21 days
of freshenlng.

Do not treat animals stressed from
castration, overexcntement or de-

o—Vac® I. System.

Twenty-t wo ways better.

The Abbott Professional Veterinary line now
includes 22 different |.V. fluids and blood
transfusion equipment prepared and labeled
especially for veterinary use. From simple
hydrating and balanced polyelectrolyte, to
special solutions to meet your every need.

And, the new Abbo-Vac I.V. System offers
you the ultimate in convenience, simplicity as
well as security.

Abbo-Vac solutions are sealed under vacu—
um with a completely closed rubber stopper.
To start the system, simply shut off the screw
clamp on the administration set, insert the
Venoset® cannula into the “bulls eye” in the
center of the solid stopper, and invert the flask
to automatically fill the flexible drip chamber.
There are no air-way needles to insert or worry
of splashback with the Abbo-Vac System. The

cannula has built-in air and fluid pathways. Air

enters the flask through the Teflon air filter
attached to the Venoset. And the filter is easily
removed So medications can be added di-
rectly through the air inlet using a syringe
without needle. '

No leakage or splashback will occur be-
cause the Venoset has Abbott’s exclusive
ball-check valve.The Venoset is also equipped
with a latex rubber and/ or “Y”-type injection
sites. These multiple sites for additives make
the Abb’o-Vac System extremely versatile.

Your Abbott veterinary distributor repre-
sentative will be happy to supply you with
more information or demonstrate the new
Abbo-Vac |.V. system at your convenience.

Factor V Deficiency and
Thrombocytopenia

January 24, 1972
Dear Sir:

As a veterinarian with extensive ex-
perience in the study of comparative
hemostasis, I feel compelled to comment
about a recent article in the JOURNAL
(Prasse et al., “Factor V Deﬁciency and
Thrombocytopenia in a Dog with Adeno-
carcinoma” (Jan. 15, 1972): 204). I
would like to commend the authors for
their report of a case of disseminated in-

travascular coagulation (DIC). However,
the best laboratory evidence available
from the report which supports this diag-
nosis is the combination of thrombo-
cytopenia with hypoﬁbrinogenemia.

Deﬁciency of factor V, which is not
necessarily diagnostic of BIG, has been
emphasized in this paper. I feel, there-
fore, that a title of “Chronic Intravascu-
lar Coagulation” or “Consumption
Coagulopathy in a Dog with Adeno-
carcinoma” would have been more ap-
propriate. Although the authors attrib-
uted their data from assays with a
commercial kit to a factor V deﬁciency,
the results are equally consistent with
combined deﬁciency of both factors V
and VIII. This possibility strengthens
the diagnosis of BIG, because it would be
expected that both factors V and VIII
would be reduced.

Unfortunately, no quantitative data
from these assays were provided. In the
event of multiple coagulation defects, the
interpretation based on results obtained
with certain types of commercial kits (as
shown in Table 3) can be misleading.
Additional speciﬁc coagulation factor as-
says would be necessary to establish and
quantitate the exact defects.

Finally, the comment made by the
authors that “deﬁciency of factor V may
have been a sequela to thrombocyto-
penia, which implies that factor V origi-
nates from platelets,” is erroneous.
Whereas it is knoWn that factors I
ﬁbrinogen), XIII, and possibly VIII are
found within platelets, all coagulation
factors are adsorbed onto the platelet
surface from the plasma. The question
whether intraplatelet coagulation factors

Who ('1) Stopped VEE?

Dear Sir:

The editorial, “Who Stopped VEE?”
in the February 15 issue of the JOURNAL
is in error. The vaccine which was used
to stop the recent outbreak of VEE was
not the vaccine that was developed dur-
ing World War II, primarily for the
protection of laboratory workers. That
vaccine was a chicken embryo formalin-
inactivated vaccine. The vaccine used in
the outbreak is an attenuated liver-virus
tissue-culture vaccine that was developed
by personnel of the US. Army Medical
Unit at Fort Detrick, Maryland, in the
late ’50’s and the ’60’s as part of a pro-
gram sponsored by the U.S. Army Medi-
ical Department for the development of
agents for the protection of personnel
and the civilian population against in-
fectious disease agents.

Bryan, Texas 77801

[EDITOR’S NOTE: According to Robert
Gillette in Science (July 30, 1971), “If
the combined forces of the Public Health
Service and the Agriculture Department
do succeed in curbing or even‘ halting the
VEE outbreak, much of the credit will
be due a pair of rather silent partners
in the battle. The partners are the US.
Army, which is furnishing the vaccine,
and, ironically enough, the Army’s pro-
gram of biological warfare, which de-
veloped the vaccine.

VEE in the Western Hemisphere,’ an
Army spokesman said. ‘It can be con-

BRIEF SUMMARY
(For full prescribing information, see package
circular.)

Ayerst. PRIMIDONE

VETERINARY

INDICATIONS: Use only in dogs to treat: idiopathic
epilepsy, epileptiform convulsions, virus encepha-
litis, distemper, hardpad disease.

Primidone has not proved useful in the treatment
of chorea.

WARNING: For use only in dogs.
PRECAUTIONS: DO NOT use IN FELINE SPECIES.
Primidone is not recommended for use in the cat,
because it appears to have, as do many other com-
pounds, a specific neurotoxicity for this species.

ADVERSE REACTIONS: Primidone is well tolerated
at effective therapeutic levels. Side reactions such
as staggering and drowsiness occur infrequently
and usually disappear with adjustment in dosage.
One reported case of laboratory-confirmed mega-
Ioblastic anemia was successfully treated with
folic acid, vitamin B”, and iron.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: USUAL DAILY
DOSAGE—25 mg./lb. of body weight. The initial
dose is gradually increased until optimum control
of convulsions is achieved, and the dosage level
necessary to establish this effect is usually main-
tained. When convulsions occur only every few
days, or less often, daily dosage should be given at
one time. Reduction in dosage should always be
made gradually and treatment should never be
discontinued abruptly.

Tablets may be administered whole, or crushed
and mixed with food. When convulsions are fre-
quent, the daily dosage should be divided and
administered at intervals.

HOW SUPPLIED: No. V430—Each tablet contains
250 mg. of primidone (scored), in bottles of 100
and 1,000.

Sales to veterinarians only. Available through your

A palatable

 

heartworm preventer

 

A lastly Wﬂl] to
prevent heartworms

There is now a heartworm preventive
available that dogs will accept immedi-
ately! And happily! It’s Dirocide from
Squibb.

Dirocide is given once a day in the dog’s
ration. Dogs have continually accepted
Dirocide-treated food even when given
consecutive daily doses for more than
three years.

Dirocide is effective and non-toxic at

the recommended (3 mg./|b. body.

weight per day) dose. Both field and
laboratory studies show no cumulative
toxic effect and, at the same time, Diro-
cide effectively prevented the matura-
tion of heartworms (D. immitis) in dogs.
You can start Dirocide protection in
puppies at two months.

Dirocide is a tasty way to prevent heart-
worms. lt’s a palatable preventer. Dis-
pense it with confidence.

Dirocide is available in

sidered a beneﬁcial result of biological
warfare research.’

“. . the Army’s involvement with
VEE extends back far beyond the 1960’s,
and it stems from motivations that orig-
inally had little to do with public service
and animal health. The Army’s research
on the virus began in earnest in 1943,
and thereafter followed two paths—one
to develop a defensive’vaccine for hu-
mans, the other to explore the feasibility
of using the virus offensively.

“Evidently this research was success-
ful in both respects. Despite initial fail-
ures in the 1940’s, the Army had pro-
duced by the 1960’s an effective vaccine
that worked in horses and humans alike.
As a bonus, its vaccine has come to
constitute a bit of beneﬁcial spinoff from

 

lbirotide

(Diethylcarbamazine Citrate Syrup)

Indications: For use in dogs for the prevention of
infection with Dirofilaria immitis.

Warnings: Dogs should be proven negative for
the presence of D. immitis or rendered negative
by using adulticidal and microfilariacidal drugs
before administering this drug.

Precautions: While studies have shown that
dogs infected with D. immitis had no untoward
effects from daily administration of 3 mg. /lb. of
body weight for one year, the use of diethylcar-
bamazine citrate syrup is NOT RECOMMENDED
IN DOGS ACTIVE WlTH D. immitis INFECTIONS.
This infection is a serious disease involving vital
organs, and treatment of an established D. im-
mitis infection involves a degree of risk In all cases.
NOTE: The activity of diethylcarbamazine citrate
against the other most common dog filariae,
Dipetalonema reconditum, is not known.

How supplied: As a palatable syrup containing 60
mg. Diethylcarbamazine Citrate U. S. P. per co. in
plastic jugs of one gallon.

Caution: Federal law restricts this drug to use
by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.

Vet-Aid's Launching Prose

March 3, 1972
Dear Sir:

I have been in small animal practice
for 10 years and I have no argument with
the Vet-Aid structure (News article,
“Vet—Aid in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Feb. 15,
197 2), though it is obviously not charity
nor does it seem to even be unproﬁtable
for the veterinarians involved. I do ob-
ject to the description of Vet-Aid’s
launching, written with soapish prose:

“Do they let it suffer? Do they beg
or throw themselves on the mercy of the
veterinarian?” And so forth. This sort
of reporting sounds more ﬁtting for True
Confessions. It is easy to imagine a car-
toon with the veterinarian standing over
a groveling client. He is thinking, “With-
out a federal or state program to help
him, what can he do?”

I do not believe the J.A.V.M.A. has
to present these mawkish arguments to
inform other professionals of the “heart-
ache and headaches” of the indigent.
Charity on an individual level has no
need of bouquets. I am in accord with
Dr. Merrick’s intentions but I fear some
editorializing has made his feelings sound
unrealistic. Surely there is mercy in our
profession without belaboring the point.

NEWS FROM
WASHINGTON . . . .

 

 

 

 

USAHA State-Federal Relations Committee Meets

in Washington

During the week of March 6, the United States Animal Health Asso-
ciation State-Federal Committee held its annual meeting in Washington to
discuss the operations and funding of cooperative state-federal programs
relating to animal disease control and meat and poultry inspection.

The USAHA Committee consisted of:

Dr. W. C. Tobin, State Veterinarian, Colorado (President-elect, USAHA-
Chairman)

Dr. J. C. Shook, Department of Agriculture, Pennsylvania (President,
USAHA)

Mr. Olin H. Timm, Livestock Industry, California (First vice president,
USAHA)

Dr. W. D. Mitchell, State Veterinarian, South Dakota (Immediate past
president, USAHA)

Dr. J. H. Brashear, State Veterinarian, Oklahoma

Dr. H. W. Tower, State Veterinarian, Delaware

Dr. J. F. Andrews, State Veterinarian, Georgia

Dr. W. Bendix, State Veterinarian, Virginia (Secretary-treasurer,
USAHA)

Dr. F. A. Todd, AVMA Representative

The current regulating programs of the Department were reviewed and
future needs and changes were discussed. The Committee prepared a report
for its own association supporting the majority of programs but using the
opportunity to reemphasize certain programs that are of concern to the
states. The trends of relocation of livestock patterns in the country have
developed new disease problems in areas where they were not serious in the
past. As an example, atrophic rhinitis is becoming a serious problem to the
southeastern states.

 

Veterinary Services

Among the items reviewed in this area, the Committee urged that the
Department use every means available through publicity and educational
programs to prevent complacency among the livestock producers and regu-
latory agencies at the particular step in the country’s hog cholera eradication
efforts. As the goal is approached, each new outbreak becomes more impor-
tant. For a successful conclusion, all parties will have to cooperate to the

fullest.

WASHINGTON NEWS—from page 1168

The Committee was informed by the Department that as of April 1, 40
states would be free of hog cholera.

The Committee strongly supported Secretary Butz’s recent statement
for renewed efforts to eradicate brucellosis in the United States by Jan. 1,
1976.

The Committee likewise urged that a program to eradicate the current
outbreak of exotic Newcastle disease in southern California be expedited. It
is estimated that the operation would cost approximately $7 million. This
would be a relatively small sum to invest in a disease as serious as this one,
that could spread to the multibillion dollar poultry and turkey industries of
this country. It was emphasized that the eradication program must be
coupled with the control of the importation of psitticine and other exotic

birds.

The Committee noted that the Department is placing emphasis on the
defense against foreign animal diseases. The outbreaks of VEE and exotic
Newcastle disease are examples that place emphasis on the importance of
this activity. The Department has a high priority on research for diagnostic
procedures concerning foreign animal diseases and on research on African
swine fever.

The Committee was reminded that livestock in the United States is

valued at about $40 billion. It is estimated that the annual loss of animals
and their food products from disease approaches $4 billion. Approximately
$40 million are spent annually on disease research, representing 0.01% of
the value of the industry.

The Committee was much concerned about and continually emphasized
the need for laboratory facilities for the testing for safety and purity of veter-
inary biological products. The Committee again strongly supported the
proposal that the laboratory at Fort Detrick, Md., be made available to
the veterinary biologics division for laboratory operations. The facilities
recommended (1) would provide adequate laboratory and animal space to
meet the needs of the division, (2) already exist, and (3) are ready for
immediate occupancy. The construction of a new laboratory would require
a minimum of 6 or 7 years, at a cost of several million dollars. Thus the
Fort Detrick facilities would provide a quick remedy for the cramped and
scattered laboratories presently occupied by the division and would save
taxpayers millions of dollars in planning, property acquisition, and building
costs.

The planned expansion of laboratory services for meat and poultry
inspection was strongly supported by the Committee.
The Committee voiced serious concern on the latest CMS-PHS regu-

lations effective February 14, requiring the cooking of cattle carcasses that
are either tuberculin reactors or contain localized lesions of tuberculosis.
The absence of canning facilities in most of the states and the problem of
disposing of suspected or reactor animals in marketing centers was dis-
cussed. The possibility of this new pr0posal providing serious obstacles in
the current TB control program was also discussed. The tightened regu-
lations will cause about 3,000 cattle and 76,000 swine to be “passed for

cooking.”

Sea Mammal Protection Legislation

On March 9, the House overwhelmingly passed the bill to protect ocean
and sea mammals. The bill would prohibit or severely limit the slaughter or
capture of marine animals such as seals, whales, sea otters, and polar bears
in those areas under United States jurisdiction. The bill would also. curb
the importation of these mammals into the United States. An amendment
to the bill would propose a 5-year moratorium on killing these mammals,
and would exclude the “taking” of mammals for science exhibits or under
treaty arrangements with other countries (see J.A.V.M.A., Nov. 1, 1971,
page 1070).

New Animal Welfare Regulations

The Federal Register for March 7 informed the public that the regu-
lations controlling the Animal Welfare Act would not at this time contain
requirements for mandatory exercise of laboratory animals. This decision
is based on the absence of deﬁnitive research to indicate that exercise for
animals should be a mandatory requirement. The Department has declared
that it intends to revise its regulations if and when factual information on
the relationship of exercise to the health and well being of the animal is
determined.

The same approach is being used with respect to space requirements for
captive wild animals. Information on special requirements for a large num-
ber and variety of warm-blooded animals covered by the act is not available
at this time.

Hog Cholera Outbreak in North Carolina

As the hog cholera eradication program approaches its goal, each new
isolated outbreak, with its resultant spread, becomes exceedingly important
and sets the program back for a period of time.

Hog cholera was found in North Carolina after the state had gone 8
months without a case. The disease killed 200 of 600 newly purchased swine
in a feeder-pig operation. All animals in the herd have been destroyed
and the county was placed under quarantine. Indemnities are being paid
to the owner. As of the middle of March, the source of infection had not
been determined.

The outbreak of hog cholera discovered in Texas on December 15 appears
to have been eradicated. In the Texas outbreak, 32 herds were infected and
153 exposed. Nearly 4,000 swine were destroyed in this outbreak.

The USDA has stated that, as of April 1, 40 states will be free of hog
cholera.

Updating Knowledge in Nutrition

During recent years the veterinary
profession has made enormous strides in
the prevention, control, eradication, and
treatment of animal diseases, mainly
through judicious use of drugs and bio-
logical agents, along with professional
advice on how to improve livestock man-
agement. Somewhat less has been ac-
complished in the application of newer
knowledge in nutrition as a means of
preventing or alleviating animal diseases,
despite the efforts of many veterinarians
to improve their knowledge through pro-
grams sponsored by colleges of agricul-
ture and the feed industry, and through
professional short Courses and published
literature. Unfortunately, short courses
on nutrition have been infrequent, and
the veterinary literature contains rela-
tively little about nutrition. We are al-
most as ignorant today as we were several
decades‘ago relative to the optimal needs
of animals. Our lack of knowledge about
excess levels of food ingredients and the
potential problems associated with them
is probably the largest gap in the science
of modern nutrition. This is reinforced
by recent continuing diﬂiculties with
“all-meat” diets for dogs where excessive
dietary protein creates serious problems.
Excessive levels of vitamins A and D
cannot be administered to man or ani-
mals for prolonged periods with im-
punity, so why should we feel that excess
protein, fat, or carbohydrate can be less
dangerous? These areas demand the at-
tention of nutritionists and veterinarians.

 

Prepared by Paul M. Newberne, D.V.M., Professor
of Nutritional Pathology, Department of Nutrition and
Food Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Cambridge, Mass. 02139.

Efforts to establish a better knowledge
of nutrition, and through such efforts a
better and more satisfying relationship
with nutritionists in our universities and
in the feed industry, are highly com-
mendable. Through such an approach we
can improve our capability to provide a
higher level of service to our clients,
which should be our major goal. Through
such efforts we may be able to resolve
some of the important problems of. food
animal production such as enteric
diseases in swine, liver abscesses, renal
disease, and bovine pneumonia in feedlot
operations, and many others clearly not
simple infectious disease entities, but
rather more complex entities involving

' nutritional factors.

Veterinarians should not overlook
direct contact with university and feed
industry nutritionists. They are highly
trained, experienced professionals who
know their jobs and who stand ready to
help the practicing veterinarian by the
simple expedient of a telephone call.
They can often help solve practical nu-
tritional problems encountered by the
veterinarian even though most of them
are trained and experienced in the basic
and applied aspects of classical nutrition
where investigations are conducted in
highly controlled environments with di-
etary ingredients the major variable. In-
teractions of infectious diseases receive
little if any attention.

Credit for research and development
in classical nutrition as applied to ani-
mals goes largely to the dedicated nutri-
tionists in the schools of agriculture and
in the agricultural experiment stations.

LEGAL BRIEF

 

 

 

 

 

 

Zoning Laws and the Veterinarian

What is zoning, what agencies can zone, and how might a veterinarian be
affected? ' .

Zoning is a local control of land use achieved by restricting the kinds 0
enterprises that can be carried on in speciﬁed areas of the zoned political entity
(a city, county, or township in a county not having county zoning). Ideally,
the zoning ordinance is based on a long-range development plan. The zoned areas
must be clearly mapped and the permitted and prohibited occupations expressed
as precisely as possible. Usual zones are “residential,” “commercial,” “industrial,”
and “agricultural.” These may be further divided into subzones (light industry
and heavy induStry, for example).

Animal hospitals and veterinary practices are likely to be excluded from the
residential zone. They may also be excluded from the commercial zone. There-
fore, a veterinarian seeking to establish himself in such a zone may ﬁnd that he
is blocked. Of course, if he is already there at the time the ordinance is adopted,
he may continue as a nonconforming user—providing he does not materially
change the nature of’ his enterprise or discontinue his business for some extended
period of time (6 months, for example). There is an additional strike against
the nonconforming use: though legally privileged to carry on, the veterinarian is
vulnerable to common law nuisance suits which may be commenced by offended
residential or commercial owners.

What can a veterinarian do when he wishes to build in an area where the
zoning ordinance does not permit? If he can show that he will not constitute a
nuisance, he may be able to get a variance or special use permit—or even a
modiﬁcation of the ordinance. Factors in his favor would be plans showing an
attractive building with enclosed runs and animal quarters, soundprooﬁng and
vermin prooﬁng; and statements from property owners adjoining a similar estab-
lishment elsewhere to the effect that they are not inconvenienced in any way
by it, and that their property values are not affected. If either local or state
public health permits are required they should of course be provided. If a veteri-
narian feels that the zoning ordinance is unduly restricted, he may try to get
it changed. As a last resort he can challenge the reasonableness of an ordinance
in court. Before doing so he must have ﬁrst sought relief from the zoning ofﬁcer
and the zoning board of appeals.

Illinois, Urbana, Ill. 61801.

The Executive Board of the American Association of Swine Practitioners

AASP Meets in Kansas City

The American Association of Swine
Practitioners met in Kansas City, Mo.,
March 21, for a scientiﬁc and business
meeting immediately preceding the 1972
annual meeting of the American Pork
Congress.

Dr. Wallace Brandt (ILL ’55), presi-
dent-elect, chaired the scientiﬁc portion
of the program, which was attended by
more than 100 members. The program
speakers dealt with selection of animal
type for optimal production, the mastitis-
metritis-agalactia syndrome, swabbing
and culturing techniques for Bordetella
bronchiseptica identiﬁcation, reproductive
physiology of the sow, and enteric dis-

eases of pigs.

May I, I972

Meeting Dates Established

In the Executive Board session, chaired
by Dr. Thomas Keefe (MO ’63), presi—
dent, it was agreed that the Association’s
principal business meeting, including EX-
ecutive Board deliberations, be held each
year in conjunction with the American
Pork Congress and that the Association
continue to have a general business ses-
sion at each annual AVMA meeting. At
the 1972 meeting of the AVMA in New
Orleans, a short postluncheon meeting
on July 18 is planned.

Dr. Allen Leman (ILL ’68), chairman
of the publications committee, was com-
mended for his efforts in disseminating
timely and useful information to mem-

H85

 

 




 

 

 

  
 

bers via a newsletter on a monthly or
near-monthly schedule. The Board asked
Dr. Leman, and he agreed, to represent
the AASP at the International Pig Con-
gress to be held in Hannover, Germany,
May 23—26, 1972. The congress is a
periodic function of the International
Pig Veterinary Society.

The Board reafﬁrmed the previous posi-
tion of the Association that AVMA mem-
bership be required for AASP member-
ship.

A committee appointed to study
Executive Board makeup recommended
that the Executive Board be comprised
of at least one member from each of 11

Honorary Lifetime Membership

Dr. H. C. Kernkamp (OSU i14), Uni-
versity of Minnesota, was elected to hon-
orary lifetime membership in the Asso-
ciation—~the ﬁrst such membership
granted by the Association.

Executive Board members and the gen-
eral membership engaged in a spirited
discussion on procedures of meat inspec-
tion and monitoring of residues of exoge-
nous chemical compounds in imported

express its concern through appropriate
channels to the effect that standards of
meat inspection and monitoring of tissue
residues in imported pork be at least
equal to standards applied for pork pro-
duced domestically.

Nominations for vacant Executive
Board seats and for president-elect and
for secretary-treasurer were made, but
elections were deferred until the sched-
uled meeting at New Orleans, July 18.

Rapid Membership Growth

Enthusiasm for continued growth of this
Association was reﬂected in the com-
ment from a charter member. “We’ve
come a long way since our beginning 3
years ago, when 20 interested persons
started the organization,” he said. “The
key to gaining additional members has

   

been and will continue to be the pro-
vision of sound continuing education pro-
grams for private practitioners.”

The delegate and alternate delegate to
the AVMA House of Delegates are Dr.
James Bailey (ISU ’46) and Dr. Brandt,
respectively.

Council Completes Guidelines
on Pet Cemeteries and Precepteeships

Guidelines on veterinary ownership and
operation of pet cemeteries and crema-
tories were completed by the AVMA
Council on Veterinary Service, March
6—7, following the Judicial Council’s
determination that veterinarians may
ethically participate in such activities.
Stating that such involvement does
not enhance the public image of veteri-
nary medicine, the Council nevertheless
recognized that disposal of deceased pets
in communities poses a critical problem,
making it in the public interest to provide
a crematory or burial service.

Ideally, the enterprise should be a
business entity completely separated from
the veterinary practice, the guidelines
state. When a veterinarian does not make
a business of the enterprise, providing the
service only on request, he should not
advertise the service in any way. If he
renders a disposal, burial, or cremation
service, he should take special care to
avoid creating the impression that veteri—
narians are caretakers of the dead as well
as the living. He should also take into
consideration that pet owners frequently
View burial and cremation of pets in hu-
man terms. The guidelines provide sug-
gestions on how to handle this matter
so that the pet owner is not deceived. A
proposal on the handling of perpetual

|l88

    

care is also included in the guidelines,
which will be submitted to the AVMA
Executive Board and the House of Dele-
gates at their next meetings.

Precepteeship Guidelines

Another set of guidelines drawn up by
the Council at its spring meeting in
March was on precepteeship programs.
The guidelines cover all aspects of these
programs, including the selection of pre-
ceptors, composition of the preceptorship
committee, ﬁnancing, duties of the pre-
ceptee, responsibilities of the preceptor,
evaluations, and beneﬁts. The guidelines
urge that leadership in determining the
qualiﬁcations of practicing veterinarians
selected as preceptors be accepted by the
preceptorship committee, consisting of
representives of state veterinary medical
associations, veterinary college alumni,
and veterinary college faculty.

To make the precepteeship program
meaningful, the Council suggests the
need for periodic evaluation by both the
preceptor and preceptee and by the pre-
cepteeship committee.

Animal Technician Training Programs

A 12-point statement on animal tech-
nician training programs was developed
for presentation to the Executive Board

cil expresses strong support for the
development of an AVMA plan of ac-
creditation of animal technician training
programs and proposes that the responsi-
bility for such programs be assigned to
the Council on Education.

The statement recommends the in-
volvement of state veterinary medical

associations to assess the need for animal
technicians Within their state, to develop
registration and continuing education
programs for animal technicians, and to
assume leadership in amending state
practice acts, where necessary, to permit
animal technicians to be employed by
practitioners.

mended study of the problem by the
Judicial Council. It also recommended
that animal technician training programs
and their accreditation be studied by
American Animal Hospital Association,
American Association of Equine Practi-
tioners, American Association of Bovine

groups.

Environmental Quality

The Council reviewed again its assign-
ment from the Executive Board on en-
vironmental quality and continued to
grapple with this monumental problem.

Hea rtworm Disease Committee
Appointed

The following committee was appointed
to develop standard procedures for the
treatment and prevention of canine heart-
worm disease: Drs. Ronald Jackson
(MSU ’40), St. Augustine, Fla., chair-
man; Dallen H. Jones (WSU ’41), Rose-
burg, Ore.; Jesse W. Henderson, Jr.
(TEX ’52), Port Arthur, Texas; and
Jack D, Noyes (ILL ’59), Barrington,
Ill.

Workmen’s Compensation Rates

In its continued discussion of the prob-
lem of state rates for workmen’s compen-
sation, the Council was informed that
the 1969 rate schedule had been dis-
tributed to secretaries of all state veteri-
nary medical associations, with a com-
pilation of payrolls, premiums, and total
losses. The latter includes both indem-
nity and medical losses by states over a
3-year period.

AVMA Mastitis Committee Report

Several items in the report of the
AVMA Mastitis Committee received spe-
cial attention by the Council. The com-
mittee’s statement to the Food and Drug
Administration concerning prescription
status of mastitis remedies was approved

”90

  

and strongly supported. The statement
suggests the kind of remedies which
might be made available over the counter
and the kind which should have prescrip-
tion labeling.

The Council recommended that the
committee’s question concerning the
average practitioner’s ability to evaluate
mastitis in the herd be brought to the
attention of the American Association of
Bovine Practitioners and American Asso-
ciation of Veterinary Clinicians. It also
recommended that continuing education
programs on mastitis control and treat-
ment be sponsored by local and state
associations to assist practitioners in
keeping up to date on the subject. '

Pet Care for Indigent Clients

AVMA staff reported that replies re-
ceived to date from a Council-sponsored
survey on the alleged need of medical
care for pets of indigent persons and pos-
sible solutions indicated that there is a
vast divergence of methods being used to
handle this problem. The survey, sent to
veterinary medical associations and afﬁli-
ates of the American Humane Society
in nine of the largest cities in the United
States, asked the questions: (1) How is
indigency determined in your city? and
(2) What is your program? Cities sur—
veyed were: New York, Chicago, Los
Angeles, Philadelphia, Detroit, Houston,
Baltimore, Dallas, and Indianapolis. A
full report on the results of the survey
will be reported at the next meeting when
all replies are in.

The Council’s next meeting will be
Oct. 30—31, 1972.

Fishing? You may be a dedicated
angler or never have had a ﬁshing rod in
your hands before. But if you will be
in New Orleans for the AVMA annual
meeting, July 18—20, you’ll want to try
your hand at ﬁshing in Louisiana. The
state boasts unsurpassed, year-round ﬁsh-
ing in both fresh and salt waters. Fish-
ing regulations and license fees are
among the most liberal in the country,
and you’re almost certain to return
home with a catch.

Fishing the Fresh Water

The diversiﬁed terrain of Louisiana,
from coastal marshes to pine lands and
hardwood stands, is covered by thou-
sands of miles of rivers, lakes, streams,
and bayous. Scores of areas through-
out the state offer supreme ﬁshing
grounds.

The fresh-water angler may ply his
hobby to a backdrop of oak-shaded
banks and trees dripping with trailing
Spanish moss. Or perhaps the spot
might be a cypress-studded inland lake
where big bass lurk under the deeply
hued water hyacinths. The fringes of the
coastal waters from Mississippi to
Texas—the lakes, bays, and bayous—
have been favorite spots of ﬁshermen for
years. From there they have returned
home with full “croaker sacks,” the term
originating when ﬁshermen ﬁnished the
day’s catch with sacks literally ﬁlled with
tasty, scrappy croakers.

The Fresh Water Catch

Largemouth Bass—There is no closed
season on this ﬁsh. It is distributed
Widely throughout the state, and count-
less bayous, lakes, and streams offer a
rich catch. The state record for the ﬁsh
is 11 1b., 11 oz.

CrappiemBoth white and black crappie
are Widely distributed in the state. In
southern Louisiana they are called “sac-

a-lait,” or sack of milk; in northern
Louisiana they are referred to as “white
perch.” The state record is 6 lb.

Bluegill—These ﬁsh are called “perch”
or “bream” in Louisiana. The largest
caught was 2 1b., 8 oz. in 1959. Bluegills
can be found in any body of the state’s
fresh water.

Among other ﬁsh in coastal waters,
you’ll ﬁnd speckled trout, white trout,
croakers, redﬁsh, sheepshead, channel
mullet, ﬂounder, drum, and tarpon. ‘

Toledo Bend Country

A special spot of interest to the fresh-
water ﬁsherman is the Toledo Bend Res-
ervoir. Although only slightly more than
2 years old, the lake has already become
famous around the country. Forming a
portion of the boundary between Louisi-
ana and Texas, the reservoir extends ap—
proximately 65 miles from the dam site
at Sabine Parish, La., up river to Logans-
port, La. It is the largest man-made body
of water in the South, having a surface
area of 196,000 acres and 1,200 miles of
shoreline.

Guides are available, but marina op-
erators will be happy to supply you with
tips on where to ﬁsh and lures to use.

Here is only a sample of the many
facilities offering lodging or camping and
boating facilities:

Toledo Bend Marina—1V2 miles north
of Dam Scenic Dr., boat rental, food,
camping facilities, bait, gas and oil: Ana-
coco, La.

Looking to the Sea

It would seem Louisiana has beneﬁted
doubly from the discovery of petroleum
off its shore. Income is realized for leases
and royalties of the operations. And the
rigs themselves have expanded the al-
ready booming ﬁshing business. The
waters of the Gulf have always been a
favorite of anglers, but now in the areas
of the offshore oil and sulfur platforms,
ﬁshing has become a virtual bonanza.

The structures are found everywhere
but in the extreme eastern Louisiana
waters. For the more than 75 charter
boats, the rigs are daily ports of call.

Your Catch in the Gulf

Pompano serve as a ﬁne example of
the new catch in the Gulf. Plentiful else-
where for years, they began moving into
Louisiana’s coastal waters. The schools
now congregate around the offshore
structures, where red snapper have also
been appearing in tremendous numbers.

Spearﬁshing is at its best around the
rigs. Skindivers, swimming under the
rigs, encounter masses of jewﬁsh, some
weighing more than 500 1b., crouper,
cobia, snapper, barracuda, and amber-
jack.

In the Gulf, protective land extends
100 miles out into the water. This puts
ﬁshermen within 10 miles of deep water
and a chance to go after the big ones.
They ﬁnd huge blue marlin, white mar-
lin, sailﬁsh, and tuna.

The Salt Water Catch

Game salt water ﬁsh to be caught in
the Gulf include:

Blue M arlin—They are taken in the Gulf out
of South Pass, Grand Isle, and Empire. The
state record is 686 lb.

Sailﬁsh—Highly prized for mounting, the ﬁsh
is abundant from South Pass west to Texas.
Best months are July through October. Record
in the state is 96 lb.

White M arlin—The state record is 134 1b. Mar-
lin are taken in Gulf waters out of South Pass,
Grand Isle, and Empire where large concen-

trations are found from May until early Oc-
tober.

Yellowfin Tuna—Abundant out of South Pass
and around the mouth of the Mississippi River.
The record is 196 1b., 8 oz.

Bull Dolphin—The ﬁsh are taken all along the
Louisiana coast, but are most abundant out of
South Pass, Grand Isle, and Empire. In season
from mid-June until October, the largest caught
was 59 1b., 12 oz.

Tarpon—May begins the tarpon season, which
lasts until early October. Large schools are
found around the passes of the Mississippi
and westward to the Texas State line. The state
record is 198 1b., 8 oz.

Pompano—Considered the prince of ﬁsh, pom-
pano is prized for its ﬁghting ability on light
tackle and for its delicious taste. Eight 1b.,
8 oz. is the record.

Cobia—The state record is 149 1b., 12 oz. The
ﬁsh begin appearing in coastal waters in May
and the catch is excellent all along the Louisi—
ana coast.

Red Snapper—Having a tendency to school
around offshore oil-drilling platforms, the breed
is a bottom-feeding ﬁsh. Seventy-four pounds
is the record.

Georgia Veterinary Scientists Implement
NOAA Sea Grant Program

While many look toward outer space
as the ultimate answer to man’s future
resources, scientists at the University of
Georgia and other units of the University
System are delving into inner space——
the sea and the fertile estuaries. Funded
by the Office of Sea Grant in the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA), in the Department of Com-
merce, these scientists are exploring
Georgia’s coastline and its marine life
as a source of food for the earth’s grow-
ing population.

Veterinarians Involved

Veterinarians at the University’s Col-
lege of Veterinary Medicine are involved
in an investigation of one of the major
problems confronting future aquaculture
programs—the diseases and parasites
of marine life. In an effort to uncover
these potential threats to culture pro-
grams, studies of disease and parasite
occurrence in marine life under natural
environmental conditions and the effects
of these elements on marine life main-
tained under crowded culture conditions
are being performed. Participating in the
Sea Grant Program are Dr. J. Thomas
Bell (GA ’52), head of the Department
of Anatomy and Histology; Dr. Fred G.
Smith (PUR ’67), an anatomist and his-
tologist stationed at Sapelo Island, Ga. ;
and Mr. William Brown, a research assis-
tant. Microbiological studies are being
performed by Dr. John B. Gratzek (MIN
’56), head of the Department of Medical
Microbiology; Dr. Emmett B. Shotts;
and Mr. Richard Rimler, a research
assistant.

Survey Diseases of Marine Fish

Prior to the implementation of the
Sea Grant Program, Dr. Smith conducted

”96

a survey of diseases and parasites of
marine ﬁsh in their natural environ-
ment—the unpolluted fertile estuaries of
Sapelo Island. Data accumulated through
his surveys and necropsies of thousands
of ﬁsh resulted in the establishment of
computerized information on the natu-
rally occurring parasites of marine life
in their native environment. At the
same time, experimental plots were con-
structed by other investigators from the
University of Georgia to determine the
role of the estuaries in the cycle of
marine life and the effect of diking on
the balance of nature in these salt water
marshes. Phases of this program still
continue.

When the Sea Grant Program was
initiated in May, 1971, the veterinary
research workers were ready to move
into the second phase of their investiga-
tion—the determination of diseases and
parasites occurring under culture con-
ditions. Culture programs of shrimp and
ﬂounder were implemented at the Skida-
way Institute of Oceanography, a Uni-
versity System research facility located
near Savannah, Ga.

Special Project on White Shrimp

A special project being conducted by
the veterinary research workers involves
the study of the anatomic and histo-
logic aspects of the digestive system
of the white shrimp. The normal histol-
ogy of the digestive system was selected
for initial study because of possible im-
plications on the nutritional studies being
conducted by other Sea Grant partici-
pants. These studies also will offer in-
sight into a comparison of the normal
and abnormal histology of the shrimp’s

constructed to maintain white shrimp
under varying temperature conditions
simulating those ﬂuctuations found in
the estuaries. This project is being un-
dertaken to determine the effect of tem-
perature variations on the development
and morphology of the shrimp’s diges-
tive tract.

“We know from other investigators
that temperature changes markedly af-
fect the immunologic response of ani-
mals. With the aid of the veterinary
microbiologists, we will be studying the
immunologic responses that occur in
the shrimp under various temperatures
as well as observing their feeding habits,”
explains Dr. Bell. Since shrimp currently
constitute the major portion of Georgia’s
ﬁsh industry, their ﬁndings could have
a decided impact on the state’s economy.

It has been estimated that man cur-
rently derives only 2 to 3% of his total
calories from the sea. And yet 70% of
the solar energy (the ultimate source
of all food) reaching earth falls on the
oceans. The applied research made pos-
sible through the Sea Grant Program
could provide insight into maximum utili-
zation of this expansive and largely un-
tapped food reservoir.

Three New Jersey Veterinarians
Honored by State Association

Three awards to New Jersey veteri—
narians were presented at the annual
meeting of the New Jersey V.M.A.,
March 7—9, in Cherry Hill. Those hon-
ored were: Dr. Sam Pollock (MSU ’41),
Orange, N.J., who received the Practi-
tioners’ Award; Dr. David V. Tudor (UP
’51), Cranbury, who was presented the
Appreciation and Recognition Award;
and Dr. Robert R. Shomer (UP ’34),
Teaneck, recipient of the association’s
Distinguished Service Award. Dr.
John R. McCoy (UP ’40), outgoing pres-
ident, made the presentation.

Dr. Shomer, a small animal practi-
tioner, has been active for many years
in organized veterinary medicine and in
his community. Snce 1964, he has served
as New Jersey’s representative to the
AVMA House of Delegates, and he is
currently serving as a member of the
AVMA Executive Board’s Advisory Com-
mittee on Animal Technicians. He is
secretary of the Association of American
State Boards of Examiners of Veterinary
Medicine and served until recently as
secretary-treasurer of the Board of Vet-

New Officers

An excellent attendance of 201 veteri-
narians elected the following new ofﬁcers:
Drs. Richard A. Hartkopf (KSU ’56),
Westﬁeld, president; Marvin Rothman
(UP ’48), Collingswood, president-elect;

First Swine Health Day on
Illinois Campus a Success

On March 3, nearly 150 selected high-
volume pork producers, averaging 2,800
hogs marketed annually, and 45 veteri-
narians from nine states (Illinois, Indi-
ana, California, Nebraska, Kansas, Mich-
igan, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Wiscon-
sin) met at the University of Illinois
College of Veterinary Medicine for the
college’s ﬁrst Swine Health Day.

The meeting was set up to provide a

client education opportunity for Illinois

veterinarians, to acquaint Illinois pork
producers with college research efforts,
to pay tribute to Illinois pork producers
and the Illinois Department of Agricul-
ture for research funding, and to acquaint
college staff and students with producers
and their problems.

More than 260 people heard discus-
sions on disease control. The program
was highlighted by Dr. Kenneth B.
Meyer’s (ISU ’57) comments on the
“Producer Stress Syndrome,” Dr. Wal-
lace Brandt’s (ILL ’55) presentation on
“Fostering Better Client-Veterinary Re-
lations,” and a producer panel discussion
on “What I Want in Veterinary Service.”

Dr. Meyer, Purdue extension veteri-
narain, warned that dusts, gases, or other
unidentiﬁed factors in conﬁnement hog
houses may be responsible for respiratory
problems in producers and veterinarians.
He discussed the results of a recent In—
diana survey on the problem and told
the gathering that face masks designed
to eliminate dust particles do not always
eliminate the discomfort.

Dr. Brandt, president-elect of the
American Association of Swine Practi-
tioners, told registrants that “the biggest
factor in a veterinarian’s success is giving
the client more than he gives you.” His
deﬁnition of “something extra” includes:
deﬁnite appointments and a call when
late; a modern, itemized billing system;
a deﬁnite time each day for phone con-
sultation; a readiness to work when you
arrive on the farm; preventive medicine
programs and advice for clients; con-
tinuing education for clients with regular
meetings and newsletters; an intense in-
terest in the client’s livestock enterprise;
and participation in community affairs.

Swine Health Day was culminated by
ﬁve Illinois producers discussing veteri—
nary service. Perhaps Mr. Harold Coun-
cil summed up the panel’s feelings best
when he said “I’ll pay my vet for what
he knows, not what he does. I want him
to teach me to do the nursing.” The
theme throughout all the producers’ re-
marks was that they want a veterinarian
who is familiar with economics of pork

7th ACVS Meeting Initiates
Mark W. Allam Lecture

A program highlight of the 7th annual
meeting of the American College of Vet-
erinary Surgeons (ACVS) , February 2—4,
in Champaign, 111., was the ﬁrst Mark W.
Allam Lecture, presented by Dean W. W.
Armistead (TEX ’38), of Michigan State

the United States at veterinary and ca-
reer day programs. This exhibit was cited
for excellence by the AVMA.

Dr. Born practiced in Greendale, Wis.,
prior to moving to Fond du Lac in 1964,
where he is now the senior member of a
four-man practice.

Active in organized veterinary medical
organizations, he has served as president

of the Wisconsin Association of Equine
Practitioners, a committee member of the
new Animal Technician program in Madi-
son, Merit Badge counselor for both the
Girl Scout and Boy Scout troops in the
Fond du Lac area, and county 4-H leader
in the veterinary science program for the
past 4 years.

He has numerous illustrations in two
Veterinary textbooks, Canine Surgery
and Equine Surgery and Medicine and
is the author of The Canine, a veterinary
aid in anatomical transparencies, pub—
lished in 1967. As a consultant, he as-
sisted in the development of The Feline
in 1968 and The Horse in 1971. During
the past 2 years, Dr. Born has done il-
lustrations for various articles that Will
appear in the new publications soon to
be released on canine cardiology by the
American Animal Hospital Association.

Burr Beach Award

Dr. Ray Nachreiner (ISU ’66), Madi-
son, received the Burr Award for re-
search. He presented a paper on his work
with mastitis-metritis-agalactia (MMA) .
Dr. Nachreiner has almost completed
work on a Ph.D. degree at the University
of Wisconsin.

New Officers

The association elected two new of-
ﬁcers: Dr. Dennis J. Carr (ISU ’56),
Montfort, president; and Dr. Dale E.
Kelley (ISU ’51), Prairie du Sac, presi-
dent—elect. Total registration at the meet-
ing was 425, with 250 veterinarians.

Dr. Divers Appointed First
Full-Time Veterinarian of
Baltimore Zoo

Dr. Barbara J. Divers (WSU ’63) was
appointed on February 15 as the ﬁrst
full-time veterinarian in the 96-year his-
tory of the Baltimore Zoo.

Dr. Divers, who formerly worked as a
veterinary consultant to the Highland
Park Zoo in Pittsburgh, Pa., Willl have

J.A.V.M.A.. Vol. I60. No. 9

 




 

the responsibility of expanding the Balti-
more Zoo’s medical program and provid-
ing health care for the 200’s nearly 1,400
animals.

She will not be an employee of the
city of Baltimore, which owns and op-
erates the zoo, but is an employee of
the Baltimore Zoological Society. This
unique arrangement is the result of a
contract signed more than a year ago in
which the Society agreed to develop an
expanded animal medical program for the
zoo.

In the past, the zoo received veterinary
assistance on an “on-call” basis from local
practitioners and from veterinarians on
the staff of the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine. Funds to operate
the animal medical program will come
from the proceeds of admisssion charges
to- the zoo and from contributions from
individuals and foundations. In the con-
tract, the city agreed to collect admission
fees and to pay to the Society all pro-
ceeds for the purposes of the medical
program, for capital improvements, and
for animal purchases.

The Zoological Society’s Medical Com-
mittee, chaired by Dr. Robert A. Squire
(COR ’56), of the Department of Pa-
thology, Johns HOpkins University
School of Medicine, interviewed a num-
ber of candidates for the veterinary po-
sition. Dr. Divers was selected because
of her qualiﬁcations and competence in
zoology and clinical zoo medicine, Dr.
Squire said.

The 34-year-old veterinarian was born
in Tokyo, Japan, and received her BS.
degree from Montana State College in
1960, and her D.V.M. degree from the
College of Veterinary Medicine, Wash-
ington State University, in 1963.

For 5 years, from 1964 to 1969, she
was associated in the practice of Dr.
James H. Swart (UP ’49), of Pittsburgh,
Pa., with the primary responsibility for
the medical care of the animals in that
city’s Highland Park Zoo.

She was a teaching fellow in the De-
partment of Zoology, University of Mich-
igan, from 1969 to 1971 and recently re-
ceived her MS. degree in zoology from
that university.

May I, I972

In addition to her appointment at the
Baltimore Zoo, Dr. Divers received an
academic appointment in the division of
animal medicine at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine. Her
duties there will include both teaching
and research.

Colonel Elia Is Nominated
for Brigadier General

Colonel Charles V. L. Elia (TEX ’43),

installations. He also monitors the vet-
erinary inspection of foods procured for
Army use throughout the area, supervises
inspections of civil defense shelters, and
monitors inspection of food processing
establishments supplying the Army.

Twice Colonel Elia’s diverse capabili-
ties have been put to use in overseas
assignments. From 1952—1954 he was
assistant chief of the medical division
and veterinary consultant to the Greek
National Army under the Joint U.S.
Military Aid Group. From 1961—1962
he was in the Ryukyus Islands as deputy
director of the public health and welfare
department and veterinary consultant to
the high commissioner for the Ryukyus.

Colonel Elia has been station veteri-
narian for the Port of Embarkation at
Los Angeles; at Fort 0rd, Calif; Fort
Rosecrans, Calif; and Fort Chaffee, Ark.
He was chief of the professional planning
and programing branch in the Army sur-
geon general’s ofﬁce from 1954—1959;

the Johns Hopkins University School of
Hygiene and Public Health, and he holds
the coveted “A” preﬁx for excellence in
veterinary public health. He is a diplo-
mate of the American Board of Veteri-
nary Public Health and currently is serv-
ing as vice president of the board. He is
on the governing council of the Veteri-
nary Public Health Association.

Colonel Elia has held many positions
in the AVMA and was president of the
Alaska State V.M.A. when stationed in
that state. He is a member of the Amer-
ican Public Health Association, Inter-
national and Civil Affairs Health Society,
Association of Military Surgeons of the
United States, Association of the U.S.
Army, and the Conference of Public
Health Veterinarians.

Drugs and Animal Production
Theme of IVA Chicago Program

Prominent national authorities pre-
sented a comprehensive review and out—
look for the use of drugs in animal pro-
duction to veterinarians for 19 states
representing 38 manufacturers, at the
meeting of the Industrial Veterinarians’
Association, March 6—8, in Chicago, Ill.

If the increased demand for animal
protein is to be met, it was the con-
census of the speakers that the producers
must have available all medical technol-
ogy in the form of pesticides, antibiotics,
and chemicals for growth promotion and
disease control. It was recognized that
the safety of the consumer is paramount,
but the supercautious approach that is
being advocated today could lead to both
decreased production now and the in-
ability to meet the needs for tomorrow.

Dr. William Chalupa, ruminant nutri-
tionist from Smith Kline & French Lab-
oratories, pointed out that the ruminant,
instead of competing with man for vege-
table protein, can utilize roughage and
urea to produce the nitrogen necessary
for meat production. The immediate op-
portunity for increased production lies
in the discovery of new drugs to assist
in more efﬁcient and less costly ration
formulation.

Dr. M. L. Bowman, biologist, Mon-
mouth College, cited ﬁgures to show that
commercial ﬁsh culture is capable of pro-
ducing up to 3,000 lb. of protein per acre.
Fish culture is over 4,000 years old but
has only recently obtained serious re-
search attention. The need for research
and medication evaluation to improve
production and disease control is of
paramount importance if this source of
animal protein is to contribute to the
ever growing needs.

Dr. D. L. Bray, animal scientist at
the University of Illinois, and Dr. J. L.
Williamson, vice president of Ralston-
Purina Company, reviewed the research
over the last 25 years involving the use
of antibiotics as they relate to poultry
and red meat production. The evidence
they presented indicated that there has

been no decrease in the value of anti-
biotics as growth promotants and further
that no deﬁnitive data exist that the long
and continued use has produced patho-
genic strains of organisms resistant to
antibiotic therapy. Dr. Williamson pre-
sented ﬁgures showing that antibiotics
used at growth-promotion levels resulted
in a one-half billion dollar savings per
year in the cost of meat production.

“Is research in animal health produc-
tion justiﬁed?” asked Dr. T. P. Carney,
senior vice president of G. D. Searle &
Company. The high cost of the discovery
and development of new products will
restrict these efforts to those companies
with large resources and the ability to
develop accidental ideas coming from
planned research programs. Citing a $3
billion loss in livestock production, he
urged that new models and direction be
developed to discover agents to alleviate
the diseases contributing to these losses.

On the subject of “Residues: Impact
on Product Development,” Dr. L. E. Har-
ris, of Harris Laboratories, pointed out
that the time required for the develop-
ment of tissue residue information was
the most frequent reason for the delay
in ﬁlling new drug applications. He em-
phasized, in this day of consumerism,
that veterinarians knowledgeable of the
impact of the use of drugs in animal feeds
take every opportunity to make the pub-
lic aware of their contribution to the
production of safe and wholesome food.
He expressed the belief that it is the re-
sponsibility of the FDA to get as many
medications to the market as possible to
protect the livestock population, insure
our food supplies, and protect mankind.

Dr. Harry C. Mussman (KSU ’65),
director of the Laboratory Service Di-
vision of the Meat and Poultry Inspection
Program, USDA, reviewed the extensive
objective and selective sampling program
his division is performing. Pesticides,
hormones, heavy metal, and antibiotic
residues are receiving concentrated atten-
tion in the sampling of red meat and
poultry. He described the cooperative
relationship between his department,
FDA and EPA.

Letter of Invitation for AVMA
Meeting from Dr. McCoy

I hope that by now you’re planning to join your
colleagues and their families for a few days of pro-
fessional renewal and fun during the 109th annual
AVMA convention in New Orleans, July 18—20.
Several format changes have been made, including
condensing the scientiﬁc sessions to three days to
maximize the beneﬁts that can be gained during
time away from practice.

Assisted by many allied groups, the program
committee has arranged more than 200 presentations
on a tremendous variety of topics ranging from hos-
pital management to aquatic veterinary medicine.
In addition, some 40 of our allied groups will hold
their own separate programs. An experimental fea- '
ture of our scientiﬁc meeting this year will be two Dr. J. R. McCoy,
limited-attendance “wet labs,” one on ophthalmology AVMA President
and another on anesthetic emergencies.

An all-day seminar program sponsored by the AVMA Foundation will provide
in-depth instruction on some 15 different topics. Participating veterinarians will
aid the profession as well as themselves, since any proﬁts from this activity go to
the Foundation. The exhibit of autotutorial programs ﬁrst displayed at the 1971
meeting has been expanded to include some 40 different self—education units this
year. Many of the programs demonstrated at Detroit have been used in state and
local association continuing education activities, and we hope these new ones
will be used even more widely.

But no convention is all work. Everyone is cordially invited to attend a special
inaugural luncheon Sunday, July 16. This meeting, which includes installation
of ofﬁcers and presentation of awards and gold honor roll membership cards, will
replace the plenary session traditionally held on Tuesday. Of course we’ll still
have our customary golf outing, president’s reception, alumni receptions, and
auxiliary functions, and this year’s family night affair will be a riverboat cruise.

Registration fees for youngsters have been eliminated this year, along with
AVMA-sponsored children’s programs. The local committee is arranging children’s
activities, however, and the many tours and special attractions available in New
Orleans offer each family a multitude of possibilities to plan entertainment tailored
to its own preferences. If you’ve been following the articles on New Orleans that
have appeared in each issue of J.A.V.M.A. since February 1, you know about
many of the ﬁne restaurants and sights this year’s convention city offers, and I’m
sure you are as anxious as Mrs. McCoy and I for the meeting to start. We’ll look
forward to greeting you there.

AVMA Annual Golf Outing

The AVMA golf outing for 1972 is to be held Monday, July 17,
at Lakewood Country Club in New Orleans. Lakewood is the site of
the Greater New Orleans Open on the PGA Tour and offers a
challenge to the ardent golfer.

Our plans are to have a shotgun start at 9:00 a.m. and it is hoped
all preregistrants will advise if they wish to play in a particular
foursome. Groups will be made up on Sunday night and will be on
the board at the entrance of the club Monday morning. Any late
entries will be ﬁlled in Monday morning.

We are fortunate to have Sports and Travel magazine to cover
our tournament with pictures. A complimentary picture of your
foursome will be given to each participant. Fort Dodge Laboratories
will also be on hand to present each participant with a gift which
will help all players who may lose golf balls in the many lakes
on Lakewood’s hazardous course.

After play the 19th hole should be an exceptional time for fellow—
ship and fun, for a buffet and drinks will be waiting for all par-
ticipants. Once again Sports and Travel will Sponsor our awards
program and trophies will be presented to low gross, 10w net, in
both men and ladies ﬂights. Be sure and hit your best on the
“longest drive hole” and the “closest to the hole,” for trophies will
be presented for both lady and men ﬂights. There will also be some
special awards for those golfers that make the exceptional shots!
You’ll hear more of this on the 19th hole.

We plan to make this the finest golf outing our members have
had. Hope to see all of you there.

May I, I972 |237

 




Point Credit for Reserve Officers

Army

Veterinarians holding Reserve commissions in the Army Veterinary
Corps who are not on active duty may receive credit for attending
certain sessions at the AVMA convention to be held in New Orleans,
La..., July 18—20, 1972, provided such attendance at any session is
for a period of not less than two hours and registration is accomplished
as noted below. Not more than one credit can be granted for any
single calendar day.

Military registration will not be accomplished at the general meet-
ing. Reserve ofﬁcers will certify their own registration and attendance
on DA Form 1380 through their appropriate headquarters.

 

Air Force Reserve Officers

Air Force Veterinary Reserve Ofﬁcers may receive point credit for
attending sessions of the AVMA convention in New Orleans, La.
Reserve officers may obtain necessary forms to complete and forward
to their military organizations for reserve training credit by requesting
them at the scheduled USAF Veterinary Service meeting. Wearing
of the uniform is optional.

 

AVMA Placement Service at

Annual Convention

Continuing the policy established at the annual meeting in
Dallas ﬁve years ago, the AVMA Placement Service will arrange
personal interviews between members of the Association seeking
employment and representatives of organizations wishing to em-
ploy veterinarians. The service is available without charge to
AVMA members in good standing who have registered with the
Placement Service and to exhibitors at the annual meeting, as
well as to potential employers registered with the Placement
Service.

Both candidates and employers, who have not previously done
so, are urged to register at the Placement Service ofﬁce imme-
diately upon arrival at The Rivergate in New Orleans. The
Placement Service ofﬁce will be located in the registration area.
Registration prior to July 1 is desirable. Requests for forms
should be sent to the Division of Scientiﬁc Activities, American
Veterinary Medical Association, 600 S. Michigan Ave., Chicago,
Ill. 60605.

All advance registrants, both veterinarians and employees,
should check in with the Placement Service ofﬁce immediately
upon arrival to establish a contact point for arrangement of
interviews.

While the Placement Service does not handle practice posi-
tions, a bulletin board will be available for posting information
regarding openings in clinical practices and résumés of veter-
inarians seeking practice positions.

The AVMA expects to continue its Placement Service and
will, as in the past, issue Bulletins of available veterinarians and
open positions three times yearly (January, May, and Septem-
ber). All inquiries should be directed to the Division of Scien-
tiﬁc Activities, AVMA.

Let’s Go To
New Orleans!

Winter is over—Spring is in the
air—So is the AVMA annual con-
vention to be held in New Orleans
July 18—20, 1972.

We hope that each and every
state ofﬁcer will be able to attend,
so make your plans now! Our ac-
tivities have been planned with
YOU in mind. Plenty of free time
has been allowed so that you can
see the sights and browse around ’ '
in the antique shops. Mrs. Mary Jane Paradee

MONDAY MORNING (notice
the change in day) the Delegates Registration Desk will be open
from 9:00 to 11:30 a.m. We are again going to have a Coffee
Hour for the delegates from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m. All of your
ofﬁcers will act as hostesses, and we will be on hand to help
answer your questions. The House of Delegates will start at
1:00 p.m. with the installation following immediately after. In
the evening there will be a President’s Reception for all to
attend.

Last year you asked for the “Market Place of States” to be
held earlier in the convention. This year we have arranged for
this, so bring all your goodies to sell on Tuesday. The Ladies
Get-Acquainted Breakfast will be from 8:00 to 10:30 a.m., with
the Market Place and craft activity center held from 9:30 a.m.
to 2:00 p.m.

The Ladies Continental Breakfast will be held from 8:30 to
9:30 a.m. on Wednesday morning. The “Speak Out” will be held
in the same room from 9:30 to 11:00 a.m. I hope that all of you
will come with some questions for this “brainstorming” session.
The “Speak Out” is to help YOU understand our programs and
projects more fully, and we have a SURPRISE for you, that you
will not want to miss. Unless you have a committee meeting
later, the rest of the day is FREE to do what you want.

We did not plan a speaker—we felt that there were so many
exciting things to do and see in New Orleans with your family,
that you would prefer this.

Time is drawing nigh, so do make your plans now to come
down, and we will see y’all there.

Surgical Correction of a Spinal

Fracture in a Dog

Steven F. Swaim, D.V.M., M.S.

SUMMARY

A fractured spine and posterior paralysis in a dog resulted from unknown
trauma. There had been a lapse of 1 week between the development of
paralysis and presentation for treatment, and there was marked displacement
of the spinal segments. Despite these poor prognostic factors, the dog had
good sensation in the pelvic limbs and was thus considered a favorable surgical
candidate. Surgical decompression of the spinal cord and internal spinal
ﬁxation with a vertebral body plate resulted in nearly complete neurologic

recovery.

SOME BASIC rules have been established
concerning indications for surgery in
cases of spinal fractures or luxations.
When there is incomplete paralysis, sur-
gical correction should be considered if
some voluntary muscle activity and tone
remain. Surgery should also be consid-
ered when there is some reﬂex ability
caudal to the lesion and when extensor
rigidity occurs only periodically or is
stimulated by handling. When such an
animal is seen promptly after the acci-
dent and radiographic examination re—
veals displacement of less than one-third
of the diameter of the spinal canal, the
injury may be surgically correctable.2
One of the most important factors in
deciding whether spinal surgery should
or should not be done is the time elapsed

since trauma. Spinal cord compression
that causes complete paralysis must be
of short duration if functional recovery
is to occur.“ Recovery from paralysis due
to sudden compression of the cord was
found to be possible only if the compres-
sion was relieved within 2 hours. With
sudden compression of the spinal cord of
10 minutes’ duration, it took 2 to 3 days
following relief of compression to obtain
initial neurologic improvement in dogs.
After 30 minutes of acute cord compres—
sion, initial neurologic improvement oc-
curred between 15 and 20 days following
relief of compression; improvement oc-
curred 20 to 30 days after relieving acute
cord compression of 50 to 120 minutes’
duration.5

If some spinal cord function remains
after acute compression, the compressive
force may persist for a longer period and
still be compatible with functional re-
covery. Dogs in which such compression

persisted for as long as 1 week had almost
full recovery after relief of the compres-
sion. Dogs whose spinal cords were de-
compressed as long as 3 weeks after
the onset of acute compression paralysis
had almost full recovery, provided some
spinal cord function persisted.5

The degree of spinal cord compression
and the dynamic force with which it
occurs are also factors that determine
whether neurologic function will return.
Minor compression that occurs quickly
and forcefully can cause more neurologic
damage than can a large lesion that has
developed slowly. Generally, the speed
of compression in spinal fractures and
luxations is instantaneous.2

Radiographic evaluation of the spinal
column may assist in determining the
feasibility of surgical correction. It must
be remembered, however, that radio-
graphs reﬂect only the ﬁnal position of
the spinal segments and not the dynamics
of the injury.1 At the time of radiographic
examination of a spinal luxation, the
spinal segments involved may be in nor-
mal alignment; however, at the time of
trauma there may have been gross dis-
placement of the segments and severe
damage to the spinal cord.

The evaluation of sensation in the

|3|6

pelvic limbs is an important factor in
prognosticating whether surgical correc-
tion is advisable following spinal trau-
ma.1—3 If the spinal damage is extensive,
leaving few normal neural elements in-
tact, the cerebral response to pain will
be absent when a toe of the pelvic limb
is pinched; however, when there is evi—
dence of sensation in the pelvic limbs
as well as a positive ﬂexor reﬂex, surgical
decompression and immobilization of the
spine is indicated?3

Case History

A 3-year-old female Foxhound was ad-
mitted to Auburn University Small Ani-
mal Clinic for treatment of posterior
paralysis that resulted from spinal trauma
of unknown origin. The paralysis had
developed approximately 1 week prior to
admission.

The dog was paraplegic but alert and
had an open draining wound over the
sacrococcygeal area. Hematologic exam-
ination revealed normal values. The dog
had a positive ﬂexor reﬂex in both pelvic
limbs when the digits were pinched with
hemostatic forceps; she had a bilateral
patellar reﬂex and there was evidence of
good sensation in both pelvic limbs. Ex-

tensor rigidity appeared in her forelimbs
only when she was handled and moved
about. When the dog was moved from
her cage onto a rolling cart for trans-
portation to radiographic facilities, a
distinct boney crepitation was felt over
the caudal thoracic spinal column.

Radiography revealed multiple frac-
tures of the pelvis and spinal column,
including a fracture of the cranial coc-
cygeal vertebrae with displacement of
the fractured segments, a sacroiliac lux-
ation, and some simple fractures of the
pelvis with minimal displacement. Of
major importance was a compression
fracture of Tlg—Tlg, with dorsal luxation
of T12 and left lateral displacement of
T13, causing a loss of continuity of the
neural canal. After the series of radio-
graphs was taken, another radiograph was
taken with the x-ray beam centered over
the Tm—Tlg area. The slight amount of
positioning of the dog that was done
resulted in a marked change in the align-
ment of the spinal segments (Fig. 1 and
2); in combination with the crepitation,
this indicated that the spinal column of
the dog was quite unstable.

Surgery and Treatment

In spite of the unfavorable radio-
graphic appearance of the spinal fracture

May I. I972

and the time lapse since trauma had
occurred, it was decided that the dog
was a suitable candidate for spinal de-
compression and ﬁxation. Preoperative
medication consisted of dexamethasone{1
and atropine sulfate.

The dog was prepared for spinal sur-
gery and positioned in sternal recum-
bency, with the left side slightly elevated.
A routine dorsal approach was made to
T12 and T13, exposing their left sides
from the tips of their dorsal spinous pro-
cesses to the costovertebral articulations.
A small intramedullary pin was used to
drill dorsoventral holes through the heads
of the 12th and 18th ribs just lateral to
their articulation with their respective
vertebrae. The ribs were then cut as
close to the vertebrae as possible and
allowed to retract ventrally.

The spinal cord was decompressed be-
tween T12 and T13 by means of hemi-
laminectomy. The spinal cord appeared
normal. Immobilization of the 2 vertebrae
was accomplished by affixing a 1%-inch
(4.5-cm.) bone plateb to the dorsolateral
aspects of the vertebral bodies. After
the spinal nerve was cut where it im-

merged from the intervertebral foramen,
a 4-hole bone plate was situated with 2
holes over each of the 2 vertebral bodies
involved. A‘ 5/64—inch (0.2-cm.) drill bit
was used to drill a hole lateral and
slightly ventral across the vertebral body
at the most caudal hole in the plate.
The depth of this hole was measured
with a bone depth gauge,C and a bone
screwd of the proper length was selected
and secured through the hole. The same
procedure was repeated through each of
the holes in the plate. The ﬁnal result
was a small bone plate afﬁxed to the
dorsolateral surface of the vertebral
bodies of T12 and T13 by means of 4
bone screws.4

After the vertebrae were immobilized,
the rib heads were elevated back into
position along the lateral aspect of the
vertebral bodies and were anchored in
place by means of wires passed through
the holes in the ribs and through the
dorsal spinous processes of the vertebrae
(Fig. 3). Closure of the incision was

done in a routine manner. Attempt was
not made to reduce or immobilize the
coccygeal or pelvic fractures. A body
bandage with a dorsal splint incorporated
in it was placed on the dog.

Postoperative treatment included dex—
amethasone for 5 days and penicillin-di-
hydrostreptomycine for 8 days. It was
necessary that the urinary bladder be
catheterized for the ﬁrst 3 days after
surgery, at the end of which the dog
began urinating voluntarily. The open
wound over the sacrococcygeal region
was ﬂushed daily with a nitrofuran Solu-
tionf for 16 days until it healed.

On the 3rd postoperative day the dog
began supporting weight on the pelvic
limbs. With limited daily exercise, her
neurologic status steadily improved until
she was dismissed from the hospital 18
days following surgery. At that time the
dog was able to walk unsupported, but
with slight ataxia.

Discussion

The fact that the dog’s spinal column
was extremely unstable was undoubtedly
beneﬁcial to her. Prior to surgery, she
would cry in pain when she tried to move
around, but would stop crying when she
found a comfortable position. Apparently,
she was able to move about until the
vertebral segments were in alignment and
pressure on the spinal cord was relieved.
As a result, there probably was no pro-
longed pressure on the spinal cord.

Poisoning and Congenital Malformations
Associated with Consumption of

Poison Hemlock by Sows

Larry D. Edmonds, M.S.P.H.; Lloyd A. Selby, D.V.M., Dr.P.H.;

Arthur A. Case, D.V.M., M.S.

SUMMARY

An epizootic of intoxications and congenital malformations occurred in a
southwestern Missouri swine herd in the late winter and spring of 1971.
The epizootic seemed to be associated with the observed consumption of
poison hemlock (Conium maculatum). Ten sows had signs of intoxication
in January; in March, 4 of the sows pregnant at the time of exposure far-
rowed 6 pigs with limb malformations and 34 pigs with signs of central

nervous system disturbance.

THE TOXIC properties of poison hemlock,
C. maculatum, were recognized by the
early Greeks. Hemlock poisoning was
implicated, based on the described symp-
toms, in Socrates’ death.6 Hemlock in-
toxication has also been reported in
domestic animals, speciﬁcally swine,1 cat-
tle,“ horses,8 and goats.2 Poison hemlock
is a member of the carrot family of plants
and grows on waste ground, ﬁelds, pas-
tures, fence rows, thickets, low ground,
and along roadsides and railroad tracks.7

This report is concerned with an epizo-
otic of intoxication and congenital mal—
formations in swine that occurred in
January and March, 1971, respectively.
The observed intoxications and the sub-
sequent malformations appeared to be

Materials and Methods

Background—Birth defects in pigs on
a farm in Jasper County, Missouri, were
reported to the Environmental Health
Surveillance Center in April, 1971. Epi-
demiologic ﬁeld investigations, conducted
in May and August, revealed that dairy
cattle had been raised on the farm for 16
years, and swine production on this farm
began in October, 1969. The breeding
stock included 62 Yorkshire-Hampshire-
Chester White crossbred sows and 2 pure-
bred Yorkshire boars. The sows had far-
rowed 2 litters prior to this 3rd litter in
which intoxication and birth defects were
observed. The sows had been brought to
the farm as young gilts. Malformations
or illness were not observed during the
ﬁrst 2 fa‘rrowing cycles. The number'of
females that farrowed and number of
pigs born before and after the epizootic
are presented (Table 1).

served (Jan. 18 through March 30, 1971),
pasture 1 (Fig. 1) was implicated in the
epizootic. The 62 crossbred sows were
allotted tO 3 groups: group A (bred
prior to being placed in pasture 1), group
B (not bred prior tO being placed in pas-
ture 1), and group C (never exposed to
pasture 1). There were 24, 20, and 18
sows in groups A, B, and C, respectively.
From October, 1969, until the intoxica-
tions occurred in 1971, all groups were
conﬁned tO drylot 1 at night. During the
daytime they were on a pasture predom-
inantly Of tall fescue but with some na-
tive grasses (pasture 2). Prior to far-
rowing, the sows in group C were conﬁned
in individual farrowing houses in drylot 2.

On Jan. 18, 1971, the sows in groups
A and B were placed in pasture 1. This
pasture had not been used previously as a
pasture for swine. It had, however, been
used as a pasture for dairy cattle for
several years and apparent intoxication
or malformations had not been observed
in this species. In addition, a horse had

months without intoxication.

On January 21, a pregnant sow from
group A was discovered dead in pasture
1. A local veterinarian tentatively diag-
nosed cardiac arrest as the cause of
death in this sow.

Two days later, on January 23, an
additional 5 sows from group A were
Observed by the producer to have the
following signs: “These sows walked with
a staggering gait, some fell down on their
haunches, laid Over on their side and
trembled as with a chill; then their eyes
rolled back in their head and beads of
sweat appeared on their bodies.” Even-
tually the legs drew up tO the body and
they lapsed into a coma for 2 tO 3 days.
Of these 5 sows 2 died and 3 recovered
and farrowed in March, 1971.

Following this episode, the remaining
pregnant sows in group A were removed
from the pasture and conﬁned tO drylot
1. At this time it was suspected that

stated that sows that developed signs of
intoxication were those that were bigger
or were greedy eaters; thus it was as-
sumed they consumed a large quantity
of C. maculatum.

The sows in group B had not been bred
and were allowed to remain in pasture 1
for another 2 weeks, at which time 4 sows
were found dead with contracted legs.
All sows were subsequently conﬁned to
drylot 1.

Further problems were not observed
in the sows in groups A and B until those

in group A began to farrow in March,
1971. Of the 21 surviving sows that far-
rowed between March 15 and March 30,
4 delivered malformed pigs in addition
to pigs with an apparent nervous system
disturbance. Two of these sows were in
the group that had been intoxicated
previously. Six of 55 pigs farrowed by
the 4 sows were born with malformations
of the hindlimbs, and 1 malformed pig
had syndactyly. The pigs with leg mal-
formations died within 2 to 4 days. An
additional 34 pigs were observed to have
classic signs of hemlock poisoning at
birth. These signs included trembling
and ataxia, especially of the lower limbs.
Of those pigs with a nervous system in-
volvement, 17 (50%) died within a week.
The survivors were found to have necrosis
of the edges of the ears and end of the
tail. The necrotic tissue sloughed within
a few weeks.

According to results of our surveillance
of birth defects in Missouri,9 the rate of
birth defects noted in this epizootic is
more than 3 times the expected rate (6.4 /
1,000 births) of congenital malforma-
tions.12 In this epizootic the congenital
malformation rate for the sows pregnant
and exposed to hemlock (group A) was
21.2/1,000. The rate for group C (preg-
nant and not exposed to hemlock) was
0/ 1,000 total births.

Postepizootic.—Following the epizootic
of intoxications and deaths (J an., 1971)
and the subsequent farrowings (March,
1971) with malformations, further intoxi-
cation or malformations were not ob-
served in the herd. The sows in group B,
some of which had been intoxicated prior
to being bred, farrowed in June (Table
1). The sows in group C, which were
not exposed to pasture 1 and had no
malformed offspring, farrowed their 4th
litter in August. The sows in group A
were expected to farrow in September,
1971; however, they were sold by the
producer prior to farrowing.

Animal Husbandry.—Animal hus-
bandry practices conducted on the farm
from the preepizootic through the post-
epizootic periods were similar, except for
the use of pasture 1. Water source for
the pigs was a 57 -ft. (17 -M.) drilled well
from which water was pumped to troughs

I322

fed and gestation periods of the 3 groups of

in drylots 1 and 2. This water was also
the water source for the dairy herd and
the producer’s family.

The sows’ diet consisted of a commer-
cially prepared complete sow ration, 3 lb.
(1.4 kg.) /sow/ day, alfalfa hay, 3 to 4 lb.
(1.4 to 1.8 kg.)/sow/day, and a mineral
mix‘ll fed free choice. The relationship
between these rations and the gestation
cycles of the sows in the herd is given
(Fig. 2). The brands of feed were changed
in the month of October from brand X
to brand Y, and the protein content of
brand Y was increased from 14% to
18% during the month of October.

Prior to breeding, all sows were vac-
cinated for erysipelas and leptospirosis.
In addition, they were given a piperazine
preparationb at breeding. Other drugs
were not administered to the sows during
the gestation cycle. At farrowing, how-
ever, each sow was given 2 m1. of oxy-
tocinc after the ﬁrst pig was born. The
bedding of the sows was dusted once a
week until 2 weeks prior to farrowing
with a powderd containing 1% lindane
and 10% sulfur.

the Hampshire-Yorkshire-Chester White
crossbred sows were not related to the

had not been used for breeding purposes.
It was estimated that the inbreeding co-
efﬁcient was approximately zero.

Pathologic Findings

One of the pigs with limb defects was
saved by the producer for laboratory
studies (Fig. 3).

Each hindlimb was

shire-Hampshire-Chester White crossbred pig.

fully extended at the stiﬂe. Distal to the
hock, each limb was directed slightly
laterally. The amount of lateral devia-
tion at this point was approximately 20
degrees. Distal to the hock, each hind-
limb was rotated so that the plantar
surface of each digit faced the midline.
The right testicle was descended to an
abnormal position 2 cm. caudal to the
prepuce between the external abdominal
oblique muscle and the skin. There were
decubitus ulcers on the lateral surface
of each forelimb, suggesting contact with
an abrasive surface.

Discussion

The geographic distribution of the poi-
son hemlock, location of the affected
sows, and clinical signs observed suggest
an association between the intoxication
and malformations and the consumption
of C. maculatum (Fig. 4). Poison hem-
lock is a common plant throughout the
United States and southern Canada. All

parts of the poison hemlock plant are
toxic if eaten. The stem, leaves, and
fruit, in descending order, contain the
highest concentration of alkaloids, and
the root contains the least amount.13

Conium maculatum contains at least 5
distinct, closely related alkaloids, which
are coniine, N-methyl coniine, conhy-
drine, lambdaconiceine, and pseudocon-
hydrine.6 Coniine is a colorless, volatile,
strongly alkaline oil similar to nicotine in
its structure and action.3 Like nicotine it
causes transitory stimulation followed by
severe depression of the central nervous
system, resulting in paralysis, coma, and
bradycardia. Death occurs when the
phrenic nerve is affected and the respi-
ratory muscles become paralyzed.

The signs described in this epizootic
were analogous to those reported in hu-
man beings6 and domestic animalsﬁm’11
A case of poison hemlock intoxication
was reported in which an 8-month-old
gilt exhibited signs similar to those re-
ported here.1 These signs included ner-
vousness, trembling, ataxia, especially of
the lower limbs, dilation of the pupils,
weakened and slowed heart beat, coldness
of extremities and the entire body, coma,
and eventual death. The signs are also
similar to those reported in which con-
sumption of tobacco stalks containing

nicotine alkaloid was implicated as the
intoxicant.10 An episode of skeletal mal-
formations was observed in a Utah cattle
herd. It was speculated that C. macu-
latum was related to the malformations.4

The sows that farrowed pigs with limb
malformations were in the 43rd to 61st
day of gestation when placed on pasture
1. At that time the limbs would have
been well developed, as limb buds begin
developing on the 17th to 18th day of
gestation.5 The malformed limbs in this
epizootic did not have bone deﬁciencies
but, rather, involvement of soft tissue
structures that develop later. This sug-
gests that the insult to the limbs oc-
curred late in the embryologic devel-
opment of the limbs. The only other
malformation observed in the necropsied
pig was cryptorchidism. The testes begin
to descend on the 62nd day of gestation;
the day of exposure to C. maculatum in
the necropsied pig was between the 57th
and 59th days (based on a breeding date
of Nov. 23, 1970).

Several environmental factors were
considered as causes of intoxication in
the sows and congenital malformations
in the pigs. At the time of the epizootic
the only green vegetation available to
the sows was young C. maculatum. The
sows in group C served as “controls”
inasmuch as they were not exposed to
the pasture. They were subjected to the
same animal husbandry practices, feed,
and water, yet they did not experience
any intoxication or malformations.

Feed for the 3 groups was identical
until October, 1970. In October and No-
vember, 1970, the producer changed com-
mercial brands and the percentage of
protein of the sow supplements used
(Fig. 2). In effect, the supplement was
changed 3 times for the pregnant sows
in group C. Also some of the sows in
group A experienced a single change in
their protein supplement when they were
less than 10 days pregnant. The protein
supplement was not changed for group
B sows while they were pregnant. Only
sows in group C were in the late middle
or last 3rd of pregnancy, when it is be-
lieved the defects occurred, for reasons

I 324

given earlier. The fact that the sows in
group C did not farrow defective pigs
suggests that the supplement change was
not associated with the epizootic.

Our retrospective investigations sup-
port the hypothesis that poison hemlock
(C. maculatum) was associated with the
epizootic of intoxication of sows and the
congenital malformations and central
nervous system disturbance in newborn
pigs. Further laboratory experiments,
however, need to be performed to repro-
duce the congenital malformations and
nervous system disturbance in newborn

pigs.

Ketamine Anesthesia in Swine

J. C. Thurman, D.V.M., M.S.; D. R. Nelson, D.V.M., M.S.;

G. J. Christie, M.R.C.V.S.

SUMMARY

Ketamine was evaluated as an anesthetic and immobilizing agent in swine.
In the dosage used, analgesia was adequate for surgical procedures of only a
minor nature and of short duration. After intramuscular injection, rapid
immobilization occurred. This facilitated injection of sodium thiopental or
the administration of halothane, using a face mask, when mOre prolonged

surgical anesthesia was indicated.

Electroejaculation was accomplished easily in boars immobilized with

ketamine alone.

Excitement during the recovery period often was pronounced. It was
more severe in older animals and those handled roughly during the induction
and recovery period. Excitement was controlled easily with sodium thiopental

injection.

“DISSOCIATIVE anesthesia” is a term given
to the cataleptic-like state produced in a
subject by injection of ketamine HCl2’3’6’a
(2-(O-chlorophenyl)-2-(methylamino)
cyclohexanone hydrochloride), a short-
acting nonbarbiturate anesthetic.9 In
most species, catalepsy is accompanied
by a high degree of analgesia. In some
species, however, analgesia is not pro-
found and a supplemental anesthetic
agent is necessary if surgical procedures
are to be performed.

When ketamine is given either intra-
muscularly or intravenously, immobiliza-
tion and anesthesia develop rapidly. It
does not depress respiration as much as
barbiturates do. In species such as the
rat, dog, and man, the cardiovascular
system is stimulated, with a resulting
increase in blood pressure and pulse rate.1

Ketamine does not depress laryngeal
and pharyngeal reﬂexes. Tone of intra-
oral muscles and the tongue is main-
tained, thereby ensuring a patent airway.4
If tracheal intubation is to be carried
out in animals given ketamine, a topical
anesthetic should be applied to laryngeal
structures to prevent laryngeal spasm
when the endotracheal catheter is in-
serted.

Administration of injectable anesthet—
ics in swine is difficult because peripheral
blood vessels are not readily accessible.
Further, large swine frequently are diffi-
cult to restrain for intravenous injection.
Therefore, immobilizing or anesthetic
agents that produce their effect after
intramuscular injection are desirable for
use in this species. Ketamine is such an
agent; it may be administered safely by
either intravenous or intramuscular routes.

Materials and Methods

The immobilizing and anesthetic effect
of ketamine was evaluated separately and in
various combinations with sodium thiopen—
tal, halothane, lidocaine, and atropine sul-

fate under clinical conditions. Ketamine
was used in concentrations of 50 mg./ml.
and 100 mg./ml.

Male and female swine of various breeds,
ranging in age from 3 weeks to 30 months
and weighing 4.9 to 242 kg. were used. Forty
trials were conducted in 21 animals.

Prior to administration of ketamine, each
animal was weighed and given a physical
examination, and temperature, pulse, and
respiratory rates were recorded. Food was
withheld for 12 hours and water for 6 hours
prior to each trial.

The animals were allotted to 2 groups.
Those in 1 group were subjected to a variety
of surgical procedures (Table 1), and those
in the other group were subjected to semen
collection by means of electroejaculation
(Table 2).

After intramuscular administration of ke-
tamine, each animal was observed and the
time interval was recorded when signs of
incoordination and immobilization occurred.
The time at which maximal depth of anes—
thesia occurred was judged by minimal
response to pinprick, stable respiration, and
maximal relaxation.

Surgical procedures or manipulations were
not attempted for at least 10 minutes after

TABLE l—Anesthetic Regimen and Surgical Procedures in l7 Swine

immobilization. The times at which each
animal was able to stand unassisted and was
fully recovered were recorded. Full recovery
time was considered to be when the animal
walked, ate, and drank in a normal manner.

The pulse rate, respiratory rate, and rectal
temperature were recorded at 10-minute
intervals throughout the trials.

Surgical Procedures—Nineteen trials were
conducted in 17 animals (Table 1). Ke-
tamine was administered intramuscularly at
a dosage of 20.2:092 mg./kg. of body
weight (9.2 i 0.42 mg./ 1b.). Ketamine was
used as the sole anesthetic agent for four
10- to 20—minute surgical procedures. It was
supplemented with local inﬁltration of the
surgical site with 2% lidocaine in 5 pro-
cedures. Sodium thiopental was adminis-
tered intravenously at a dosage of 6.6 and
11 mg./kg. of body weight (3 and 5 mg./lb.)
as a supplement in 2 procedures. A com—
bination of ketamine and sodium thiopental
followed by 2% halothane in oxygen (2 L./
min.) administered via an endotracheal
catheter was used for extended surgical
procedures in 3 animals. Ketamine supple—
mented by 2% halothane in oxygen (4 L./
min.) administered via a face mask was
used in 5 surgical procedures.

assumed either a lateral or sternal posi-
tion in 2.2 i 0.60 minutes. Maximal
depth of anesthesia, as judged by clinical
signs, developed in 8.2 i- 0.38 minutes
(Fig. 1).

Marked salivation was observed in all
animals not given atropine sulfate prior
to administration of ketamine. Because
analgesia produced by ketamine at the
dosage used was not adequate for major
surgical procedures, ketamine was sup-
plemented with sodium thiopental, 2%
halothane in oxygen, or 2% lidocaine
inﬁltration of the surgical site.

Tracheal intubation for administration
of halothane could be accomplished only
after the laryngeal mucosa was sprayed
With 2% lidocaine or after the intrave-
nous injection of sodium thiopental. In
most cases, incomplete relaxation of the
jaw muscles made visual observation of
the larynx diﬂicult. This problem was not
encountered when halothane was admin-
istered by a face mask.

thetic period. An increased respiratory
rate occasionally developed during the
recovery period in larger animals that
were not given sodium thiopental as a
supplemental agent.

Animals given ketamine only, ketamine
and atropine, or ketamine along with
lidocaine inﬁltration of the surgical site
were able to stand unassisted in 93.6 i:
9.08 minutes. Full recovery was achieved
in 142.8 1: 9.90 minutes (Fig. 2). Stand-
ing and full recovery times were not cal-
culated for animals in the surgical group
given sodium thiopental or halothane,
inasmuch as these agents were used to
prolong surgical anesthesia.

Excitement during the recovery period
occurred occasionally. It was of greatest
signiﬁcance in the older and larger ani-
mals. Further, it occurred more fre-
quently in those animals not given
sodium thiopental or halothane as a
supplemental agent.

All swine survived the surgical trials.

Semen Collection Trials—After intra-
muscular injection of ketamine to boars,
signs of incoordination developed in 1.6 i
0.48 minutes. The boars were down in
either sternal or lateral recumbency in
2.6 :1: 0.51 minutes. The maximal depth
of anesthesia developed in 8.07 i 0.40
minutes (Fig. 1).

Marked salivation occurred in all boars.
In 12 trials, salivation was controlled
effectively by atropine sulfate adminis-
tered at the termination of the semen
collection procedure.

Fasciculation of the lip muscles was
commonly noticed at the time of im-
mobilization. The boars also tended to
lick their lips; they sneezed occasionally.
Clinically, they appeared to be ventilated
adequately, although the respiratory rate
increased. After maximal depth of anes-
thesia was attained, the respiratory pat-
tern of most boars changed. Short, jerky
respirations were intermixed with the
normal pattern. Administration of sodium
thiopental after the semen was collected
reinstated the normal pattern.

In all trials, boars were immobilized
sufﬁciently to allow semen collection by
means of electroejaculation. An adequate

semen sample was obtained in all trials
except one. Duration of the semen col-
lection procedure ranged from 10 to 30
minutes. In most trials, 10 to 20 minutes
was adequate for sample collection.

Recovery from ketamine anesthesia
was accompanied frequently by some
degree of excitement. Excitement was
more marked in those boars that were
handled roughly during the induction
period or in those subjected to long pe-
riods of vigorous stimulation with the
electroejaculator. Signs of excitement
that could be interpreted as hallucina-
tions were controlled effectively by the
intramuscular injection of sodium thio-
pental. (Hallucinations are frequent oc-
currences in adult human beings given
ketamineF) In those boars given sodium
thiopental at the termination of the
semen collection procedure, excitement
was not observed during the recovery
period. Boars given only ketamine were
able to stand unassisted in 104.6 : 5.6
minutes. They were able to walk, eat,
and drink in 153.8 3: 4.2 minutes (Fig.
2). Boa‘rs given sodium thiopental as a
supplemental agent at termination of the
semen collection procedure were able to
stand unassisted in 132.5 1- 16.6 minutes
and were able to walk and consume food
and water in 184.2 : 17.14 minutes (Fig.
2).

Two boars died after getting to- their
feet during the recovery period. Because
these animals resisted containment, the
measures of restraint necessary to permit
administration of ketamine evoked an
extreme apprehensive state in both ani-
mals. In 1 of these 2 boars, a satisfactory
semen sample could not be obtained, thus
resulting in long and vigorous stimulation
with the electroejaculator. Necropsy sub-
sequently revealed extensive abscessation
of both testicles. Attempts were not
made to control the excitement phase
with sodium thiopental in either of these
2 boars.

Discussion

Intramuscular injection of ketamine
frequently caused signs of pain at the
site of injection that did not appear to
be directly related to drug concentration.

May I. I972

A similar response has been reported in
the dog.8

Even though salivation was excessive
when the animals became recumbent, it
could be controlled with atropine sulfate.
A patent airway was maintained easily
by placing a sandbag underneath the
animal’s neck in order to tilt the head
downward. This permitted saliva to ﬂow
out of the mouth, thus preventing its
aspiration. ‘

When ketamine was used as an in-
duction agent preceding inhalation anes-
thesia, tracheal intubation frequently was
difficult because jaw muscles were not
relaxed sufﬁciently to permit visual in—
spection of the laryngeal opening. Even
when the laryngeal opening could be
viewed, spasms occurred when we at-
tempted to insert the endotracheal cath-
eter. Lidocaine (2%), when sprayed on
the laryngeal mucosa, prevented spasms.
All animals appeared to maintain ade—
quate respiratory minute tidal volume.
Thus, by placing a mask over each ani-
mal’s snout and administering 3 to 4%
halothane in oxygen, we were able to
effect relaxation of the jaw muscles with
the onset of surgical anesthesia. At this
time, the laryngeal opening was Viewed
easily with the aid of a laryngoscope.

Convulsions such as those reported in
dogs given ketamine8 did not occur; how-
ever, excitement during the recovery
period was a frequent occurrence in ani-
mals that were not given sodium thio-
pental or halothane as supplemental
agents. A recent study in dogs has re-
vealed that ketamine is a central nervous
system stimulant because of its action
in increasing cerebral blood ﬂow and
oxygen consumption. The stimulating
effect was found to be reversible on ad-
ministration of sodium thiopental, how-
ever.“ It has been suggested that diaze—
pam can be used effectively to depress
the psycholeptic actions of ketamine.7

The 2 boars that died after getting to
their feet continually walked around the
stall until they became overheated. In
both trials the boars were handled
roughly during the induction period and
were subjected to vigorous stimulation
with the electroejaculator. The clinical

I329

 

 




signs shortly before death resembled
those associated with the “porcine stress
syndrome”10 (dyspnea, followed by open-
mouth breathing, elevated body temper-
ature, alternating areas of blanching
and erythema of the skin, and rigor
mortis occurring almost immediately
upon death). We have witnessed similar
changes in swine subjected to halothane
anesthesia. Attempts were not made to
control the excitement stage in these 2
boars because we were interested in the
ﬁnal outcome of the excitement syn-
drome.

In swine, ketamine appears to offer
its greatest advantage as an immobilizing
agent. If swine are excited during the
induction or recovery period or are sub-
jected to vigorous stimulation with an
electroejaculator, sodium thiopental or
some other psycholytic agent should be
given to effect a smooth recovery.

Lancet, 1,

Foot lesions were induced experimentally in pigs weighing
up to 200 lb. (90.8 kg.) by housing them on a rough concrete

surface.

There was a highly signiﬁcant difference in the

 

 

incidence of moderate and severe lesions in pigs housed on
a rough surface compared with a smooth one (P < 0.001).
Bruising of the heel or the heel/ sole junction was a common
ﬁnding and this frequently preceded the development of
erosive lesions.

Dirty conditions underfoot did not signiﬁcantly increase
the incidence of lesions. The twice-weekly use of a foot bath
containing a 10% copper sulfate solution or a 10% formalin
solution used less frequently delayed the onset of lesions
but did not prevent their development. Growth rate and
feed efficiency were not signiﬁcantly affected by the deveIOp—
ment of foot lesions—A. 1. Wright et al. in Vet. Rec., 90,

Veterinary Histology: An Outline Text-Atlas

This book represents the ﬁrst successful attempt in English to bring
together information on the comparative histology of our domestic animals.
It is organized into 3 major subject areas: Cytology, Basic Tissues (His-
tology), and Organology. The approach is that of an expanded atlas with
brief explanations of the many photomicrographs. When information con-
cerning certain structures in the body is not readily available, the ex-
planations are fairly complete.

The section on the comparative histology of digestive systems of domestic
animals is particularly helpful since there are so many variations in these
animals. The author has done an excellent job in bringing out these im-
portant differences with brief but detailed descriptions. The section on the
histology of claws and the hoof is likewise well done."

The book is well illustrated with electron-photomicrographs, black and
white pictures, and line drawings. The black and white photomicrographs
appear to lack some sharpness and many of the structures they show are
not speciﬁcally labeled. This, in many instances, would make their in-
terpretation for the beginning student a little difﬁcult.

All in all, the book is a valuable edition for the veterinary histologist and
for those investigators interested in factual comparisons of tissues of domes-
tic animals.——[Veterinary Histology: An Outline Text-Atlas. By Horst—

were coughing and weight loss. Inset is an enlarged section.

History.———A female dog of mixed breeding, about 3 years old, was ex-
amined because of coughing and weight loss during the previous 2 weeks.
Temperature was 104 F. (40.0 C.). Blood test results were hemoglobin,
20 mg./ 100 m1.; packed cell volume, 51%; white blood cell count, 20,000/
cmm.; nonsegmented cells, 39%; segmented cells, 45%; lymphocytes, 16%;
and blood urea nitrogen, 90 mg. / 100 ml.

Here Is the Diagnosis
(Continued from preceding page)

Radiologic Diagnosis—Pulmonary mycosis.

Comment—The pneumonic lesions were suspected of having a mycotic
origin, suggesting histoplasmosis, because of the diffuse pattern. The dog
died before the test for histoplasmosis could be administered. The histologic
diagnosis was blastomycosis. .

Infectious Canine Hepatitis and Chronic Renal Failure

Blood and urine samples were collected from dogs ad-
mitted to the Beaumont Animals’ Hospital, Royal Veterinary
College. Chronic renal failure (CRF) was diagnosed on the
basis of clinical signs of polyuria, polydipsia, inappetence and
apathy, plus a fasting blood urea content in excess of 40 mg. /
100 m1. and more than 30 mg. protein/ 100 ml. in urine of
low speciﬁc gravity. The ﬁrst 20 dogs to satisfy all these
criteria were selected, and the ﬁrst 20 to have none of these
clinical or clinicopathologic signs were placed in a 2nd, so-
called “normal” group, i.e., those unlikely to be suffering from
renal disease.

Serum samples were titrated for leptospiral agglutinins
and infectious canine hepatitis neutralizing antibodies. In-
fectious canine hepatitis antibody titers of 1:1,280 or more
are considered to be indicative of recent or active infection.
Applying a chi-square test, it was found that the number of
dogs in the CRF group with such titers, compared with the
number in the normal group, was signiﬁcantly greater (P <
0.01). Leptospiral agglutinin titers of 1:100 or greater are
usually taken as evidence of infection. Using this criterion
in respect to Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae and L. canicola
titers, there was no signiﬁcant difference between the 2
groups (P > 0.1).——B. M. Bush in Vet. Rec., 90, (Jan. 8,

Look for the veterinary “V” on the green label

INDICATIONS: Surital may be used as the sole intravenous anes-
thetic agent for major and minor surgery, or for intubation and
induction of anesthesia prior to the administration of a volatile
anesthetic in dogs, cats, horses, swine, and cattle. WARNING: Emer-
gence delirium in horses and emergence excitement in dogs may
occur following barbiturate anesthesia. lntra-arterial injections may
result in direct cerebrovascular endothelial injury and consequent
edema and ischemic necrosis in the brain, especially in the horse. PRE-
CAUTIONS: The preparation of patients for Surital anesthesia should be the
same as for any other general anesthetic. There is no contraindication to
the use of Surital if general anesthesia itself is not contraindicated. As
with any anesthetic, if at any time cyanosis occurs or if respiration be-
comes excessively depressed, injection of the drug should be stopped
and, if necessary, artificial respiration instituted. Surital, like other
thiobarbiturates, should not be given to patients with severe hepatic
disease. The progress of anesthesia must be followed carefully
throughout the period of anesthetization. A free airway should be
maintained at all times. In order to gain control of the animal, the
first portion of the dose may be injected rather rapidly, with the
remainder given slowly until the desired effect is achieved. As
a precautionary measure in small animals, the stomach should
be empty. Perivascular injection may result in severe irritation
of the surrounding tissue. Additional care should be employed
when anesthetizing anemic or hypovolemic animals and
animals with cardiac or respiratory problems. Liver pathol-
ogy may delay detoxification. Elevated urea nitrogen or
electrolyte imbalances may prolong anesthesia. Prolonged
recovery may occur in hypothermia or in malnourished
animals and following continuous use for a prolonged
surgical procedure. HOW SUPPLIED: Surital Veterinary

EQUIGARD® (Dichlorvos) Equine
Anthelmintic — thorough, proven.

Naturally reared horses probably have stom-
ach bots and gastro-intestinal nematodes in
one life cycle stage or another at all times. N 0
known anthelmintic is effective against all
stages. In order to obtain optimum control
administer Equigard® every 4'to 6 weeks. Try
it and observe the results.

INDICATIONS

For the removal and control of bots (Gastrophilus
intestinalis, G. nasalis), large strongyles (S trongylus
vulgaris, S. equinus, S. edentatus), small strongyles
(of the genera Cyathostomum, Cylicocercus, Cylico-
cyclus, Cylicodontophorus, Triodontophorus, Poteri-
ostomum, Gyalocephalus), pinworms (Oxyuris equi).
EQUIGUARD (dichlorvos) has been demonstrated
to be active against the ascarid (Parascaris equorum)
in those animals consuming suﬂicient grain to ingest
the therapeutic dosage.

CONTRAINDICATIONS
Horses severely debilitated or suffering from diarrhea
or severe constipation, infectious disease, toxemia or
colic should not be treated until such conditions are

Reprinted from Modern Veterinary Practice
52(3):?8-81, 1971

corrected with proper therapy. Do not administer in
conjunction with or within one (1) week of adminis-
tration of muscle relaxant drugs (i.e. succinylcholine),
phenothiazine derived tranquilizers, or central ner-
vous system depressant drugs. Horses should not be
subjected to insecticide treatment for ﬁve (5) days
prior to or after EQUIGARD (dichlorvos) treatment.
Do not administer to horses aﬂiicted with Chronic
Alveolar Emphysema (Heaves) or related respiratory
conditions. There are no other known contraindications
for this preparation.

EQUIGARD® Equine Anthelmintic consists of di-

chlorvos (2,2-dichloroviny1 dimethyl phosphate) in an
inert base.

Are you" ‘
palatabil
small ani

You won’t with Clinicarel”

There are three reasons for Clinicare’s
pronounced superiority in the area of palatability.

They are whole eggs, beef, and cold-pack
processing.

Clinicare has far more whole egg than any
other available small animal diet. Beef instead
of horse meat.

And Clinicare is packed cold, then cooked
once and only once, in the can.

You can see the difference when you look at
Clinicare. And then, taking into account
Clinicare’s higher levels of vitamin
supplementation, its advantages are clear.
There are five specially designed Clinicare
diets. Consider them.

CLINICARE E (High Protein/Low Residue Diet)
Reduces physical irritation and provides extra vitamins
and minerals. For enteric conditions, also pre and
post-surgery cases.

CLINICABE N (Nephritic/Geriatric) Has balanced
amino acid profile to reduce protein waste and kidney
work load in patients with renal impairment. An excel-
lent basal diet.

?

CLINICARE 0 (Low Calorie Diet) Just 340 calories
per pound, with a maximum of one percent fat, added
vitamins and minerals essential for dieting.

CLINICARE G (Growth/Reproduction Diet)
About 621 calories per pound. Specially designed for
lactating or pregnant bitches and growing pups. Con-
tains the additional minerals they need for milk produc-
tion and faster bone development.

CLINICARE F (Feline Formula) Complete protein,
vitamin and mineral diet for cats, with high fat and low
ash content.

Dr. Link Issues Inaugural
Statement to House of
. Delegates

In' his inaugural statement to the
House of Delegates, Sunday, July 16,
AVMA President-Elect Roger P. Link
(ISU ’34), urged the profession to move
quickly to relieve the shortage of veteri~
narians and to produce veterinarians with
specialized training in research, public
health services, environmental toxicology,
and diseases of aquatic animals.

At the opening session of the House,
the incoming president also stressed the
importance of making continuing educa-
tion opportunities available to all veteri-
narians. He commended state veterinary
associations that have established acade-
mies of veterinary medicine for this pur-
pose and complimented speciality groups
for establishing standards for member-
ship. ”The AVMA must be in a position
to help those in need,” he said.

The lack of minimal standards for the
30 schools now training animal health
technicians—most of whom will be em-
ployed by veterinarians—was another
concern of Dr. Link’s. ”Minimal stan-
dards should be established to insure a
degree of competence in these gradu-
ates,” he stated and expressed confidence
that the House of Delegates, representing
the Association’s 23,196 members, would
approve a resolution before the meeting,
giving AVMA permission to accredit the
animal health technicians schools.

In considering the shortage of veteri-
narians, the incoming president, who is
professor and head of the Department of
Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology
at the University of Illinois College of
Veterinary Medicine, told delegates that
at the present time veterinary schools are
flooded with applicants, but there does
not appear to be a proven set of criteria
on which to make a selection of students.
”How can the schools identify, before ad-
mission, those who really want to be vet-
erinarians ?” he asked. ”Is there a way
to predict motivation ?”

Stating that clinical instruction is usual-
ly the major factor limiting enrollment
in veterinary schools, he questioned,
”Should schools be established to provide
only the last 2 years of instruction?
Many of the existing schools have equip-
ment and facilities to offer instruction
for the first 2 years to a larger number
of students than they are enrolling, but
would require more staff and a larger
budget.” He asked the delegates to con-
sider whether this would be a logical way
to proceed in relieving the veterinary
shortage, and, if so, whether the AVMA
should suggest this approach to help pro-
vide the needed graduates.

INAUGURAL STATEMENT—
(Continued from page 4)

Other areas offering the profession a
great challenge, Dr. Link suggested, are:

Pit/)lic health work. ”This is an area
of activity in which our profession can
make a major contribution to the general
health of. our society,” he observed. That
the capabilities of veterinarians in this
field are gaining recognition is shown by
a recent statement of Dr. Franklin Yoder,
director of the Illinois Department of
Public Health: ”Veterinarians are as well
qualified as physicians to perform all
duties of a public health official except
those which require contact with human
patients."

Reieai'r/y in Certain a’irciplinei. Veteri-
narians with specialized training are bet-
ter prepared than any other group of
scientists to perform research in certain
disciplines, such as experimental surgery,
immunology, pharmacology, and toxicol-
ogy, said Dr. Link, because all require
animal experimentation. However, be-
cause the supply of veterinarians with

such specialized training is limited, the
profession has been unable to fulfill its
real potential in biomedical research.

Environmental toxicology. Dr. Link
said that to properly determine the signif-
icance of the hazards to people and ani-
mals when chemical agents are used for
purposes for which they are recommend—
ed will require animal experimentation.
”In my judgment,” he said, ”veterinari-
ans, especially those with specialized
training, are the best qualified scientists
to conduct this work.” He warned that
the profession may lose its proper place
in this important area because of lack of
personnel. .

Disease problems of aquatic animals".
The need for veterinarians with special
knowledge in aquatic disease problems is
emphasized by the increasing percentage
of human food that must be obtained
from the sea as the production of food
of animal origin becomes limited on
land. ”Our profession must move quick-
ly before some other group takes our
place in this specialty area,” noted Dr.
Link.

Pet animal population. ”I urge veteri-
narians to cooperate with responsible
agencies in an effort to slow the increase
in pet animal population,” said the in-
coming AVMA president about this
widespread problem.

In conclusion, Dr. Link challenged
AVMA members with the recent com-
ment of a journalist well acquainted with
the veterinary profession and its contri-
butions to society. ”Your profession,” he
said to Dr. Link, ”has hidden its contri-
butions under a basket; it is time to let
people know what you do.”

What To Eat
And Where

Creole cuisine is unique unto New
Orleans. Why? Primarily because the
ingredients essential to the distinctive fla-
vor of Creole cooking are not available
elsewhere, except at great cost. So, when
you visit the French Quarter, try some
Creole food. A few of the many restau-
rants are:

Dining in the French Quarter

Galatoire’s Restaurant, 209 Bourbon St.
(no reservations accepted). Considered
to serve the best food in New Orleans,
one must overlook any shortcomings (the
rather bleak single room, a possibly tire-

some wait in line, a poor liquor service)
to enjoy specialties of the house.

Andrew [achson Restaurant, 221 Royal
St., serves excellent food in spacious sur-
roundings. Menu is limited, but'highly
imaginative. Lunch is distinctive and a

good buy.

Antoine’s Restaurant, 731 St. Louis St.
(reservations are not advisable on first
visit). If you are only curious, and not
truly interested in gourmet dining, the
cost will discourage you. Oysters Rocke-
feller is their most famous specialty. For
dessert, the crépes suzette is a must.

Arnaud’s Restaurant, 813 Bienville St.,
is capable of some of the best and some
of the worst cooking in New Orleans.
You will probably be more successful in
enjoying a good meal for luncheon rather
than dinner. Their two specialties are
trout meuniere and sautéed trout in brown
butter sauce.

Brennan’s French Restaurant, 417 Royal
St. (reservations are essential for break-
fast, which is served at any time). Don’t
try it for luncheon or dinner, but for
breakfast it is unsurpassed.

Acme Oyster House. 724 Iberville St.
(closed Sunday). One of the greatest
treats New Orleans offers is the feasting
upon raw oysters on the half shell at an
oyster bar. The Acme is the best oyster
bar in town. Only its main competitor
across the street, Fe/ix's. can approach it
in its offering of the best oysters you will
find.

Ristorante Tre Fontane, 615 Bienville
St. (reservations helpful). One of the

WHERE TO EAT—

(Continued from page 6)

city’s most elegant restaurants, decorated
tastefully in marble, it features a menu of
Italian .and New Orleans Specialties.
Prices on the a la carte menu are reason-

able.

Erny’s Restaurant and Pastry Shop, 918
Royal St., is a restaurant of extremely rea-
sonable prices where you are sure to enjoy
your meal. It is small, only about a dozen
tables. Featuring Creole cuisine, it offers
a fine oyster soup and an entree of mirli-
ton stuffed with shrimp. Breakfast fea-
tures hot Danish pastries.

French Marhet Restaurant and Pancahe
Manor, 816 Decatur St. (open every day,
7:00 am. to 10:00 p.m.). Here you will
find one of the best breakfasts in New
Orleans. A specialty is pain perdu, the
Creole equivalent of French toast. You
may also want to try a meal from their
luncheon menu, generally excellent and
at a very low price.

Johnny’s Po-Boy’s, 511 St. Louis St.
Only a block from the Royal Orleans Ho-
tel, it is convenient to the entire French
Quarter. If you want to indulge in one
of New Orleans’ famous poor boy sand-
wiches, this is one of the places to do it.

Dining in the Garden District

Commander’s Palace, 1403 Washington
Ave, is one of New Orleans’ famed res-
tauants. It serves some of the city’s best
food at reasonable prices in elegant sur-
roundings. There is a table d’hote and an
a la carte menu. It is wise to stick to the
a la carte offerings, especially the special-
ties listed in red. Eat on the patio if
weather permits and be sure to make res-
ervations.

Some of the most elegant and inex-
pensive food is served at Lotar’s Restau-
rant and Lounge, 2100 St. Charles Ave.
It is a combination of main dining room
and coffee shop, although the coffee shop
provides as pleasant surroundings as the
main room. The New Orleans’ specialty
of red beans and rice is recommended.

The Carihhean Room of the Pontchar-
train Hotel offers the most imaginative
versions of rich Creole cuisine. The best
of these is trout Veronique, poached trout
in wine served under a glazed hollandaise
sauce and green grapes.

Dining Elsewhere in the City

For some of the best shrimp in New
Orleans, remember Pascal’s Manale Res-
taurant, 1838 Napoleon Ave. There you
Fan order barbecued shrimp, shrimp 6
inches long and brought to the table
Wh91€~head, tail, shell, and all. The
Italian dishes are also excellent. Reserva-
tions are helpful.

Delightfully low prices and an excellent
kitchen mark one of the city’s finest res-
taurants. Berdou’s Restaurant, 300 Mon-
roe St., Gretna, La., is located 3 miles
from the French Quarter. The restaurant
specializes in great sauces, and you should
stick to meals featuring these. A complete-
dinner average-s $3.50. Lunch prices are
even lower.

Christopher Blake’s, 916 Lafayette St.,
specializes in French food of a generally
excellent and unusual caliber. You can
rely on the table d’hote menu, which
changes weekly. The restaurant is found
in an old house on the edge of the cen-
tral business district. Christopher Blake’s
also offers the French souper, a meal
served from 10:00 pm. to midnight.

The best lakefront restaurant serving
seafood is Fontana’s Seafood Restaurant,
West End Park. The atmosphere is plain,
the service friendly. Some of the largest
and best soft-shell crabs are served. Prices
are very reasonable and a take-out service
is available.

New Orleans ”soul” food reaches its
peak at the Chez Helene, 1540 N. Rob-
ertson St. An extensive menu offers
dishes of excellence at extremely low
prices.

Le Ruth’s Restaurant, in addition to
Galatoire’s, enjoys the reputation for be-
ing one of the top two eating establish-
ments in New Orleans. Located at 636
Franklin St. on the West Bank, it is 5
minutes from the French Quarter. Reser-
vations are essential. Le Ruth’s is a classic,
rather than New Orleans, French restau-
rant. The menu is table d’hote and is
limited to 7 entrees and a daily specialty,
which is highly recommended. The wine
cellar is one of the best in the city.

The Dehnonico Restaurant, 1300 St.
Charles Ave., is a most comfortable fam-
ily restaurant. Unpretentious, it claims,
rightly, to be an old friend with good
food. It has been in business since 1895,
with reasonably priced, distinctive food.

For a poor boy sandwich that cannot be
topped, try those at Mother’s Restaurant,
401 Poydras St. Their poor boy sand-
wiches are legendary, and it would not be
surprising to see the line stretching into
the street during the lunch period from
12:00 noon to 2:00 pm.

For the dedicated meat eater, try the
Crescent City Steah House, 1001 N: Broad
Ave. All steaks are of generous Size and
come swimming in butter. Be sure to
order the au gratin potatoes. The restau-
rant atmosphere is charming, With cur-
tained booths and a jukebox playing old
New Orleans songs.

Spare-Time Activities
A Full-Time Job

New Orleans—the country’s second
largest seaport, the French Quarter, Gar-
den District, cemeteries, Creole cooking,
museums, the list is endless and offers a
taste for every palate and a sight for
every eye.

Ships. Flags. and Harbor Lights

Always a flourishing port, New Or-
leans continues its tradition of harbor ac-
tivity. Access to the docks is convenient;
spend a bit of time observing the loading
and unloading before you set off on a
cruise.

5.5. ”President” Cruise—The S.S.
President is the world’s largest side--
wheel sightseeing steamboat. Cruises last
21/2 hours, leaving from 2:30 pm. to
5:00 pm. daily. The 30-mile trip covers
all the sights of the harbor.

Bayou Trip—Board this replica of the
stern-wheelers, the Mar/é Twain, for a 40-
mile trip. You will travel the Mississippi
River, the Intercoastal Waterway, the
Bayou Barataria, and the Harvey Canal.
The ship departs from the Canal Street
docks at 11 :00 am.

Historic Spots in the Old City

When you set off on your tour of the
French Quarter, frequently referred to as
Vieux Carré, it would be wise to travel
by foot. Streets are narrow and often one-
way in this jumble of antique shops, tea-
rooms, flop houses, wealthy homes, bars,
art studios, nightclubs, secreted courtyards,
restored apartments, and dilapidated flats.
Some places to see are:

[achson Square—This is the historic
center of the French Quarter. By standing
near the Decatur Street side of the square
you can view the bronze statue of General
Jackson, constructed in 1856, silhouetted
against the facade of the old St. Louis
Cathedral.

St. Louis Cathedral.—The Cathedral
faces Jackson Square; is rich in religious,
historic, architectural, and artistic interest;

_ and stands as the city’s central shrine.

The Cahildo and the Preshj'tere.——The
Cabildo was the ancient seat of Spanish
rule. The Presbytere, originally intended
for religious purposes, became state prop-
erty. Today both buildings contain relics
and exhibits of New Orleans’ history.

Maspero’s Exchange, 400 Chartres, was
once the Exchange Coffee House, where
in the 1800’s judges, generals, soldiers,
merchants, and planters met for commer-
cial exchange. It was one of the principal
sites of slave auctions.

The Old French Marhet stands opposite
Jackson Square.

AVMA Golf Outing at
Lakewood Country Club

The 1972 AVMA Golf Outing will be
held Monday, July 17, at Lakewood Coun-
try Club in New Orleans. Lakewood, the
site of the Greater New Orleans Open on
the PGA Tour, offers a challenge to the
ardent golfer as well as a thing of beauty
to the not-so-average golfer.

Shotgun tee-off will be at 9:00 am.
Groups will be assigned on Sunday even—
ing, July 16, and will be posted at the
entrance of the club Monday morning.
Late entries will be filled in Monday
morning.

Sportr and Travel magazine photogra-
phers will cover the tournament. A com-
plimentary photo of your foursome will
be given to each participant. Fort Dodge
Laboratories will also be on hand to pre-
sent each participant with a helpful gift
for all players who may lose golf balls in
any of Lakewood’s many lakes.

After play, the 19th hole is the time for
fellowship and fun at a buffet for all
participants. Sport; and Travel magazine
will sponsor the awards program, and
trophies will be presented to low gross
and low net in both ladies and gentle-
men flights. Trophies will be available for
the ”longest drive hole” and the ”closest
to the hole” and for other exceptional

shots in both ladies’ and gentlemen’s
flights.

 

SPARE-TIME ACTIVITIES—
(Continued from page 7)

Toe Merclyantr’ Exchange, 126 Royal
St., was another meeting place of traders,
auctioneers, gamblers, and merchants.

Andaoon’r Home is located at 505
Dauphine St.

Ola’ Aorintlte H owe, 238 Bourbon, was
the haunt for 60 years of absinthe-sipping

adventurers, traders, and Creole gentle-
men.

Bralatoar Residence, 520 Royal St., was
built in 1816 by a wine merchant. The
entresol, or mezzanine, is a half story
above the ground floor and served as a
storage area for wine.

LaBranc/ae Home, 700 Royal St., offers
one of . the finest examples of cast-iron
decorations of entwined leaves and acorns.

Court of the Two Lions, at the corner
of Royal and Toulouse Streets, has been
a constant source of delight to photog-
raphers, painters, and writers.

The Garden District—the American
Side of the City

Here are stately mansions, surrounded
by gardens of azaleas, wisteria, and Con-
federate Jasmine. The classic style and

8

 

of New Orleans is famous for the "cornstalk
fence" which surrounds it. This home is on the
corner of Prytania and Fourth Streets.

high columns of these gracious homes
transport you back to the elusive past.

A ride on the St. Charles Ave. street-
car, at a fare of only 15c, is an excellent
way to begin your tour.

The Moran house, at 1448 Fourth, may
well be one of the most beautiful homes
of the Garden District. Built in 1859,
the home and its grounds occupy nearly
an entire block.

The mansion at 2343 Prytania St. is
now the Louise S. McGehee School, a pri-
vate school for girls. Built in 1870, it is
a fine example of classic style.

One of the finest examples of late
antebellum architecture is the Jordan
house, at 1415 Third.

At 2340 Prytania St., the oldest house
in the Garden District was built in 1838
and is one example of the New Orleans
cottage style of architecture.

A neoclassic style characterizes the
Chester A. Mehurin home at 1427 Sec-
ond, believed to have been built prior to
1850.

The. Gordon O. Ewin house at 2520
Prytania St., built in 1853, is enhanced
w1th lacey ironwork.

The Judge John M. Wisdom house at
1239 First was built in neoclassic style in
1840.

Cities of the Dead

New Orleans cemeteries have frequent-
ly been described as little cities because of
the above-ground interment necessary due
to the high water table. Walking in the
city’s older cemeteries, you will see tombs
constructed of the same materials used in
the homes of the early 1800’s. It has been
said that the architecture of the cemeteries
is more impressive than that of the city
itself.

The oldest cemtery is St. Louis Number
One, on Basin Street between St. Louis

and Toulouse Streets. You will see every
shape, of tomb, from pyramidal, to cir-
cular, to the favored cube form.

At North Claiborne and Bienville is
St. Louis Number Two. Built in 1822,
this cemetery is larger than, but not as
picturesque as, St. Louis Number One.

St. Louis Number Three, located at the
end of Esplanade Avenue, is the least in-
teresting of the St. Louis cemeteries. It
was acquired by St. Louis Cathedral in
1856.

At St. Roch and Derbigny you will find
St. Roch’s, probably the best-designed
cemetery in New Orleans. The cemetery
bears the appearance of a fortress. Stark-
ly symmetrical, balance is achieved
through the positioning of the chapel and
towering entrance gate.

The largest of New Orleans’ cemeteries
is located in Metairie. Relatively modern,
it was formerly a racetrack until converted
into a cemetery in the 1870’s. Burials are
below and above ground because of the
comparative dryness of the soil.

Sightseers Haven—The Museums

The museums of New Orleans are
crammed with the memorabilia of the old
city. Remnants of the past, such as old
Mardi Gras ball gowns and pharmaceu-
tical instruments of 100 years ago, are on
View.

Merieult House, 533 Royal St., is one
of the oldest buildings in New Orleans
and houses one of the city’s most impor—
tant museums, the Historic New Orleanr
Collection. It is open Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday from 1:30 until 4:30 pm.
You will see paintings, prints, documents,
maps, and rare manuscripts.

The Louisiana Historical Association
maintains the Confederate Mater/7n at 929
Camp St. A section is devoted exclusively
to Jefferson Davis and family. The mu-
seum, established in 1891 and considered
one of the best of its kind, displays Con-
federate uniforms, battle flags, weapons,
medical instruments, and the boots, spurs,
saddlecloth, and mess kit of one of Mos-
by’s Rangers. Hours are 10:00 am. to
4:00 p.m., Tuesdays through Saturdays.

If New Orleans’ heritage of jazz fasci-
nates you, a trip to the Jazz Maremn will
prove most entertaining. Available for
purchase are books, records, posters, and
postcards on jazz. The museum is open
10:00 am. to 5:00 p.m., Mondays
through Saturdays.

Luncheon Features Premiere
of AVMA's First PR Film

Conventioneers attending the Inaugu-
ral Luncheon Sunday got a special treat
following the program. They were the
audience for the world premiere of T/ae
Cozr'enant, the first public relations film

about veterinary medicine ever produced
by AVMA.

President John R. McCoy, (UP ’40),
who last year in his inaugural address
called for expansion of AVMA's public
relations program to increase the visibil-
ity of the profession, introduced the
film saying that he could think of no
better way to make veterinarians more
visible than with this motion picture.

Designed especially for veterinarians to
use in public presentations to nonveteri-
narians, the 20-minute sound/color film
shows the many ways today’s doctor of
veterinary medicine fulfills a responsi-
bility similar to Noah’s ancient covenant
to care for all living creatures on earth.
After establishing the title theme, The
Covenant briefly describes veterinary
medical education, then goes on to out-
line the profession’s contributions in pri-
vate practice, public health and regula-
tory work, research, and military service.
The film also mentions activities in such
areas as aquaculture and wildlife ecology,
and includes a short, humorous segment
on 200 animals and medicine.

Starting next month the film will be
made available, without charge, exclu-
sively to members of AVMA, its student
chapters, and its auxiliary. After Novem-
ber 1, in addition to being loaned from
the AVMA film library, T/ae Covenant
will be distributed to school and com-
munity groups throughout the nation.
An estimated quarter of a million peo-
ple a year will see the film this way.

A shorter 14-minute version of the
film is also being made. This version,
tailored for a quarter—hour television time
slot, will be distributed nationally to TV
stations starting in January of 1973. The
anticipated television audience for Toe
Covenant is 6 to 9 million people a year.

All-Day Showing July I?

For those who missed the premiere
Sunday, T/ae Covenant will be shown all
day Wednesday, July 19, in Room 10
on the second floor of The Rivergate.
Shows start each hour on the hour be-
ginning at 10:00 am. The last screen-
ing will start at 5:00 pm.

Order forms will be available for those
who wish to take them home in antici-
pation of later reserving the film so they
can show it to career classes, serVice
clubs, and similar groups in their com-

munities.

 

AVMA Placement Service
To Arrange Interviews

Continuing the policy established at the
annual meeting in Dallas 5 years ago,
the AVMA Placement Service will ar-
range personal interviews between mem-
bers of the Association seeking employ-
ment and representatives of organizations
wishing to employ veterinarians. The ser-
vice is available without charge to AVMA
members in good standing who have reg-
istered with the Placement Service and to
exhibitors at the annual meeting, as well
as to potential employers registered with
the Placement Service.

Both candidates and employers, who
have not previously done so, are urged to
register at the Placement Service office
immediately upon arrival at The River-
gate in New Orleans. The Placement Ser—
vice office will be located in the registra-
tion area.

All advance registrants, both veterinari-
ans and employees, should check in with
the Placement Service office immediately
upon arrival to establish a contact point
for arrangement of interviews.

While the Placement Service does not
handle practice positions, a bulletin board
will be available for posting information
regarding openings in clinical practices
and resumes of veterinarians seeking prac-
tice positions.

 

Point Credit for Reserve Officers

Air Force Reserve Officers

Air Force Veterinary Reserve Officers
may receive point credit for attending ses-
sions of the AVMA convention in New
Orleans, La., this week. Reserve officers
may obtain necessary forms to complete
and forward to their military organiza-
tions for reserve training credit by re-
questing them at the scheduled USAF
Veterinary Service meeting. Wearing the
uniform is optional.

Army Reserve Officers

Veterinarians holding Reserve commis-
sions in the Army Veterinary Corps who
are not on active duty may receive credit
for attending certain sessions at the
AVMA convention to be held in New
Orleans, 1.21., this week, provided such at-
tendance at any session is for a period of
not less than 2 hours and registration is
accomplished as noted below. Not more
than one credit can be granted for any
single calendar day.

Military registration will not be ac-
complished at the general meeting. Re-
serve officers will certify their own reg-
istration and attendance on DA Form
1380 through their appropriate head-
quarters.

 




The Rivergate — Spectacular
Setting tor AVMA Convention

The Rivergate, one of the newest ex-
hibit halls in the country, will be the set-
ting for the 109th annual convention of
the AVMA in New Orleans this week.
Situated at the foot of Canal Street, with-
in a stone’s thro-w of the Mississippi River,
the spectacular exhibit center is within
walking distance of the major downtown
hotels, business district, French Quarter,
Bourbon and Royal Streets, and numerous
historical landmarks.

The main area of the Rivergate, where
AVMA’s professional and scientific ex-
hibits are set up, contains 130,000 sq. ft.
of clear-span, column-free space. Opened
up in full, the hall seats 17,500 people;
divided into two sections, the North Hall
seats 4,700 and the South Hall, 12,800.

In its conference rooms will be held
most of the convention’s scientific pro-
grams, including the seminars, all sec-
tion programs, exhibits of the autotutorial
programs, and programs of many allied
veterinary groups.

An enormous concrete canopy, 500 ft.
long and more than two sto-ries high,
covers the roadway and sidewalk area im-
mediately adjacent to the Rivergate’s front
elevation and entrances. And there is
parking for 500 cars on two floor levels.

Plan a Complete CaII
At Convention Exhibits

More than one fifth of a mile of pro-
fessional exhibits await veterinarians in
the magnificent New Orleans Rivergate
Exposition Center this week at the
AVMA’s 109th annual meeting. At each
of the 106 attractive booths in the South
Hall, especially trained representatives
await you to discuss in depth your ques-
tions and interest in their pro-duct,
whether it be new and improved drugs,
biologicals, instruments, or equipment.

”Stop and see us,” they invite. Dr.
John R. McCoy (UP ’40), AVMA presi-
dent urges conventioners to accept the in-
vitation, saying, ”There is much to be
learned by scheduling sufficient time to
review each of these highly informative
exhibits. Plan a complete call —— not just
a quick ‘visit’.”

In the same area as the professional
exhibits the scientific exhibits and dem-
onstrations are set up. Here 28 exhibits
—— the largest number to be exhibited in
recent years — provide visual and audio in-
formation on such diverse topics as prog-
ress with animal technicians, today’s vet-
erinarian in the space program, problem-
oriented medical record in veterinary
medicine, hog cholera target 1972, and
modern veterinary radiology. Exhibitors

of scientific exhibits include individual
veterinarians, allied veterinary medical
groups, government agencies, and the
American Medical Association.

All exhibits are open from 10:00 am.
to 5 :00 pm. on Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday.

 

Wolins Exhibit

Pharmacal Corporation of Melville,
N.Y., was inadvertently omitted from the
convention program. It is, therefore,

THE NEWER ANTIVIVISECTIONISTS

MAURICE B. VISSCHER

Distinguished Service & Regents’ Professor Emeritus
Department of Physiology, University of Minnesota

(Read November 11, 1971)

THE NINETEENTH CENTURY saw the birth ‘of
vigorous animal protection movements both in
Europe and North America. The leading. ex-
ponents were in England, and included numerous
members of the British aristocracy. Even Queen
Victoria gave a helping hand. A special and
early target of the newly formed animal humane
societies, such as the Royal Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals in London and the
American SPCA in New York, was the use of
living animals in medical and other biological
study. The invention of the term vivisection to
categorize such use was a stroke of genius. As
Kathleen Szasz has put it:

The lumping together of all laboratory experiments
conducted on animals under the gory but misleading
heading vivisection has a very deﬁnite purpose and any
modern advertising agency using depth psychology to
ﬁnd the sales gimmick with the greatest public appeal
would be proud to have invented it. For the inno-
cent, or not so innocent, public the word “Vivisection”
conjures up the image of a white—coated Frankenstein
monster cutting up a screaming, helpless animal tied
to an operating table.1

There was a rising crescendo of agitation against
so—called vivisection, which led to the enactment
by the British Parliament of the Cruelty to
Animals Act of 1876, a law placing all scientiﬁc
study of warm-blooded animals under bureau-

cratic control. ,It has hampered medical teaching
and research in Britain ever since. Especially in
experimental surgery and neurology the law has
discouraged innovation and inhibited progress. It
has also made the use of cats and dogs in scientiﬁc
study extremely expensive.

Time was when antivivisectionists argued that
scientiﬁc studies on animals were futile or mis—
leading, and that in any case it was ethically im-
proper to sacriﬁce the liberty or the life of a lower
animal to achieve scientiﬁc knowledge. Today,
however, it has become rationally absurd to claim
that animal experimentation has not yielded great
human good in improved understanding and con-

1 Kathleen Szasz Petishism? (New York, Holt, Rine-
hart and Winston, 1968), p. 71.

trol of health and disease, and in fact in under—
standing life processes in general. It is stlll pos—

‘sible, of course, to maintain by personal whim a

value system that holds that the life of a mosquito
or a mouse is as important as the life of a man,
a woman, or a human child. However, in a
culture that sacriﬁces the lives of many billions of
animals yearly for food, it seems rather absurd to
focus ethical attention primarily on the relatively
miniscule fraction of the total number of animals
that are employed in medical and other biological
science studies.

The newest breed of opponents of the use of
living animals in science has adopted a more
sophisticated tactic. It does not deny the evident
successes of animal experimentation in the control
of disease in man and other animals, it does not
deny that great new insights into the phenomena of
life have been obtained through the use of living
animals. Rather, the newer antivivisectionists ad—
mit all this but claim that if only the biologists
would take the trouble to do so, all the useful
discoveries could be made by computer technology
or by the use of tissue cultures or single-celled
The new attackers of the use of
living animals in biological research are publicizing
their points of view in paid advertisements in
metropolitan newspapers, including the New York
Times? and the National Observer.3 The older
antivivisection organizations are jumping on the
bandwagon of the proponents of substitution of
computers and tissue cultures for living animals.
Figure 1 presents an example.

It would be incorrect to say that all current
opposition to the use of living animals in scientiﬁc
study has shifted to the approach I have just
outlined. There are still many voices attacking the
use of living lower animals in medical and othe:
scientiﬁc study on purely moral grounds. In
this area too a new twist has been developed.

It is of some interest that the editors of the
American Scholar, the organ of the United
Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa, devoted nine double-
column pages of its Summer, 1971, issue to an
exposition by Dr. Catherine Roberts, a biologist
by training herself, of the proposition that social
(moral) evolution will inevitably make the utiliza—
tion of living lower animals in scientiﬁc study
totally unacceptable to the human race. Roberts
does not deny the pragmatic utility of animal
experimentation. She does not deny a unique
place of primacy for the genus Homo in the evolu-
tionary scale. Nevertheless she ﬁnds the taking
of life from any sentient lower animal to be ab-
horrent to her scheme of morality, which she
asserts must, by evolution, eventually be shared by
all decent people. She says: '

Evolving life can therefore no longer tolerate the
biological injustice of inﬂicting agony upon animals

to ameliorate and prolong the physical existence of
human lives. Brief respites from suffering and death
made possible by the ruthlessness of scientists against
lower life contribute nothing whatever to the spiritual
ascent of mankind. Evolving life has need instead of
gentle souls like Saint Francis and Gandhi to show
us how to come together to live lives of.nonv1olence,
in joy and peace with the whole of sentIent creation.
For the meek, strengthened and made wise 1n their
decisions by divine sanction and their spiritual her1~
tage, shall inherit the earth. .

The choice to abolish the sentient laboratory ammal
is an evolutionary inevitability and a moral impera-
tive.4

When the ofﬁcial organ of a prestigious
scholarly honor society sees ﬁt to provide oppor«
tunity for expression of such assertions it cannot
be said that the issue involved is dead.

Well-intentioned people frequently are the
source of great trouble in this world. The patron
philosophic saint fOr many of the neo-antivivisec~
tionists is Albert Schweitzer. He was a very
talented humanistic philosopher, theologian, phy-
sician, and musician. He wrote beautifully and
appealingly about the common principle of “the
will to live” and about “reverence for life”———all
life, plant as well as animal.

Schweitzer was a complex personality who com-
bined a generally broad philosophic grasp of the re-
alities of the natural world with the rigid personal
ethics which grew out of his contemplation of the
consequences of the “universal will-to-live” ideas
of earlier philosophers. He recognized the di—
lemma in which he found himself, as is evident
when he wrote:

The world isa ghastly drama of will—to-live divided
against itself. One existence makes its way at the
cost of another; one destroys the other. One will-to-
live merely exerts its will against the other, and has
no knowledge of it. But in me the will-to—live has
come to know about other wills-to—live. There is in
it a yearning to arrive at unity with itself, to become
universal.5

The philosophy of reverence for life became a
consuming passion for Schweitzer in his later
life, but his ideas about it began to appear as
early as 1919. In a sermon he gave on February
23 of that year he pronounced his Conviction as to
its great import for man while he detailedmwith
sorrow it would appears-the enormous gap be-

tween the facts of life in nature and his ideal.
He said:

Reverence for life and sympathy .With other lives is
of supreme importance for this world of ours. Nature
knows no similar reverence for life. It produces life
a thousandfold in the most meaningful way and de-
stroys it a thousandfold in the most meaningless way.
In every stage of life, right up to the level of man,
terrible ignorance lies over all creatures. They have
the will to live but no capacity for compassion toward
other creatures. They can’t feel what happens inside
others. They suffer but have no compassion. The
great struggle for survival by which nature .is main—
tained is in strange contradiction with itself. Crea—
tures live at the expense of other creatures. Nature
permits the most horrible cruelties to be committed.
It impels insects by their instincts to bore holes into
other insects, to lay their eggs .in them so that mag~
gots may grow there and live off the caterpillar,
thus causing it a slow and painful death. Nature lets
ants band together to attack poor little creatures and
hound them to death. Look at the spider. How grue-
some is the craft that nature taught it !

Nature looks beautiful and marvelous when you
View it from the outside. But when you read its
pages like a book, it is horrible. And its cruelty is
so senseless! The most precious form of life is sacri-
ﬁced to the lowliest.6

The Albert Schweitzer thesis of reverence for
life has been distorted by the antivivisectionists
among his admirers. However, Schweitzer him-
self was deﬁnitely not opposed to the use of
living animals in scientiﬁc research. In fact he
speciﬁcally endorsed such use as compatible with
his philosophy of reverence for life. He would,
to be sure, want each scientist to feel a kind of
remorse about sacriﬁcing the life of any and
every animal. What he actually said about
scientists using animals was “In each individual
case they must ask themselves whether there is a
real necessity for imposing such a sacriﬁce upon
a living creature.” 7

For Schweitzer the will—to-live was a property
of all life, from the unicellular organism to the
giant oak or to the primate. It was to him a
test of the evolutionary progress of the genus
Homo that at least what he considered to be its
more perceptive examples could adhere to the
principle that all life has a kind of sanctity. But
it is a perversion of Schweitzerian sentiment to
suppose that the substitution of tissue cultures for

rodents, or felines or canines in scientiﬁc work
would exonerate an investigator or relieve him of
the need to question the necessity of killing any
living cell.

As many others of us tend to do, Schweitzer
sought out an ethic which seemed to him to pro-
vide an ideal framework for his own preferred be-
havior. He distinguished very sharply, un-
doubtedly too sharply for reality, between the
living and the non-living. Today the line is
being blurred by chemical discoveries. Tomorrow
there may be no line at all. Schweitzer also
grossly exaggerated the capacity of the run of men
to feel the romantic sentiments which he him-
self felt toward subhuman life. Almost no one
really shares his universal principle of reverence
for life in practice. Schweitzer said:

Whenever I injure life of any sort, I must be quite
clear whether it is necessary. Beyond the unavoid-
able, I must never go, not even with what seems in-
signiﬁcant. The farmer, who has mown down a
thousand ﬂowers in his meadow as fodder for his
cows, must be careful on his way home not to strike
off in wanton pastime the head of a single ﬂower by
the roadside, for he thereby commits a wrong against
life without being under the pressure of necessity.8

Reverence for life is a beautiful expression, but,
without many qualiﬁcations, it is meaningless in
the real world. Reverence for human life does
have great meaning, but even here overemphasis
on prolonging life, as in the hopelessly ill for whom
survival may be and often is simply a prolongation
of misery and pain, may become an inhumane
and unkind fetish. .

Kindness to sentient creatures is of course
another matter. Much of the support for the anti-
animal—experimentation movement comes from a
commendable desire to prevent pain on the part of
higher forms of animal life. However, the concern
is frequently so extreme and so distorted that the
end result is kind of misanthropic zoophilia.

Sentimental persons ﬁght to keep unclaimed im—
pounded animals, abandoned by their former
owners, out of the hands of medical and other
scientists. Such persons would prefer to have
these animals put to death uselessly in gas cham—
bers than to have them used for a humane pur-
pose. The sentimentalists in Great Britain and in
several states in America (Pennsylvania being
one)9 haVe managed to obtain laws which pro-

hibit the use of unclaimed animals in scientiﬁc
study. No matter that as a result tax money has
to be used to purchase similar animals at high
prices. Sentimentality must be served!

How has the relatively small group of opponents
of the use of animals in biologic study been able to
exert sufﬁcient inﬂuence to obtain such legislative
action? The answer is severalfold. First it may
be noted that very few owners of pet dogs or cats
would be emotionally at ease about turning his or
her personal pet over to a scientiﬁc laboratory.
They, unconsciously perhaps, identify stray
animals with their own pets and feel a kind of
guilt about letting someone else’s possible former
pet be so used. Second, there is great ignorance
about what actually happens to laboratory animals.
The antivivisectionists are at pains to create the
impression that scientists are sadistically inclined
and that horrible tortures await any creature that
falls into their hands. A few more visits to
laboratories by legislators and other laymen would
dispel such absurd notions. Meaningful studies
simply could not be made on struggling animals.
Of course, some studies do involve distress or even
pain. For example, one could not study anti-
cancer drugs in a meaningful way without in
many instances ﬁrst inducing the neoplasm it is
hoped to be able to control. But millions of
humans go through as great or worse suffering
with cancer every year. Is our system of values
.such that it is improper to expose a lower animal
to distress. comparable to that of the humans one
hopes we can learn how to heal? This is really
at the heart'of the ethical question about the use
of animals in biomedical research. Stated in such
a bald way few humans would agree with the
antivivisectionists.

But the opponents of such use of lower animals
rarely reveal their basic zoophilia and misanthropy.
And furthermore they have relatively large sums
of money touse for propaganda purposes. The
old men or women with animal pets as their main
or only companions too frequently leave large
legacies to antivivisection societies or to animal
humane societies which are often controlled by an
antivivisectionist fringe. The result is that well-
paid staff persons can spend their full time de—
vising strategy to hamper research on animals
under the guise of a “be kind to animals” ethic.

The prejudice of a sizable minority fraction
of the human race against the use of living animals
in medical and other biological study is'virtually
worldwide. Recently a proposal was put forward

[PROQ AMER. PHIL. soc.

in the Scientiﬁc and Technical Commission of the
Council of Europe, which condemned current
practices in animal experimentation and called for
elimination of much or even most use of living
animals by substituting tissue and cell cultures,
setting up an international program of subsidy for
tissue and cell culture laboratories, to be sup—
ported by the World Health Organization, pro~
hibiting scientiﬁc use of animals in secondary
schools and calling for substitution of motion
pictures for the use of living animals in the uni—
versities of member states. The recommendation
was endorsed by the Consultative Assembly and is
now before the Committee of Prime Ministers.10

The initiator of this action, Professor S. T.
Aygun, a member of the Commission on Science
and Technology, is a veterinarian from Ankara,
Turkey, who operates a tissue-culture laboratory.
He is also the scientiﬁc director of the Inter-
national Association Against Painful Experiments
on Animals. It is alarming to biological scientists
that laymen, as far as biology is concerned, should
ignore the testimony of major international bodies
of scientiﬁc experts, who uniformly condemned the
Aygun proposal as naive and dangerous, and in—
stead listened to the antivivisection and quasi—
antivivisection societies in passing this proposal.
The Consultative Assembly of the Council of
Europe even ignored the advice of its own Health
Commission in this matter.

The actions of the Council of Europe fortun—
ately do not have the force of law, but its recom—
mendations have a large psychological effect on its
member states. Following are some of the fea-
tures of Recommendation 621 (1971) by the
Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe:

The Assembly,

Condemning vivisectionist practices and methods
Wthh inﬂict unnecessary suffering upon animals;

Lay down the following terms of reference for the
Commission referred to above:

to .draft international legislation setting out the con-
ditions under which, and the scientiﬁc ground on
wh1ch, experiments on live animals may be authorized;

forbid in secondary schools experiments on live ani-
mals for teaching purposes, and limit these experi—
ments in university teaching by having them replaced
by new visual methods.

A new organization was established in Britain in
1969 called the Fund for the Replacement of

10 Recommendation 621 (1971) adopted on January 20,
1971, by the Consultative Assembly of the Council of
Europe.

VOL. 116, NO. 2, 1972]

Animals in Medical Experiments. Its acronym is
FRAME. It is registered as a charity and is
actively lobbying for measures that might reduce
the need for animals in research. Its point of view
has been described by Dr. Bernard Dixon under
the title “Animal Experimentation—The Real
Failure.” 11 A debate in the House of Commons
last spring attests to the likelihood that the new
organization will attempt to put additional pres-
sures on governments to write more restrictive
laws governing the scientiﬁc study of living
animals, although it must be pointed out that the
public stance of FRAME is that of an organiza—
tion deeply devoted to the progress of biological
science. One of the mechanisms FRAME pro—
poses is the granting of scholarships “to enable
those trained in medicine and biology to study a
branch of pure science or mathematics, and those
trained in these disciplines to study biology and/ or
medicine.” The obvious implication is that more
sophisticated use of physics, and especially of
mathematics, would accomplish the main objective
of the organization, which is to reduce the use of
living whole animals in research.

Society has much to lose by erosion of the
freedom of biological scientists to choose their own
animal subjects for study. Biologists already use
cell cultures and tissue cultures for those types
of study for which they are really suited. How-
ever to imagine that integrated brain functions
or the control of the circulation or respiration, or
renal function in relation to body water balance, to
mention just a sample of the thousands of bio—
logical problems for which the use of tissue cul—
tures or cell cultures would be an absurdity, is an
evidence of ignorance or prejudice or both.

Before the American Philosophical Society it is
perhaps not inappropriate to bring up the basic
question of the logical justiﬁcation for an ethic
which places the genus Homo in a position of
mastery over the rest of the animal kingdom
and the entire plant kingdom as well. In the
days of widespread acceptance of the Judaic
account of creation and adherence to a literal
interpretation of the Book of Genesis there was
no apparent problem because it is written that
man was to have dominion over every other living
thing. But the recognition that all life evolved
from simpler forms, and that man himself is dis—
tinguished from his closer animal cousins only by

11 Bernard Dixon, “Animal Experimentation—the Real
Failure,” New Scientist and Science Journal, Aprll 8,
1971.

THE NEWER ANTIVIVISECITONISTS 161

a number of fortunate mutations, has changed
the picture. By what logic now can man blithely
assume his role of absolute sovereignty? If there
is no logical justiﬁcation then the antivivisection—
ists are right. Of course, society at large has
made a pragmatic decision which carries on the
biblical authorization for Homo sapiens to domi-
nate the world of life. Parenthetically it may be
suggested that it was undoubtedly the pragmatic
experience of the author(s) of the Book of
Genesis that was responsible for the dictum in—
corporated therein. But general acceptance of an
ethical proposition does not make it right. I
myself would be an antivivisectionist, I think, if I
could not ﬁnd adequate logical and factual justi-
ﬁcation for placing Homo sapiens in a category
of living beings far removed in mental capacities
from any other extant form of life.

The basic justiﬁcation, therefore, in my opinion,
for acceptance of the ethic that says it is proper
for man to use other animals in decent ways to
serve his own purposes, lies in the large gap that
exists between man and other beasts with respect
to mental capacities. Once one has accepted this
principle as factual there is no room for valid
argument that the use of man’s animal distant
cousins for scientiﬁc study is improper. One
might argue about the justiﬁcation for producing
pain, or in other broader words, about the con—
ditions of use, but the basic principle of justiﬁ—
ability of use should be settled. Nevertheless this
is the point of the disagreement between biologists
and antivivisectionists, including the newer ones
who claim simply to want to reduce the numbers
of animals sacriﬁced.

Despite logic it seems virtually inevitable that
an antivivisection movement will persist. Fortu—
nately for the United States the opponents on
ethical grounds of the use of living animals in
scientiﬁc study have not gone very far. They have,
as I have already noted, closed off some desirable
and appropriate sources of supply of certain
animals, principally dogs and cats, and they have
been able to get a few state legislatures to forbid
the use of living animals in secondary-school
instruction in biology. These laws should be re-
scinded. But their main thrusts have failed. The
new breed of antivivisectionist hopes to gain
ground by convincing the public and legislators
that biologists no longer need to study living
whole animals—that computers or single cells or
tissue cultures will do better. In its sentimental
naiveté the public might be misled. There are

 




162

resolutions before the present Congress of the
United States which would serve their purposes,
such as the following:

Resolved by the House of Representatives (the
Senate concurring), That it is the sense of Congress
that the Federal Government should take all appropri-
ate steps to develop new research methods for its re-
search projects so that animals will no longer be
required for such projects and should assist and en-
courage other public and private entities to develop
such methods for their research projects.

The Congress, let us hope, will not be so mis-
guided as to pass them.

The late John Dewey considered the ethics of
animal experimentation in an essay that he wrote
in 1909. His perceptive analysis of the basis of
the antivivisection controversy is as pertinent to-
day as it was then. He wrote:

What is the duty of the community regarding legis-
lation that imposes special restrictions upon the per-
sons engaged in scientiﬁc experimentation with ani-
mals? That it .is the duty of the state to pass general
laws against cruelty to animals is a fact recognized by
well nigh all civilized states. But opponents of ani-
mal experimentation are not content with such general
legislation, they demand what is in effect—if not
legally—class legislation, putting scientiﬁc men under
peculiar surveillance and limitation. . . . Unpreju-
diced people naturally inquire after the right and
wrong of this matter. Hearing accusations of wan-
tonly cruel deeds actuated by no higher motive than
passing curiosity brought against workers in labora-
tories and teachers in classrooms, at ﬁrst they may be
moved to believe that additional special legislation is
required. Further thought leads, however, to a fur-
ther question if these charges of cruelty are justiﬁed,
why are not those guilty of it brought up for trial in
accordance with the laws already provided against
cruelty to animals? Consideration of the fact that the
remedies and punishments already provided are not
resorted to by those so vehement in their charges
against scientiﬁc workers leads the unprejudiced in—
quirer to a further conclusion. Agitation for new
laws is not so much intended to prevent speciﬁc in-

stances of cruelty to animals as to subject scientiﬁc
inquiry to hampering restrictions. The moral issue
changes in this question: What ought to be the moral
attitude of the public to the proposal to put scientiﬁc
inquiry under restrictive conditions? No one who
really asks himself this question (without mixing it
up with the other question of cruelty to animals that
is taken care of by already existing laws), can I
imagine, be in doubt as to its answer. Nevertheless,
one consideration should be emphasized. Scientiﬁc
inquiry has been the chief instrumentality in bringing
men from barbarism to civilization, from darkness to
light, while it has incurred, at every step, determined
opposition from the powers of ignorance, misunder-
standing, and jealousy. It is not so long ago, as years
are reckoned, that a scientist in a physical or chemical
laboratory was popularly regarded as a magician en-
gaged in unlawful pursuits, or as in impious converse
with evil spirits, about whom all sorts of detrimental
stories were circulated and believed. Those days
have gone: generally speaking, the value of free sci-
entiﬁc inquiry as an instrumentality of social progress
and enlightenment is acknowledged. At the same
time, .it is still possible, by making irrelevant emo-
tional appeals and obscuring the real issues to galva-
nize into life something of the old spirit of misunder-
standing, envy, and dread of science. The point at
issue in the subjection of animal experimenters to
special supervision and legislation is thus deeper than
at ﬁrst sight appears: in principle, it involves the re-
vival of the animosity to discovery and to the applica-
tion to life of the fruits of discovery which, upon the
whole, has been the chief foe of human progress, it
behooves every thoughtful individual to be constantly
on the alert against every revival of this spirit, in
whatever guise it presents itself.”

Eternal vigilance is the price, not only of per—
sonal liberty, but of progress in biological science
so long as an antivivisection movement exists.
That movement will almost certainly persist so
long as the human race survives, because Homo
sapiens is not a fully sapient creature.

Dear Miss Gould:

This is in further reply to your September 15
letter which was acknowledged by my secretary
on September 20.

Inasmuch as the Animal Welfare Institute does
not meet the specific criteria required to make
it eligible as a scientific exhibitor at our
annual meetings, the only other alternative is
to participate as a professional exhibitor at
the proscribed rates as you have done in the
past.

Thank you for your continuing interest in pro-
