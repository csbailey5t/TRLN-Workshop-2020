Wearing the Evidence

“She has all Nature skinned” was what somebody said
about a woman wearing various kinds of furs in collars, muffs
and trimmings, and plumes on her head. Most women would
shrink from the touch of any of the animals alive, and would
have been horriﬁed to see any of them dying in traps or shot.

If anyone had asked the woman how she could choose and
buy furs and feathers, she might possibly have answered that
the animals and birds were already dead before she bought them,
so why not use them. It would be hard to convince her that
they were killed on purpose for her, and that the hunter, the
wholesaler, drummer. and retailer were in her employ.

“Life” had an excellent cartoon years ago, which had
scores of ghosts, half transparent shapes of fox, rabbit, mink,
squirrel and bird, all following after two women clothed in what
the ghosts said were “their furs and feathers.”

Traps are cruelly efficient, catching “ﬂukes” as ﬁrmly as
marketable pelts. The Victims are a long time dying of hun-
ger, thirst, cold and fright, for trappers can’t make hourly nor
even daily Visits.

Can any article which is itself a picture of agony and death
be truly decorative? It can be dyed and sewed and padded
and lined and become a garment, though most furs are cut
up and worn in bands and strips too small to be considered
clothes at all. It can be an interesting exhibit. It can be edu-
cational, like a curiosity in a museum. But as usually worn,
fur is not decorative. To wear it with satisfaction, a person
must be either ignorant or hard hearted. Wearers would be
indignant if accused of ignorance or adamantine hearts, but
they parade around wearing the evidence.
