DOING LEAST HARM

Every force has its form.

_-Shaker saying

when danger comes

a grizzly bear or a wolf
muskoxen run to form a circle
horns out tails to the inside
their young in the center
then stand their ground

this doesn't work well against guns

a man watched muskoxen dying

and one day began trapping a herd
calves cows bulls one by one

took them to his fenced—in farm
trained his dogs to keep away
because they looked like wolves

and left the beasts alone

months later walking in that field

he saw come loping over the rise

his youngest dog before he could yell
the oxen stamped into a ring

horns outside low to the ground

their rumps together

with him inside

Living With the Wounnded

The doe in the backyard is my secret, mine and the hillside’s.
She jumped the fence last week and stayed, nuzzling her way
through weeds and briars, eating the pear trees. When I go out
she lopes away. She is all muscle and highheels, this teenager,
slipping behind the hedgerow.

At dusk she settles in the grass, chewing her cud, watching me
through the kitchen window. I know that look from somewhere, and
when it comes to me I laugh. I am prime time. How long has this
been going on, I wonder, me on my stage and the hillside full of
animals?

We are so tolerant. The doe browses from bush to tree,
sharp-stepping around the cat. My dog lies chewing grass,
embarrassed. "That is a deer," I say to her. "She is in our
yard. What kind of watchdog are you?"

The dog wags her tail faintly, and pretends fatigue.

When a shot rings out I feel wild grief. I run to the sink and
clutch it, hoisting myself as if to peer an extra six inches

into a fear I cannot run from. The dog is puzzled, watching me.
Suddenly I see the doe, under the apple tree, frozen as I am. I
am so thankful. This strange and foolish passion for an animal I
cannot help has left me helpless. I am becoming wwild too.
"Remember," my housemate said, "to leave a note for the cleaning
lady." I remember about the note, but not what’s in it. I have
an urge to lick the pencil. "Lupe," I write, and leave this on
the sink, diﬁder the window, "please don’t touch the deer in the
backyard. ‘1 like it. Thanks. Mary."

The Grandmother Came Down to Visit Us

When the spider dropped down from the ceiling
Only Phil and I moved to save it

in a room full of people fearing

the shadow-weaver, the oldest gift giver.

We dropped it among suburban flowers ,
then went back in to get drunk,

finished every bottle in that house

to empty death

<3: then, full glasses of whiskey in our hands
& new bottles of wine in our pockets

we went back to the dormitory

where the workshOp director

said to Phil

What’s happened?

You were such a good Indian all week.

The grandmother came down

to visit us and they all want to hurt her
Phil said in his laughing voice

her web between our hands

as we left that house.

Springing the Traps

Lvening,

The planets hanging like ﬂakes
Inside the edge of their orbits,‘
The ﬁelds locked in place,
Their long successions
Dovetajled into the dark.

This is the landscape of habit.

Nights like this _
I ﬁnd my way without a lam
Down to the trap-line

My neighbor has strung
Along the pond’s reedy shore.

All around it lives pass through
The surface of the earth.

The dark behind my eyes

Fills my body, my breath

Trails off into the trees,

A part of all that rises.

Before me the pond is perfect

And ﬁlled with a wintry glow.

Fish dance like foxﬁre

On the tongues of the sunken traps.

I jam a stick down each throat,

And one by one

The traps go off like gunshots
Barking across the ﬁelds,
Like ice cracking

Through bedrock, or steel
Snapping the bones.

And it is paltry little,
Which is all that can be done.

ROBERT GI BB

 




IT SAT ON MY TONGUE ALL DAY

It sat on my tongue all day, the silence of the animals:
I wondered how I'd manage,

how shop, how smile, how manage this thing called living.
If I turned my head I heard them and became unfit.

It sat on my tongue all day, to mock

that phrase of accomplishment, 'the quality of life.‘
It sat on my tongue all day, to cry out

'Take away our hearts of stone.‘

It sat on my tongue all day, like Isaiah's coal-—the question:

What was the name of the doctor,
his assistant, assistants, his nurses?

it sat on my tongue all day to ask a neighbor,
"Do you know about this---can you believe this?"

It sat on my tongue all day to write the newspapers
and cell them:

tear down the laboratories

It sat on my tongue all day

by night I managed better

JOY TO THE FISHES

I hiked out to the end of Sunset Cliffs

& climbed the breakwater,

sneakers strung over my shoulder '

& a small collection of zen

poems in my ﬁst.

A minnow

that had sloshed out of someone’s baitbucket,
8i that I came within an inch of stepping on,
convulsed in agony.

Delighted to assist,

I tossed it back into its ocean:

swirling eddies sucked about the rocks,
white pythagorean sailboats

in the middle distance.

Kids raced the surf,

a labrador brought down a frisbee,

8: the sun sank pendulously

over the Paciﬁc shelf.

I shivered 8: descended,

slipping the unopened book

into my pocket ‘

& walked south

along the southern California coastline——
all the hills of Ocean Beach

glowing

in the rouged light

of midwinter sunset.

Even now

it pleases me to think

that somewhere

in the western coastal waters off America
that minnow is still swimming.

TURTLES

l

A friend told this story about snapping turtles:
One lived in the lake below his house.

He saw it sometimes, lumbering through the shallows,
Hunting, morosely, for something to eat.

A year later
He found a second turtle on a highway.
He brought it home and watched it

Crawl down the lawn. Unblinking, it entered the water.

3

Next morning: a splashing on the far shore.

He ran for his ﬁeld-glasses and looked:

In the ripples the two turtles were playing,
Mouthing and nuzzling, rolling over in the mud,
Their dank limbs hugging,

Like two bears honey-drunk, except

These were not bears but the thick reptile: turtle.

  

 
 
 
   
 

 

 

 

 
 

Later - '
They swam away, and the surface of the water

Closed above them, shaking like ﬁre.

 

   
 
   
 
 
 

I eat no meat.

I break no leaf in idleness.

I listen to the rocks breathing
In the wet meadows.

   
  

  

6
When I heard this story, I said:

The dead have no eyes.
The dead can cherish nothing
But their own white bones.

That is what being dead is.

 

7

But there is a way, one,
To live forever.

ANCIENT JUSTICE

AP wire service: "The chimps were being taken to a laboratory
in Maryland when the attack occurred around 2:15 a.m....the
police dispatcher didn't know why they were going to the lab

and couldn't explain the reason for the attack."

In the middle of the night they came.
The glare of lights and men's voices
drummed through the misty January air
like surgical steel striking the cage's
bars. The familiar one smelled

as he always did—-of smoke and food.

But an odor like death clung to the coat
of the other one. When they broke

our sleep and entered our den, I knew

it was for our lives. I said to my mate:

Better to die here than to place our fate

in hands that touch us but cannot feel.

As soon as I was clear of the cage,

I turned on it and bit that hideous smell.

I tore its fingers off and the opposable thumb,
the thing that gives them all their power. I bit
its ear, deaf anyway to our cages of grief.

I bit its face, as full of fear as my own.

It screamed till our keeper put it into a cage.
Without its thumb, it becomes like us!

But I, with only vegan teeth, no rope,

no cage, no gun, I made sure I did not go

to the lab. Though now I die,

I saw a little justice done.

CH'FPING BLOCK
See this stump, this stub, this late
Remainder of late life, this block

Where necks were stretched to separate

The serpent head from bloom and flock.

See this hen, she stands where blood
Is dfied and gone, where the ax bite
Has healed. She ruffles up her hood

And nods and blinks and dreams of flight.

,2”
/ WARNING THE DEER

Three weeks that include Thanksgiving
the hunters excuse themselves from reality
. and rationalize they are managing some
of the deer that would starve in the cold
for lack of browse. I’d sooner starve
any day than be annihilated
by a slug disintegrating my insides,
metal ﬁst from a black steel '
barrel, sighted in by a scope
on my privacy, murdered by some individual
working out what seems part
of that original sin the Bible
speaks about when Adam and Eve
got separated from all the animals they loved.

Imagine being a deer:

the winter is hard—aren’t

they always? all day we browse

in the zone of starvation

ambling quietly toward death
uncomfortably getting numb '

when you see us we look content
our pellets of waste diappear

as stomachs shrink

in the black and white

of snow and winter trees

in this northern existence we love
our spirits variations of ancestors
men drew on cave walls

in Eurasia when time began— A
there is nothing like lying down cold
and slowly draining self into

a burial mound of fur and frozen ﬂesh
within hearing of luscious spring

to become part of a carrion

crow, a touch of lynx but mostly
forest . ' . or: -
already it is time again

to hightail it

I heard the faint reports

this morning even before

the sun took the light from the stars.
There is the one sickly stench '

in my memory

so revolting I turn

both toward and away from it

at this time every year

for all of a sudden it is

everywhere _

and I listen for twigs breaking

like miniature explosions

heralding the arrival of my destroyer
in red woolens. .
There! Again! Even as I

take 03 I am turned

excruciatingly inside out anus to throat
shredded spleen and intestines

burst open by expanding

metal—my deemess.

On my way to work this ﬁrst Monday
of hunting season, I stop at a store
and as I am leaving after exchanging
pleasantries with the storekeeper,

she asks if I’ve gotten my deer.

I say I’ve yet to go out,

been busy making a living

closing the shell of a house in for winter.
As I drive away I am ashamed

I didn’t tell her the whole U'uth.

I’m not a hunter in this county

of hunters. I’ve been out

warning the deer; up on the rafters
with my hammer warning the deer.
Bang bang bang bang. One

two three four. Get going!

Now pounding nails again into the house frame,
I hope my echoes of warning

across the valleys and hills of Danville

are understood. Bucks move the docs

and the fawns into the bogs

and into the marshes and up

the mountains away from the atavistic

menace come hunting them here. Let

those people sight in their riﬂes

eternally, get the shakes drilling

cans off fences, and wonder how this year

.all the deer have disappeared. ' -' -' - .°_‘-_"

 




I.

The L.A. Times says:
bats have returned
to the San Gabriel
Valley. Attracted
by insects

and moist air,

they emerge

at dusk

from mountain caves
to swoop down

over the city.

One in twelve

is rabid.

II.

Mice with wings!

Mystical rodents!

There were thousands

in eastern Pennsylvania,

darting forth on summer evenings
from attic rafters

to slice the air

with their squeaking and sonar.

(stanza break)

 




Women covered their hair.
Men eyed the sky
anxiously. Children
were made to stay indoors

while the blue

air thickened with the scent

of small. furred bodies
floating on skin wings.

and searching for echoes.

They fed on mosquitoes,
but you never knew

for certain

whether the location
they picked up on

might not be your own.

Summer wasn't summer
unless a bat got in,
the whole house
woken into terror

by the kiss

of a clawed wingtip
across the face

of a sleeping

child.

(stanza break)

 




III.

Chased with brooms,
captured in pillowcases,
thriving on exterminators'
poison, the bats persisted,
not evil in themselves,

only Other, and dangerously

. em .
inconxient. A nightly,

reminder that what drifts
on dark wings

at the edge of sleep

is simply our own fear
escaping from attics

in search of something

like itself.

IV.

I once found an infant bat.

A wad of crumpled silk the color
of chocolate, it flopped

in the tall grass

at the very

edge of the meadow.

Squeaking and helpless,

it stared with sun-blinded eyes
into the length of my shadow.

I knew it could not See me.

(stanza break)

 




It was Sb small

I could have held it
in one palm.

But, fearing rabies,

I didn't; I called

to my mother who came

with a berry basket

and lifted the bat out

of the damp grass, taking
it to a place in the barn
where it might hang,

dark and peaceable again
among its fellows,
protecting it,

waiting for night to come.
