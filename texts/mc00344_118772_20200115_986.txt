[Humane Rules
F 01‘ Research

“On no other piece of legislation which I
have sponsored have ‘I received :so much mail,”
said a Tennessee Congressman recently. He re-
ferred to a bill~—one among many—to Secure
humane treatment of laeratory. animals.

His estimate of the public’s interest is sup-
ported by many other senators andtrepresenta-
tives, who find that When peopleback home
aren’t expressing concern about the Vietnam situ-

ation, they’ re likely to be worrying; about the
stealing of degs and cats and the treatmEnt of
these and other animals .‘used fer research.

. \

One of the most critical problems was brought
forcibly to public attention some weeks ago by
a shocking picture story in LIFE It has generated
an outraged demand that Something be done to
curb pet- -stea1ers and to regulate pet- -dealers.

Other reperts descrlbmg unnecessarily cruel -
treatment of animals in eXperimental laboratOries -

have stirred humane societies across the country
to press for federal controls in that area

So there are, broadly, three areas -;-- and sev- 1

eral similiar legislative proposals aimed at curb-
ing abuses in each area. 1

I

The firSt problem is “petnapping”-—

 

For one thlng, there is the undisputed fact '
that laboratory eXperiments using animals have."

' 'ness made profitable .er the unsChpulous by the 5

growing demands made upon dealers for labora- ,
,, tory animals. It has ’SpaWn‘ed an unspeakably in- V
humane racket in stolen dogs and cats, which
are bought by dealers for resale to the labs. A
' suitable bill (HRi9743) to make such theft a feds
' feral crime Was reported out of a House com-"‘

mittee last month. .1 ~ . 5.

This much, it seems likely the Congress will

be in a mood to pass Nobody has any leve for.
an enimal thief. And nobody exh1b1ts much sym- ‘-

pathy for the dealer who makes his llvmg furn-

7 ishing pets fer laboratorles. But in a third area _
where remedial legislation appears to be needed-
-- in the regulation of laboratory practices 1— the,

going is expected to be stlft'er ~ 1 ,

Butthere is a need for federal standards to
insure that animals usedifor‘legitimate research
by legitimate laboratories are not alloWed to suf-
fer needlessly Unquestionably at the present
time, many dogs, cats, monkeys mice and rabbits

,do.

'.

Fortunately, there is sound and carefully
drawn legislation in the mill that can rectify the
situation The Rogers'- McIntyre bill (introduced
in the House by Representative Paul Rogers of
Florida) is], intended, according toits title, “to pro-
vide for the best care, welfare and safeguards.
against suffering fer certain animals used for
scientific purposes without impeding necessary
research.” It is designated as HR 10049 and
S 2576.

Understandably, it is not being welcomed very
enthusiastiCally by many of the people operating

1 research facilities, who tend to believe that a law" .
. 1 to correct abusive laboratory practices and re-
a bnsi- 3

duce unneceSSary duplications“ 1n experimentation
will endanger their livelihood. ' '

But we are reminded that meatpackers Who '
once thought a humane slaughter law would ruin}
them havelong since recognized that it has made
their operations more efficient as well as humane.

'And since so much of\~the experimentation in

question is conducted with federal grants and [j

‘ " subsidies, it will be most appropriate as well as .
1 The related problem is the handlmg of ani- f

efficient to enact federal regulations to alleviate 1
the suffering of laboratory animals.

V The Pet’napitng Bi“

. THE BILL BANNING petnaping passed by the House
of Representatives seems to us to be a good com-
promise between two widely divergent, but legitimate
objectives. By requiring the licensing of, and the keep-
ing of adequate records by, both dealers and labora-
tories, the billjis a good guarantee to the pet owner that
his anl'maf will not be stolen for experimentation. And
;. rictions are moderate and limited to only
the typical pet animals—dogs and cats—the. measure
satisfies scientists that their legitimate scientific experi-
ments will not be burdened by unwieldy regulation.
That the bill finally approved was moderate in tone is
a credit to the good sense of House members. From the
beginning of debate, this measure was marked by un-
' usual emotional fervor generated in large part by some
: people of very extreme views. (One congressman said '
. he got more mail about this issue than about the whole
Viet Nam war.) Fortunately, neither extreme opinion
‘ was reflected in the approved resolution. ‘
5 On the one side were those favoring no regulation at
‘ all. Apparently this group did not realize the serious-
ness of the situation—the unvarnished cruelty to ani-
. mals—which has‘been plainly exposed by recent articles
~ in newspapers and national magazines. Inter-state
trafficking in animals, stolen and strayed, has increased
alarmingly in the last few years. And the loss of these
2 . prized pets, coupled with their inhumane treatment at.E
the hands of dealers interested only in turning the fast ,
. buck, plainly rquired national remedial action. .
At the other extreme were adherents to the rather
incredible view that absolutely no experiments on ani-
mals should be permitted. (Some of these people ﬂew
under the banner: of being “anti-vivisectionists,” despite
the fact that this reputable organization mainly seeks
only the humane treatment of animals subjected to
scientific experiment, and not an outright ban on animal
use at all.) ' _
It was unfortunate that this group, which would halt

The Petn‘opmg Bull
5’ The-bill banning p'etnapin’g‘ passed by
the Houseo‘f Representatives last Thurs-
day» seems to us to be a good compromise
between two widely divergent, but legiti-
mate objectives. By requiring the licens-
ing of, and the‘keeping of adequate rec-
' ordse' by, both dealers and laboratories,
the bill is good guarantee to the pet own-
erv'that his? animal will not be stolen for
experimentation. And because its restric-
. tions are moderate and limited to only
the typical 'pet animals-f—dogs and cats—w
t ,e ”measure satisfies’scientists that their
legitimate scientific experiments will not
bé‘burde'ned by unwieldy regulation.

. That the*bi11"*finally apprOVed was
_moderate in tone is a credit}? to the good
senseof Honse members. From the begin-
ning of debate, this measure Was marked
by unusual emOtional fervor generated in
large part by some peOple of very ex-
t’reme views. (One Congressman said he

got more mail, about this issue than-about
the whole Viet Nam war.) Fortunately,l

neither extreme opinion was reflected in
the approved resolution. ‘

Oh the one side Were those favoring:

' no regulation .at all.

group did not realize

the seriousnessbf

- From across the country in recent weeks there:
have been reports of dogs and cats being Stolen,
cften to be hauled Out Of the state for sale to re- ..
search laboratories. This isn’t just petty thievery,
some of it is evidently Well organized and on a large
scale; so much so that a bill has been proposed to;
make it a federal offense to transport stolen animaIS‘
across a State lin‘e = .- ‘ *
SuCh‘ legislation is really not necessary. Stealing?

:i‘s stealing, and there are already laws against that. ‘5
I Would be more concerned as to why there is such

a‘ big market fer these animals that it is proﬁtable

for pet thievery to become organized on such a big

scale. And at so happens that federal funds are pay-:
LL“...—

 

 

 

 

5 ing' for some of those stolen ammals, and not very
" indirectly . . 1 9
Here’s the way it Works: many hospltals, lab-'
oratories and universities reCeive federal grants to’
do reSearch which involves animals. In some cases
an animal “dealer” contracts to furnish animals to
one of these institutions and, in turn, looks for.
someone to furnish them to him 5. with no ques-
Itions asked as to where the creatures come from.-
Desplcable as those may be who would sell an-
imals in that fashion, I Wonder if they are really
any WOISe than some of the “resea c . ’who buy
them I agree that the us ‘of whine 3 1n medical~

Called :5,a “selence”, behavioral 1esearch consists
of putting an animal in a very small cage and sub
5 iectmg it to- var1ous “stimuli”, including electric
shock to test its reactiOns or to train it to do
certain things. '

:55 Some of this may be justiﬁed—this sort of
tralnmg was used for the monkey which preceded
our human astronauts into space. But I think there

' is need for Congress to look into some of the other
goings on in the name of “behavioral research”.

Protecting Animals

I By John C O’ Brien
_ Once again lCongress is con-
‘ Sidering legis ation to
humane treatment of “$111!

gmedical 'schools and research

laboratories In the last five,

years 29 proposals for reg‘ula?

111a-ls have been introduced but
~ none of theSe was brought t11'-

a vote.
Whether 01

that animalS are uSed for ex.
1 perimentation unnecessarily
f. and are often subjected to
needless Suffering or death

, Some of the preponents, not.

all ,- are anti-vivisectioniSts
who would ban altOgether the
use of animals in scientific
.IfreSearth. Others concede the
pvoprietv of such experimen-
tatiOn but insist that owners
1of nets should be protected

Iia'gainSt theft of their animals,

by dealers and that animals
used in ' experimentation
should be humanely treated.

Directors of medical. phar-
maceutical and ‘othc1 scien-
l tific research f01 the most part

to unnecessary pain or death

These friends of cats 'ahd dogs. .1

rabbit‘s.- guinea pigs, hamsters
and other species", it is ar
gued place thetwelfare of
animals abbve that of human
beings. For through experi-
mentation with animals discov-
erics have been made which
have alleviated human suffer-
int: and improved the health of
millions of human beings. I

“ Pharmaceutical 'Wpanies
also try out new rugs on
animals before deciding
iwhcthei‘ they Would be safe
er useful in the treatment of
human ailments Without such
experimentation with the
lower animals the drug man-
ufacturers insist, development

of new drugs wouldI be Ivir *

.tually impossible

Most of the advocates of the
humane treatment legislation
étdo not question the needifor
experimentatmn with animals1
but they challenge the claim“
f'h'of laboratory directors that

I not laboratory
*animals are' treated inhU'
}maner has always been a
matter of controversy. Those

the infliction of unnecessary
suffering is rare: They con-
cede that some research sci-
entists may have a tender re.
gard fer laboratory animals,
b11t. common sense dictates

that when between 200, 000 and

300, 000 persons are engaged

'in the use of animals in re- .

search and teaching, there are
thousands Who are callous and
‘cruel‘.

Several bills dealing with

the treatment of laboratoryI

animals are now before Con-
greSSmnal 1. committees T h e
one supported by the National
CathOlic Society for Animal

Welfare is concerned with the'
regulation of the transporta-‘

tlon, Sale and handling of ani
Mmals by dealers who sell to
laboratories.

Testifying recently in sup-

port of the bill, Helen E.
Jones, president of the Society.
pointed out that Owners of pets
have no protection against
dealers who steal cats and
dogs or capture strays. To put
an e'1nd to such unscrupulous
CIQndUCt she urged that dealers
be required to obtain a fed
eral license.

Such a licensing system is“

provided in a bill offered by
Rep Henry Helstoski of New

Jersey. His bill Would authOr- I

17.0 the Secretary of Agricul-

)ture to license all dealers in
They accuse advocates of hu- '

' ordinator to

also require a dealer to hold.

,any animal acquired by him

in any manner for five days ,
before disposing of it, So as ;I
to give owners of stolen or 2
strayed pets a chance to re- 1
cover them ‘

The' bill provides that ani-
mals used for yivisection by
students be first thoroughly
anesthetized and be humanely
put to death before regaining
consciousness. A force of in- -
Specltors from the Office, of
Animal Welfare would be
charged ,with the duty of mak
ing frequent inspections to
make sure that laboratory
animals were not used unnec-
essarily er subjected to un-
necessary pain.

A different objective is
sought in a bil introduced by
Rep. Claude P pper of Florida.
His bill provides for the regu-
lation of the use of animals
in laboratories. It empowers
the President to appoint a co-l
head an inde-
pendent Office of Animal Lab-
oratory Welfare in the Depart-
ment of Health, Education
and Welfare. The coordinator
would issue licenses to labora-
teries where animals are Med
for research if they received
United States grants or con-
tract funds or engaged in }n
terstate commerce

marily was responsible for en-
actrn‘ont of the 1960 humane
slaughter law, aided by Rep.
Poage.

It reportedly was at her re-
quest that Vice-President Hum-

Ho a 3 had the society for
medical reSearch to compro-
mise in its long stand against

The medical research Society

the provisions of the Poage bill,

The sister of 3 Warren wom-t

 

 

an, in view of the recently reor-.
gam‘zed W 1rren County Humane
Society, has called attention to
the fact that The New York

Times has editorially support-

ed passage of a. bill introduced
by Senator. Joseph\ S. Clark
(D. Pa.) and Rep James Cleve-
land, a New Hampshire Repub--
lican.

TllE EDITORIAL noted that
nearly two million dogs and
more than a half-million eats, -
plus a large number of rabbits,
monkeys and other animals
were used in medical research

. experiments in the United States
last year.

It was pointed out that most
people assume that laboratories
provide the animals with ade-
quate k g1 ood and
water and exercise space. Also
noted is the fa ct that while
some experiments are painful,
people believe no researcherit

would subject an animal to long
or extreme pain;

THE NEW York Times ar-
tiele charges that in many, if
not in most, cases none of these
condtions exist It is said that
animals are often‘kept' in cages
too small for them to turn
around 1 in comfortably; opporf 1
tunities for exercise do not ex-
is‘t; animals die of neglect or-J
are- left -to- linger for days in
shock. Lack of record keeping
leaves no check on the number
of experiments performed.

According to the editorial,
these conditions are not neces-
sary.'Pointed out is the fact that
British medical research, has
flourished ‘for nearly 90 ‘ years

.under a. legal code establishing

rational controls over animal

research: 1

ASSOCIATE Justice Abe For-
tas, before his Supreme Court
ap; ointnient, drafted a bill mod-
eled after the British law. Clark
atnd Cleveland have introduced

istration has taken no position,
most of the medical profession
is vehemently opposed and Con-
gress has not acted, ” says The
Times.

.Terming the Clark-Cleveland
bill a challenge to the American
,conscience, the editorial says

antivivisection is not at issue, power to expedite the passage
but decent, responsible care of of this bill as soon as Congress
dumb animals is. reconvenes. '

IT HAS BEEN suggested that The New Y01k state woman
those interested in humane who brought the telling editorial
treatment of animals write let- to local attention has also urged
ters to their representatives others in her hometown to sup-
and do anything else in their port the bill. . £14 -

The Editor
The Cincinnati Enquirer
Cincinnati, Ohio
Dear Sir:
Your thoughtful editorial of January 2rd has come to our attention, and we wish
to express appreciation for the genral 1:2:2h33xwhich you express. There are two
points, however, which call for comment: the first, on the humane slaughter law
passed in 1958. This law applies not only to meat purchased by governmental agencies,
but to all the animals in all the packing plants associated with any packer who
sells to any governmental agency. Thus more than 80% of the animals slaughtered
in the United States must be humanely slaughtered. State laws are required to
cover the nest.

With regadd to the question of licensing the directors of research laboroatories
as opposed to licensing of each scientist using animals, the first system is far
more open to abuse than the second. Presumably, the director is thnxmust one of the
most valuable of the scientists in any given institution, otherwise he would not have
been put in charge. Why, then, should his licesne be put in jeopardy for the misdeeds
of any member of the staff? Not only would b! it be unfair to stop him from doing
his research because some other person needed correcting, but it would be contrary to
the best interests of.American science to put the best men in a position to have their
work stopped through no fault of their own. The proper way to bring about responsible
treatment of experimental animals is for each scientist to have his own license, knowing
that it could be suspended or revoked should he ﬂziixtnxtrnzkxhixxxnimaix abuse his
animals. This system has worked with well for a ninety-year period in Great Britain
with the approval of the scientists working under its provisions (see enclosed statements
from the British Medical Journal and British Medical Association). Medical opposition
to the endangering of the careers of leading scientists through untested and hastily

conceived legislation is strong, and we agree with it. Because the British Act has

stood the test of time and is strongly supported by British scientists, the SAPL
supports the bills written by Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortes, based on the principles

of the British Act, 3. 1071 and H.R. 5647, the Clark-Cleveland bill. We believe that

SOCIETY FOR ANIMAL PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION
745 Fif’rh Avenue
New York 22. New York

Can you help to obtain a resolution of support for the
legislation to require humane treatment of laboratory animals?
Such resolutions are needed for presentation at Congressional
hearings.

At the next meeting of
we hope you will propose a resolution urging prompt enactment
of the companion bills, S. 1071, introduced in the United States
Senate by Senator Joseph S. Clark and co-sponsored by Senators
E. L. Bartlett, Harry F. Byrd, Edmund S. Muskie and Stephen M.
Young, and H.R. 5647, introduced in the United States House of

Representatives by Congressman James C. Cleveland. I enclose a
sample for your general guidance in drafting, but we hope you
will write a resolution in your own words.

Resolutions from organized groups can play an important
part in obtaining favorable action on S. 1071 and H.R. 5647.
The enclosed reprint gives additional information on the legis—
lation. If you would like further information or extra copies
of literature to distribute at the meeting, please let us know,
and it will be sent.

With appreciation of your humane interest, and looking

forward to hearing from you, I am

Sincerely yours,

Secretary

The Editor,
The Calumbus Sunday Dispatch,
Colﬁmbus, Ohio.

Dear Sir,

It was most encouraging to read yaur aditarial, “Legislation
with.a Heart"; which appeared in tha January 50, 1966, issua
of The Calumbus Sunday Diap&tch.

Sengreasman E. R. Paage, Chairman of the Livestock SHbcommittea
of the House ﬁommittee on Agriculture, hag acheduleé hearings
ﬁarch 7 and 8 on twalva billﬁ, including his awn H.R. 12488.

Tha ?oage bill would licensg animal dealers, set humane standards
for care 0f all species of animala on éealars' premiaeg and in
»laboratories, remova federal funés from 1&boratoria3 if thay
fill to eomply, and provi&e for ravccatian of dealers' licenaes
if they are found guilty of cruelty or theft.

We hOpe the Gongresa will act promptly and favorably on this
bill, which would aliminate vast amounts of needlgss ﬂuffering.
Your help in obtaining enactment 0f this measura will be
deeply appreciated.

Thgnk ycu for the excellent 8tat$m®n£ yau hage made.

SinCQraly,

Chriatine Stevena,
Secratary. ,

’SLUGGISH GOING — The word for Sen.
Robert Kennedy's participation in the anti-
dognapping campaign is “dilatory”. ~-
The dictionary says this means “inclined to
delay {or procrastinate; slow: tardy; not prompt
.. . -. e c
' And that's what happened in regard to the
petitions that Western New Yorkers showered 0:11
the senator through the medium of this column,”

-which distributed the petition forms and then -
coordinated and dispatched them in bulk.

But—better late than not at all, and in all
fairness to the senatoré—here is his latest word
on his activities in this crusade. This letter ar-i
rived two days after my May 16 column, which

praised Sen. Javits' enterprise in pushing for '
"‘meaningful legislation” to license all dog con-

centration camps and to require detailed records,
including the origin of all animals destined for
medical research. . ‘ ‘ -

MORALS, SCIENCE—Here is Sen. Kennedy’ a
letter:

“Dear Mrs. Matthews

“This' is to acknowledge receipt of your letters
11an April 1 and May 5, of the enclosed reprints
from your column, of the petitions, and of numer-

ous other petitions and letters questing legisla- .1‘ '
tion for the pmtectiW improper
handling, and from very much

regret that, due to the large volume of mail

which arrives at my office daily, there has been .,

this unfortunate delay in my reply. I hope you
_will accept my apologies.

“Humane treatment of animals is, of course,
a moral obligation of any civilized society. I
know you 'will agree, as well, that legitimate
scientific research is a process which we should.
encourage. Nevertheless, we must be 'concerned
for the treatment and Welfare 0f animals..

HOUSE ACTS-J‘I know you were happy to

As passed, the bill authorizes the Secretary of
Agriculture to issue licenses to dealers and re-
search facilities for the purchase or transport of.
dogs and cats in interstate commerce, to Specify
humane methods of identifying and tagging dogs
-..and- cats being transported, and to prescribe
humane standards to govern the transportation
and handling of dogs and cats by the dealers
but not by the research facilities. The bill also
requires dealers to keep records of all handling,
transportation, urchases and sales' of dogs and
cats. According to the bill, violations of the

. regulations could result in a $500-a daivj fine,.

indicate to him that he should continue to cir-
culate them further among the Buffalo area
representatives.

“Please be assured that, should legislation

She was 27 yeaisa away from the labor market,

raising a family 0f three sons,- now age 17,27

she had did not prove very helpful. Finally, after

knocking on many doors that didn’t open to her,

Cruei’ry to Animals”

 

 

3'? The arrest of a Baltimore dog dealer for operat—
ing what is des ribed as a “Dachau concentration
camp for am,” Should help to speed through this
session of Congress bills .to regulate the treatment},
of animals used in scientific research- .1 .

Laws are needed, not. only to assure humane
treatment but to establish standards for the hand-
ling and transportation of animals to be used in lab-
oratories There also should be stiffer penalties for"
those who steal pets to meet the demand. .

Organizations dedicated to animal protection say.
investigations disclOse needless suffering brought,
about by callous researchers. Dogs, they report, are
housed ”in dirty quarters, ill treated underfed and
‘ , subjected to cruel experiments without regard to pain.

' Denying such charges, scientists say the pending
bills are a threat to freedom of research. They admit
the need fer added construction and increased staffing
.‘of laboratory facilities, but insist that pain is in-
flicted only When necessary to adVance medical knowl-
edge '. be . .4 .

There must be some way of imposing restraints
on animal experimentation without impeding re-
searCh, and it is up to Congress to supply it. Mere
gestures in this direction have been made in the past,
but they are not nearly enough. Laboratory cruelty
must be curbed and penalties for the theft of pets for
researchers made so severe it will be discouraged.

This being the 100th anniversary of the Ameri-
'can Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ,
it Would be a fitting time for passage of such legis- i

lation ' , _ . . \i’

Dear Sir:

In the.ﬁpril 6th issue of‘igg Datroit ﬂaws; 3r. Rags V; Taylar untruth~
fully attacks lagislation to rayuirm humana traatmant 9f animals by
dealers and labaratorias. Thara is me passibla way that this lagisla~
tion cauld yravant the teaching 0? first aid er intayfare with amy'
teaching 9r rasaareh prmgram whatevar, and 3?. @ayler's atataments on
these mattars are both falaa and irraspansible.

.Animal suffaring in laboratories is both pralangad and aevera, and organ»
129d madicine has cansistantly fought avary effort by'tha Unitaé ﬁtataa
Cengress ta requira humane traatmwmt 9f the animals. Th3 suffering 0f

two dags at Wayne State ﬁniversity was $0 neiay that patiantﬁ in tha naigh~
boring hospital cauld not alaap; and Michigangs wut$tanding Haalth Cam~ ‘
missioner, Dr. Albert E. Haustis, teak deeisiva aatian by'putting gayne
State Univarsity on prcbation. 0thar needlasa animal suffaring in labm»
ratorias has likewige met with firm actimn by the Cmmmissimner, but no
other states are 80 fortunats. Should nut similar humane standards ha
enforced throughout cur Nation?

Dr. Heustis, in a latter tn the Bubeommittea Chairman, gtatad:

"we in Michigan wish to strongly rseammend tha merits 9f ¥
lieensing laboratorias far the humane use cf animals and

to assure the laboratories that no particular hardships
are involved.

"Michigan Act 241 Qf 19h7g with the rules and regulations
promulgatad thereundar, and the simpla applicatimn form

for regigtration to keep 0r has animal5 far the diagnosis
and treatment at human and animal diseases has baan'opern
ating in an efficient fashion far almost twanty'yaars. It
would certainly appaar to us that snub a law wmuld ba dasir~
able and would funation an a nationwida basis as effectively
as it has in Michigan.“ '

I trust your readers will recognize in these honagt statemantg haw unfair
and 111 founded ara tha chargas made by Dr. Taylmr. W9 urge all humans
citiaons to write to ﬁenator ?h111p A. Hart in suppart of S. 2322 and S. 3059.

OBSERVING
OBEDIENCE

Either you take a stand or you sit idly
by . . . I can not sit idly by.

Take a real close look at your pet . . .
you see an alert expression, ﬁrm body
properly exercised and nourished, shin-
ing coat you’ve well cared for, and be—
cause of frequent veterinarian Visits he
is free from diseases, ﬂeas and worms
. . . but elsewhere . you might ﬁnd
him with eyes dulled by abuse and pain,
ribs extended beneath a coat which
never felt a grooming tool, housed in a
cage where there is barely enough room
to stretch, and because he is now a
scientiﬁc animal he sees doctors quite
frequently . . however, they are more
interested in the experiments and how
much information and knowledge can be
obtained regardless of the condition of
the animal. ’

The Society For Animal Protective
Legislation needs your help as do all the
stolen mistreated animals . . NOW!!!
S u p p o r t t h e CLARK—CLEVELAND
BILL (S. 1071 and H.R. 5647) AND an
effective bill to stop theft and abuses in
the dog and cat trafﬁc to laboratories.

The “CLARK-CLEVELAND BILL” is
a challenge to the American Conscience.
Antivivisectio-n is not an issue, but decent,
responsible care of dumb animals is.

Please act now -— Write to your Sen-
ator and Congressman in support of
Animal Protective Legislation.

Latest news from Christine Stevens of
the Society is “scientiﬁc opposition” wants
to placate Congressional demands for
decent treatment of laboratory animals
by a so—called “Accreditation Scheme”
for animal—using laboratories. A group
called AAALAC (American Association
for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care) has been formed, and its their idea
to go around and accredit institutions for
a fee ranging from $100.00 to $1,000.00
(plus $100.00 per year). Accredited in-
stitutions would be all set for ﬁve years
Once they had passed a single inspection
by the group. They probably wouldn’t
have to worry much about the ﬁrst in-
spection (or “site visit,” as they prefer
to call it) since a number of members of
the council who are scheduled to do the
visits and make the decisions are heads
of laboratory animal units which are in
desperate need of reform. Some mem-
bers of this council themselves permit
hosing of cages with the dogs inside, re-
fuse to give pain-relieving drugs to an-
imals after major surgery, frequently
fail to keep premises cleaned daily or to
provide fresh water to all the animals. In

short, what scientiﬁc opponents to hu-
mane legislation have in mind is a na-
tionwide whitewashing operation, and
they are hard at work now promoting it.

Pharmaceutical companies are playing
host to spokesmen for AAALAC who are
prophesying that the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare will in-
troduce a bill which would place reliance
on voluntary accreditation.

You can write to the President, The
White House, Washington, DC. and
again to the Senators and Congressmen
asking them to oppose this shameful pro-
posal for sliencing just criticism of mis-
treatment of experimental animals. Our
President cannot read individual mail
but his intelligent aides can inform him
of its contents. He should know that
humane citizens want genuine mandatory
legislation to control laboratory cruelty,

legislation which provides for the licens-
ing of each scientist Who uses animals,
for unannounced inspection by qualiﬁed

government inspectors, and limitations
of pain so that animals cannot be tor-
tured and must be painlessly put out of
their misery as soon as the experiments
are over. When writing request your
letter not be referred to the National

Now to report on the Obedience Trials.

Only show in report this issue is the
Canton-McKinley Show and Trial held
January 16th. Highest Scoring Collie
was Paul A. Cook’s Pauley’s Sable Beauty,
C.D. (Shan of Westhaven ex Chanshire’s
Miss Candy) who in a run off with a
Border Collie took ﬁrst place with a
score of 19 3% plus in the Open Class A
under judge Dr. J. W. Dixon, Jr. I under-
stand this pair worked fast and smartly
completely through the exercises. High—
est Scoring Sheltie was Barbara Hoch-
stelter’s Badgerton DeLovely, U.D. who
scored a 198 and a second placing in
the Open Class B under Mr. John L.
Sinclair, Jr. “Ginger” is by Ch. Thistle-
rose Perfection ex Ch. Badgerton Panto-
mime Patsy. Other scores were earned
by Naomi Laughbaum’s Sheltie Sue’s
Royal Robyn, C.D.X. who score-d a 172
and secured his ﬁrst leg in Utility work
under Dr. Dixon.

Because I missed the score of one
Collie I called the owners who lived
nearby and made a new friend. Mrs.
Robert W. HefHey who lives in Kent,
Ohio told me of their teenage son “Bud-
dy” more formally known as Robert W.
Heﬂley, Jr. training and handling his
Parview’s Golden Mike (Kingswood’s
Golden Mark ex Jim’s Golden Girl),
Collie, to his Companion Dog Degree in
four straight shows with scores of 177-
189-18735. “Buddy” also has shown
“Mike” in Novice B Junior Handling and
at Warren, Ohio in the summer of 1965
won ﬁrst place. When you read of all

the teenagers who are in trouble all of
their lives isn’t it a relief to hear that
those who have the opportunity to work
with animals always seem to keep on the
straight and narrow and enjoy it. Gon—
gratulations Buddy and Mike and to the
whole He-fHey family.

The accomplishment of ﬁnishing our
ﬁrst homebred champion is still fresh. A
little sable and white Sheltie now Ch.
Kerrylance Silk Stockings ﬁnished in De—
cember with four majors and seven Best
Opposite Sex placements. She was so
good that I’m a bit hesitant about tak-
ing her replacement out known as Kerry-
lance Supermulygorjus. Thank you all
for the very nice cards and notes express-
ing congratulations; they were all ap-
preciated and saved.

A letter arrived in yesterday’s mail
asking about the value of reading books
on obedience training. I never read any
books on obedience training when I was
training and exhibiting “Zemmy,” “Baw-
dy” and “Tinker” . . . so I went out and
picked up Winifred G. Strickland’s Ex-
pert Obedience Training for Dogs. In
one night I read the entire book com-
pletely and was very impressed. What I
now plan to do is take a six month old
male and faithfully follow all of Mrs.
Strickland’s advice and see if the results
are any different.

In Mrs. Strickland’s book she states
that if all is followed right down the line
that by the fourth month of training you
can take your dog to the Sanction Match
and if he shows that he is ready on to
the Point Shows. By the eighth month
you should be able to compete in Open
for the C.D.X. degree and at the 11th
and 12th weeks you should be able to
enter Utility Work if you are conﬁdent
in your dog.

I personally like the way she writes
and stresses the need of voice control,
praise, constant praise and patience. And
believe that she is well versed to write
on obedience having had three German
Shepherds bring home the Top Obedience
Dog Awards from 1950 through 1954 and
in 1952 and 1954 having the Runner-up
dog. Please do add this book to your
dog library.

to do for any speciﬁc bitch. When I don’t
get my questions answered, it leaves me
wondering if perhaps the dog’s owners
are afraid to answer them. It is my feel-
ing that anyone who advertises a dog at
stud are offering something ‘for sale,’ and
they owe at least common courtesy to the
prospective purchasers of the services
they have to sell. I realize that many of
these people are very busy — but if they
are too busy to answer a couple of ques—
tions (they don’t need to write a com—
plete dissertation), I then wonder if
they are too busy to care for my bitch
properly should I ship her to them. And
here I am writing a column myself —”

Those ever—faithful New Orleanians in-
form me of some litter news. Dot Gerth
has two promising show pups from Gerth—
stone’s Seventh Son ex Gerthstone’s Molly
Malone, and they shall be called Blue
Bear and Black Bear which clearly in—
dicates their color. Emily Boyd has bred
her Gonsipartour daughter (whose name
I do not have) to Ch. Socrates of Gerth—
stone, and writes that the litter is ex—
tremely uniform and packed with quality.

Billy and Betty Crawford of Midland,
Texas are now Louisianians and they
have a nine—month-old blue male by
their Ch. Celestial Tor. Linda Young’s
Gerth’s Captain of Younghaven now has
three majors, 18 points, at 10 months.

Word from Georgia way reveals that
the Walter Hoods have a little sparkler
of a bitch from their Parader’s Peaches
n’ Cream, and I believe that she was
bred to Parader’s Bold Commander. If I
am wrong, I shall correct it next column

. as occasionally my memory deserts
me.

See you in Columbus!

This column is being done by remote
control. While driving along Route 66
on the way to the St. Louis Collie Club
Specialty. Nice work if you can get it
that is. Having a back seat driver with
pencil and paper and a willingness to
leave the driving to me.

For a change the weather is nice, snow
all gone and roads dry as a bone.

A fleeting thought one day, of no
awards being handed out at the Central
States Collie Club annual diinner held
after the Specialty Show on April 16,
1966. Then John and Jo Affeld up and
finished Patriciane’s Whiggamor Wiggin
at the Wheaton Kennel Club Show on
January 16, 1966 under “Doc” Great-
house, giving her her fourth major win
and the necessary points to enable her
to use the word “Champion” in front of
her name. For Winners Dog it was
Berkdale’s Dark Warrior, owned by the
Berkers. For Best of Variety “Doc” chose
the ever-popular Ch. The Clown Prince
of F loravale, owned by George and Chriss
Schroder. “Rowdy” went on to place
Third in Group under Earle Adair. Col-
lie entry was 85.

A very nice blue making himself well
known in the ring is Doral Blue Dynamic,
owned by Albert and Dorothy Krueger
who took the points under Dr. Milton
Barman at Wisconsin Kennel Club Show
on January 80, 1966. Even by being a
very crowded with “no room to move”
show, still it draws more exhibitors
every year. It was three points in each
sex this year with an entry of 60. Also
a nice win for Carol Betlach and Pegasa’s
Proud Promenade. Ch. F loravale Perfect
Gentleman topped the breed and then
went on to place Third in the Working
Group under judge Robert Waters. Ab-
sent form the Milwaukee show were sev-
eral Collie exhibitors. The Crotteaus
WERE in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Susan
Crotteau was passing judgement on 40
puppies entered in the Collie Club of
Southern Ohio Specialty. First in the
Sweeps went to Vivian Ja Baay with a
darling tri bitch who shall be nameless
until we ﬁnd out her name from her
owner. For the regular classes Ada Shir-

ley was present and chose as her Best of
Breed Ch. The Clown Prince of F lora-
vale, owned by the Schroeders. Here the
entry was 105. If “Rowdy” is following
his pattern of 1965 —- we shall see him
as “Best in the Midwest” again in ’66.
The Affelds brought home a few lovely
trOphies won by their Whiggamor
VVhoopee and Whiggamor Waltzaway.

The James Rostrons of Wraggle Taggle
Collies in Morton Grove, Illinois were
very thrilled with their Whiggamor My
Gal Sal at Muncie, Indiana. She came
out with a three—point major under judge
Oren Kem. The Rostrons are fairly new
to the show ring. Before purchasing a
Collie and entering the ring they at-
tended club meetings, puppy matches
and dog shows to study and learn. A nice
win for a very deserving couple.

From the Glen Oaks Collies and Cass
and Mary Collins of Hampshire, Illinois
we have the report of a litter of seven,
ﬁve blues and two tris, sired by Ch.
Vikingsholm Vagabond from Glen Oaks
Bluesy.

From the Winterset Collies and Jim
and Joan Winters of Winfield, Illinois
we have a report of a litter of seven,
five blues and two tris from Ch. Marnus
Silver Dollar from Vikingsholm Vanette.

From the Brandbrook Collies and Phil
and Martha Brand we have the report of
a litter of nine, seven blues and two tris
by Ch. Vikingsholm Vagabond from Mis-
chief of Brandbrook.

Me thinks we will be having some fair
sized blue classes in a year or so.

From the Illiana Collie Fanciers. At
the January 28, 1966 meeting plans were

being made for the Second Sanction A
Match to be held in Munster, Indiana on
April 24, 1966. For information please
write the Show Secretary, Eleanor Klim-
ek, 215 Calumet Boulevard, Harvey,
Illinois.

At the Central States Collie Club meet-
ing on February 11, 1966 there were six
new members accepted. They are: Tome
and Jean Keating of Belvedere, Illinois;
Larry Reynolds, Glenview, Illinois; Ar—
lene Fraser, Lockport, Illinois; and Lee
and Bernadene Harris of Des Plaines.
Congratulations.

After the meeting a champagne and
barbecue party was given for Ch. Pa—
triciane Whiggamor Wiggin. Over 30
members stayed and drank a toast to the
proud owners — John and Jo Affeld.

From the Milestone Collies and Joyce
Miles of Pana, Illinois comes a nice
newsy letter. Seems as if Milestone’s Miss
Moneybags is living up to her name by
producing 22 living puppies in two lit-
ters. The latest litter was sired by Bello—
chanty Honey Bear. They are keeping a
bitch puppy from the last litter with high
hopes of breeding and later possibly
showing her.‘ She will be named Mile-
stone’s Millionairess. She is their third
generation. Another half-sister, Mile-
stone’s Mirage, is due to whelp a litter
in March sired by Milestone’s Marengo
who is by Can. Ch. Alandale F ullﬁllment.
These people are hoping to produce the
beautiful show Collie but also to pre-
serve the intelligence and natural work—
ing ability of the old-time Collie.

out that other groups have been con-
sidering its possibilities for monitoring
the physical condition of space voy-
agers. “All that would be needed is a
saliva collector and an autoanalyzer”
(MWN, May 22, ’64). Saliva studies
are also being used in monitoring
hemodialysis.

Among systemic conditions, the in-
vestigators’ chief interests so far have
been cystic ﬁbrosis, hypertension, and
Parkinson’s disease. Dr. Mandel says
that other laboratories have performed
tests similar to his on cystic ﬁbrosis
patients, “with varied results.” While
the weight of evidence is that there are
differences in the submaxillary secre-
tions of CF patients and normal con-
trols, the picture is not clear in regard
to parotid secretions.

“Calcium and phosphorus levels in
the submaxillary saliva of CF patients
may have diagnostic signiﬁcance,” Dr.
Mandel says. “But what is even more
important, the investigations may lead
to new ideas on the nature of the dis-
ease. We are beginning to correlate
our ﬁndings with the pathologic con-
dition of the glands themselves. Fur-
thermore, we plan to use the electron
microscope to look for relationships
between glandular structure and the
composition and ﬂow of saliva in cystic
ﬁbrosis and other diseases. And ﬁnally
we are learning more about the normal
salivary gland.”

Taste for Salt Affected

The study of hypertension, carried
out by Drs. Mandel and Steven Wot-
man of the dental school’s laboratory
for clinical research, in collaboration
with the department of medicine at the
College of Physicians and Surgeons,
has led to the curious discovery that
people with hypertension have greater
difﬁculty tasting salt, have reduced sa-
liva ﬂow, and less sodium in their sa-
liva. This might be a reﬂection of a
different salivary composition, Dr.
Mandel says, although the lower so-
dium content may simply be a result
of the reduced ﬂow rate. He suggests
that further work on the analysis of
saliva in hypertension could help de-
termine the cause of the condition.

The Columbia researchers have re-
cently begun studying saliva in Park-
inson’s disease, and they also plan to
study it in relation to abnormalities of

MEDICAL WORLD NEWS/April 15, 1966

thyroid, parathyroid, and other endo-
crine functions. A major portion of
their work is in relating saliva ﬂow and
composition to the formation of caries
and calculi.

Other investigators working with
saliva express the view that the most
exciting prospect in this ﬁeld is the
knowledge it may add to basic physi-
ology. Dr. Arthur Ellison of the State
University of New York School of
Dentistry at Buffalo cites a recent
study which shows that the protein
composition of saliva is affected by the
type of stimulus used to induce the
ﬂow. He suggests that once this phe-
nomenon is fully understood, a great
deal may be revealed about the mecha-
nisms of all of the exocrine secretions.

In a report on the clinical applica-
tions of disk electrophoresis of saliva,

Dr. Caldwell and his associates
have analyzed saliva from patients
with acute infections, carcinomas, cir—
culatory disorders, cystic ﬁbrosis, dia-
betes, hormonal imbalances, hypopro-
teinemia, hyperkeratosis, and Paget’s
disease. While differences in protein
proportions were observed, they
“didn’t make much sense to us because
we didn’t really know enough about
normal saliva. So we are now trying
to understand normal patterns of pro—
tein variations in healthy people.”

The Alabama investigator believes
that any disease that changes the con-
tent of gamma globulin in the blood
will be picked up in saliva. Diseases of
the salivary glands themselves can also
be detected. He suggests that saliva
tests be used for genetic studies, since
isoenzyme patterns may be reﬂected in

Specimen is analyzed for electrolytes, using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer.

Dr. Robert C. Caldwell of the Univer-
sity of Alabama School of Dentistry
notes that saliva contains serum pro-
teins, as well as those originating in the
salivary gland. Electrophoresis has
been used to separate these proteins
and measure their concentrations.
Such a technique could be of diagnos-
tic value, he suggests, once the normal
patterns of variation are known.
“Our new methods are so sensi-
tive,” Dr. Caldwell says, “that we can
now collect saliva on a cotton pellet as
it comes out of the duct opening, and
have enough for a protein proﬁle.”

the secretion. “As a body ﬂuid for clin-
ical analysis, saliva has a number of
advantages over blood because of its
accessibility. In patients with hemo-
philia, for example, the advantage is
obvious. It should also be useful in
pediatric practice, since children are
often frightened of having blood sam-
ples drawn.” And, he says, the effects
of drugs could be conveniently studied
by analyzing salivary changes.

“Four years ago, we thought there
were only ten or 12 proteins in saliva.
Now we know of over 20, and there
may be many more.” I

 




‘DOGNAPPING’ BILLS WIN FRIEND

Public pressure for some‘ sort of federal control over
the handling of animals used in medical research has
mounted rapidly in recent months. Widespread public-
ity has been given to the horrors perpetrated by some
dealers who sell dogs and cats to research institutions.
As a result, dozens of bills aimed at regulating the traf-
ﬁc in animals piled up in Congress.

The problem, from the point of View of the scientiﬁc
community, is to obtain a law that will bring about nec-
essary reforms without imposing the kind of restrictive
government controls that might cripple laboratory re-
search (MWN, Feb. 11). The number of bills has been
cut to two, both aimed basically at curbing the theft of
dogs and cats for research, and ensuring their humane
handling by wholesalers.

The National Society for Medical Research, found-
ed to educate the public on the methods and needs of
medical research, has endorsed the pair of bills as a
practical compromise. But even though the new meas—
ures deal primarily with animal handling, rather than
with the controversial matter of government control
over research laboratories, the American Heart Asso-
ciation and some other segments of the scientiﬁc com-
munity still see the legislation as a threat to the progress
of medical research.

 

Dealers and Their Customers To Be Licensed

All the “dognapping” bills basically call for the
Secretary of Agriculture to license dealers who buy or
sell dogs and cats for research and to license the institu-
tions that use them. The Secretary will also be empow—
ered to set standards for the care and handling of these
animals by dealers and laboratories, to require appro-
priate record keeping, and to provide for the imposition
of penalties on violators.

Passage of a law containing no controls over labora-
tories, except the requirement that they buy only from
licensed dealers, appears certain this year. The Senate
bill was proposed by Sen. Warren G. Magnuson (D-
Wash.). Under the glare of TV lights in a jammed Sen-
ate hearing on dognapping legislation, Dr. Maurice B.
Visscher, president of the National Society for Medical
Research, told Senator Magnuson that, with some
minor changes, medical scientists could live with the
bill. The society had already endorsed an amended ver-
sion of the House bill that had been introduced by Rep.
W. R. Poage (D—Tex.).

FEW ‘HEALTHY’ LUNGS
DEVELOP CANCER

y the time radiologists ﬁnd evidence
of lung cancer, it is usually too late
for a cure, says Dr. Katharine R.
Boucot, chairman of the department
of preventive medicine at Woman’s
Medical College of Pennsylvania.

Dr. Boucot’s opinion is based on
her experience as director of the Phila—
delphia Pulmonary Neoplasm Re-
search Project, set up to study the
problem of early detection of lung can-
cer. Her preliminary report to the an-
nual Science Writers’ Seminar of the
American Cancer Society focused on
90 histologically proved lung cancers
detected radiologically among 6,137
men 45 years of age and older during
a ten-year study period.

Perhaps the most important ﬁnd-
ing, she says, is that malignancy rarely
develops in healthy lungs. “Prevention
of respiratory diseases would reduce
lung scars, which preceded lung cancer
in almost half our cases.”

The Philadelphia researcher meas-
ured the length of time between chest
x-rays which revealed the ﬁrst abnor—
mality due to cancer, and prior ﬁlms in
which no tumor was visible. By corre—
lating this interval with the subsequent
course of the cancer, she believes she
has uncovered some fundamental as—
pects of the disease’s development.

Fast- vs Slow-growing Cancers

Some cancers, particularly squa-
mous cell and adenocarcinomas, grow
more slowly than others, she ﬁnds, and
patients with slow-growing cancers
seem to do better than others. Patients
with fast-growing cancers feel discom-
fort sooner, seek help sooner, and do
poorly. Six of eight men whose cancers
appeared within 5.25 months of a
“negative” chest ﬁlm had surgery.
This group had a mean survival time
of 8.9 months. The mean survival time
for those whose cancers appeared 5 .25
to 6.75 months after a negative ﬁlm
was 17.6 months. And when the tumor
was visualized seven to 12 months
after a negative ﬁlm, the mean survival
time was 20.1 months.

“We hypothesize that men whose
tumors were detected in 5.25 to 12
months of a negative ﬁlm had slower-
growing neoplasms, which gave rise to
little discomfort.” Concentrating on
41 men in this category, Dr. Boucot
says 18, or 44%, were resected, and
mean survival time among the 18 was
25.2 months. However, 15 of the 18
resected cases had squamous cell or
adenocarcinoma, “tissue types known
to have a better prognosis than undif-
ferentiated carcinoma of the lung,
which is almost uniformly fatal,
whether or not it is resected.”

Seven of the 23 cases that were
not resected “permit the best study of
the natural history of lung cancer, both
because of the frequency with which
chest X-rays were taken and because
the course of the disease could not
have been affected by exploration.”

1 Iflhadlungcancer ,V V

Four of the cases were squamous cell
carcinoma, and there was one case
each of bronchiolar, mixed, and un-
determined cancer. Mean survival
time for these seven men was 25
months, about the same as for the men
whose tumors were resected.

Dr. Boucot feels new methods of
detection are urgently needed. She sug-
gests that researchers investigate the
possibility of skin or serum tests, or
other methods utilizing radioactive
trace elements. “These tests might not
be feasible for large populations, but
they could be used on high-risk groups
—-—especially coughing smokers.” I

 

New Solutior

Relief for patients with diseases such
as cystic ﬁbrosis and colitis,
marked by the production of exces-
sive mucin, is promised by the dis-
covery in Canada of a group of muco-
lytic amides. The amides were given to
32 patients with disorders of this type,
and each of the patients showed im—
mediate improvement following a
single treatment.

Dr. Deirdre Waldron Edward of
McGill University’s Gastro—Intestinal
Research Laboratory in Montreal dis-
covered the mucin-dissolving acid
amides, which her associates call
the Waldron group. Because they dis-
solve mucins rather than denature
them, these new compounds also open
the way to new biochemical and physi-
ological studies of mucin.

The clinical and chemical value of
the amides is inestimable, according
to Dr. Stanley C. Skoryna, director of
the laboratory, who carried out the
clinical studies. He points out that the
only agents now available are mucoly-
tic enzymes and cysteine compounds.
The enzymes digest mucin, making
analysis impossible, and they have the
added disadvantage of affecting the
epithelium in many cases. The cysteine
compounds, he says, are simply not
very effective.

The new compounds are not only
more strongly mucolytic than the ear-
lier agents, but they are also nontoxic,
Dr. Skoryna says. A 20% solution of
the compounds in water or saline was
given over a four-to-six-week period
through standard nebulizers, the Bird
respirator, or ultrasonic nebulizers,
with no adverse effects. The patients
in the study were being treated for
chronic bronchitis, cystic ﬁbrosis,
asthma, bronchiectasis, emphysema,
and colitis.

The Montreal physician reports that
results were uniformly excellent, and
that there was an immediate change in
the viscosity of the bronchial secretion
in all cases. Although there was a posi-

 




At House hearing, medical group

N CONGRESS supports compromise legislation

of standards for animal care by dealers and labora-
tories. The stiff penalties provided for violators included
the cutting off of federal research funds. Sen. Hugh
Scott (R-Pa.) introduced a parallel bill in the Senate.

The American Heart Association had registered its
“strong opposition” to these and other measures that
stressed strict governmental control over laboratories.
The present House bill applies only to dogs and cats and
has eliminated provisions for laboratory care standards.

Commission To Advise Secretary

Modiﬁcations in the Poage bill have been “bene-
ﬁcial,” concedes AHA President Helen B. Taussig,
Johns Hopkins pediatrician. She urges, however, that if
control of medical institutions must be subject to the
Secretary of Agriculture, a 15-member commission be
established to guide the Secretary in making rules and
regulations.

The heart association is “militantly opposed to ani-
mal stealing for any reason,” Dr. Taussig notes, but it
feels that careful consideration should be given to all as—
pects of a new bill. Association officials are calling on
the membership to urge Congress to postpone consid-
eration of both the Poage and the Magnuson bills until
the humane animal care proposal formulated by the
Administration can be introduced in Congress.

The Department éf Health’ Educatlon’ and Wleare Dr. Taussig leads American Heart Association

THE INTELLECTUAL

v

AND EMbTIONAL WORLD
OF THE COCKROACH

Why manhas much to learn from the most adaptable if least-loved
species on earth. A report by a witty biologist.

Ever since archy stopped jumping on the keys
of Don Marquis’ typewriter in the ofﬁcesof the
New York San, cockroaches have passed from the
ken of most of us. It is a pity. Ours is a world of
insecticides, rodenticides, herbicides, and etcetia
cides. As archy complained, on reading an adver-
tisement for a roach exterminator:

the human race little knows
all the sadness it
causes in the insect world . . ."'

Of course, a biologist will tell you that insects
are unlikely to experience sadness. But the human
species is bereaved when it is unable to appreciate
the world of small and creeping things. I heartily
recommend cockroaches. Unlike archy, the average
roach has little or no poetry in his soul. But he is a
marvelous beast nonetheless. He must, of course,
be met on his own terms, in his own world. He has
been inhabiting that world successfully for some-
what more than 250 million years. The earliest
fossil cockroaches look so much like. contemporary
species that one can almost imagine them freshly
crushed by some irate housewife. But the ﬁrst
housewife was still more than 249 million years in
the future. Any creature so adept at survival would
seem to be worth our attention; survival is a sub-
ject we can stand to learn a lot more about.

Cockroaches are primarily creatures of the
tropics and subtropics; in temperate regions we
know them mainly from a few species that have
found an easy living in our homes, stores, and
restaurants. These domestic species include among
others the American, German, Oriental, Surinam,

and Cuban cockroach (a house my family once
rented in Florida was a veritable United Nations
of roachdom). A few years ago a cockroach was
served to me in an order of beefsteak and onions
in Texas (I believe it was American, but accurate
identiﬁcation of fried specimens is difﬁcult). I was
ravenously hungry after a day in the desert, so
I ate everything except the cockroach, which I
spread out neatly in the center of the empty plate,
arranging his antennae and legs as best I could.
The expression on the waiter’s face when he
cleared the table was ample compensation for the

. health risk I took. Although cockroaches are

basically clean animals, they do track about a good
deal of human ﬁlth; some carry bacteria respon-
sible for various intestinal disorders, as well as
polio virus and even hookworm.

The names of our domestic roaches are largely
the result of chance. When the Swedish naturalist
Linnaeus received a roach from America he called
it americana, while a roach from Asia he called
orientalis. Even by that time (1758) most domes-
tic cockroaches had spread over much of the globe,
and modern transportation has ﬁnished the job.
The late James A. G. Rehn, of the Academy of
Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, revealed that the
American roach and its close relative the Austra-
lian roach belong to a group which occurs in the
wild, primarily in tropical Africa. He felt that
these species, along with the Madeira roach and
several others, came to America at an early date on
slave ships. The Oriental roach also has wild rela-
tives in Africa, but it arrived in Europe very long
ago, perhaps on Phoenician vessels. Later it ap-
parently traveled to South America on Spanish
galleons and to North America on English ships.

The German roach, according to Rehn, came
from North Africa. As it spread across Europe it
was called the “Prussian roach” by the Russians,
the “Russian roach” by the Prussians, thus paral-
leling the history of syphilis, which was known as
the “French disease” t} roughout-much of Europe,
but as the “Italian disease” in France. The ﬁrst
outbreak of syphilis in the British colonies, by the
way, occurred in Boston twenty-six years after the
landing of the Mayﬂower. Evidently that noble

doubt, the German roach, long an inhabitant of
Boston slums but now ﬁghting a rearguard action

rived brown-banded cockroach.

America does, of course, have native roaches,
but few of them have become domesticated, per-
haps a reﬂection of the fact that man himself had
his origins in Africa, thus giving the African
roaches a big head start. The so-called Surinam
roach apparently did not come originally from that
Dutch colony in South America; Rehn found its
closest relatives in the Orient, whence the species
apparently spread into Africa and then joined
several other species in slave ships traveling to
that brave new world, America. Only one species,
the so-called pale-bordered cockroach, has reversed
the usual direction of immigration (may I say
encroachment?) and reached the Canary Islands
from its home in the West Indies.

Biologists are always on the lookout for animals
easy to rear in the laboratory, and what could be
easier than cockroaches, which are usually there
to start with anyway. Most species require no
more than a warm and cozy cage, a little water,

52 THE WORLD OF THE COCKROACH

regularly headed for the dark compartment. How-
ever, when he wired it in such a way that they re-
ceived an electric shock upon entering, they soon
learned to go straight into the lighted compart-
ment. (The males, he found, learned somewhat
more quickly than the females.)

Turner also taught his cockroaches to run mazes
successfully, a trick few insects can master. He
rigged up a complex pattern of pathways made
of copper strips supported over a pan of water.
At the end of one runway was an inclined plane
leading to the jelly glass that was “home” to that
particular roach. After only ﬁve or six trials at
half-hour intervals, most roaches reached their
jars faster and faster and made fewer errors en
route. In the course of a day the number of errors
declined to almost zero. Turner’s Oriental roaches
had short memories and had to be retrained every
day, but another worker found that American
roaches remembered and even improved from day
to day. Another researcher tried running two or
three roaches together to see if they could solve
a maze more rapidly in company—as certain ﬁshes
can. Exactly the opposite occurred. Apparently
extracurricular distractions conﬂict with serious
training even among roaches.

Lest anyone be inclined to dub the roaches
“eggheads,” I hasten to add that roaches without
their heads are able to learn some things well.
Recently Professor G. A. Horridge, of St. AndreWs
University in Scotland, arranged a decapitated
roach in such a way that the legs received electric
shocks every time they fell below a certain level.
After about thirty minutes the roach changed its
behavior in such a way that the legs were raised
and few shocks were received. A decapitated
roach, by the way, often lives for several days,
although it eventually starves to death.

The Mechanics of Cowardice

Doubtless the learning abilities of roaches have
something to do with their success in putting up
with the shenanigans of mankind. Other reasons
for their success are to be found in their ability
to scuttle off rapidly into crevices where they re-
main remarkably alert to peril. The roach’s alarm
system consists of long and active antennae on his
head, and a pair of similar but shorter structures
at the other end of the body, called cerci (from the
Greek word for tails). These cerci are highly
sensitive structures, and a light puff of air directed
at one Will send the roach scurrying. The cerci are
covered with tiny hairs that bend when a current
of air strikes them. Deﬂection of the hairs stimu-

lates some of the many nerves in the cerci, which
send a message to two clusters of nerve cells at
their base. Here the message is transferred to
giant ﬁbers many times larger than ordinary nerve
ﬁbers, which carry nerve impulses more than ten
times as fast as ordinary nerves (the rate is more
than 15 feet per second which means that an im-
pulse can traverse a giant ﬁber of the American
roach in less than .003 seconds). These ﬁbers carry
the impulse directly to the nerves and muscles of
the legs and produce the immediate escape re—
sponse so characteristic of roaches.

To study the evasive behavior of the cockroach
Professor Kenneth Roeder of Tufts University
rigged up a treadmill attached to a very sensitive
recording device. Behind the roach on the tread-
mill, he placed a small tube through which a jet
of air could be blown at the cerci. At the same
time the air jet would strike a small paper ﬂag,
also connected to the recording device, such that
the interval between air jet and leg movement was
registered. The cockroaches were fairly uncoop-
erative, as experimental animals often are, and
frequently cleaned themselves or made other un-
scheduled movements. But eventually Roeder ob-
tained twenty-three good measurements which
averaged out to about .05 seconds from air puff to
leg movements. In subsequent experiments he
found out why, although transmission over the
giant ﬁbers requires only about .003 seconds, an-
other .047 seconds, more or less, are required for
the ﬁnal response. Some of the difference was
caused by “synaptic delays,” that is, the time taken
for the impulse to cross from one nerve to another.

Synapses are the switchboards of the nervous
system and provide the major means of sorting
and directing messages. They do slow things
down. Because giant ﬁbers bypass many synapses,
they speed up the response. A number of ordinary
nerve ﬁbers might handle more information than
one giant ﬁber but at the cost of several thou~
sandths of a second. In the course of evolution, this
small gain in speed of escape from enemies out-
weighed the importance of carrying more detailed
messages.

Our own human warning systems operate on
much the same principle: emphasis is on rapid
transmission of simple messages (“missile ap-
proaching”) rather than much slower transmis-
sion of analytical reports. Such a system may have
enhanced the survival of roaches as a group by
millions of years, for their response is quick es-
cape, and if the source of stimulation is in fact
harmless, nothing is lost. Our problem, since we
have no place to escape to, is to avoid an inappro-
priate response to meaningless information.

 




In addition to their gift for speedy retreat some
roaches have developed effective defense mecha-
nisms. They can spray would-be predators with
repellent chemicals. Dr. Thomas Eisner of Cornell
University has found that one spray-known as a
quinone—caused attacking ants and beetles to re-
treat and to undergo “a series of abnormal sei-
zures, during which leg movements became dis-
coordinated and ineffectual.” (Quinones similar to
those produced by certain cockroaches have bac-
tericidal properties, and may some day conceivably
ﬁnd a role as medical antibiotics.)

At least one roach has wholly abandoned cow-
ardice in favor of aggression. This roach, with the
suitably frightening name Gromphadorhina por-
tentosa, not only produces an odor but makes a
10ud, hissing sound when disturbed. The males are
sometimes as much as four inches long and have
a pair of thick horns just behind their heads. When
males chance upon one another they charge and
push each other back and forth with their horns,
all the while hissing loudly. This roach is a native
of Madagascar and has not become domesticated,
thank God; it is not the sort of thing one would
want to encounter on his kitchen shelf.

The lives of cockroaches are remarkably auto-
mated. Apparently they don’t even have to rely
on their senses to decide when to go out on their
nightly prowls. This was demonstrated by Dr.
Janet Harker of Cambridge University, England,
who found that American roaches kept in constant
darkness nevertheless became more active when it
was night outside, at least for a period of several
days. Apparently a hormone is released from a
group of cells in the head every twenty-four hours
and “tells” the roach to bestir itself. A beheaded
cockroach can’t tell the time of day—not because
he has no eyes but because he has lost the glands

which produce this hormone. When Dr. Harker‘

implanted a gland that was producing hormone

by Howard E. Evans 53

rhythmically, she could restore the rhythm of ac-
tivity in the headless roach. By subjecting the
gland to temperatures close to freezing she was
able to “reset the clock.” However, this could be
done only with a transplanted gland; when left in
the original roach, the gland resets itself. It isn’t
quite clear why cockroaches need a system for
“instrument takeoffs” when they can tell when it
is dark simply by looking out of their crevices.

The Chemistry of Love

Like other insects, roaches have no hormones
produced by their sex organs. They hardly need
them, adult insects being designed for reproduc-
tion and not much else. They do have certain
built-in inhibiting devices, however; insects can-
not afford to spend all their waking hours in sex,
phonetics notwithstanding. We know that certain
endocrine glands in the head of a female roach
have much inﬂuence on the formation of her eggs.
In some species, if these glands are removed soon
after the female becomes sexually mature, she
fails to produce a chemical—known as a pheromone
—which attracts males, and is therefore very likely
doomed to spinsterhood. But if she is doused with
sex attractant taken from normal females, she can
attract males and mates in the usual manner.
When a female Surinam roach is pregnant, pres-
sure of the developing eggs sends a nervous im-
pulse to the head which suppresses these same
glands and thus stops production of the sex at-
tractant until the eggs are laid.

Many other insects produce pheromones, and
the study of their chemistry and effects is cur-
rently a very active ﬁeld of biology. In some cock-
roaches, the male must actually contact the female
before being stimulated, while in other cases the
pheromone attracts males from a distance.

 




54 THE WORLD OF THE COCKROACH

The German roach has paid for its intimacy
with man by having its sex life analyzed in great
detail. When a male detects the pheromone of a
female, he faces his intended spouse and the pair
begin to “fence” with their antennae. Shortly
thereafter he turns completely around and faces
away from her, at the same time raising his wings
at about a 90-degree angle. Through this gesture
he is offering her his own chemical attractants,
which exude from glands on his back. If court-
ship is proceeding well, the female climbs upon
his back and begins to feed on these exudates,
which lure her into copulating position. After a
few seconds the male begins to push himself far-
ther back beneath the female, at the same time
extruding his genital organs. These are extraordi-
nary structures, resembling nothing so much as a
Boy Scout jackknife, with its various blades and
bottle and can openers. With the longest of these
books the male clamps onto a small crescent-
shaped plate at the tail end of the female. Then he
moves out from under her and turns about facing
away from her. Other, smaller hooks are then at-
tached to other structures on the female, who is
literally “hooked” for the hour or two required
for copulation.

Dr. Louis Roth, of the U. S. Army Laboratories
in Natick, Massachusetts, has found important
differences in the reproductive behavior of various
species. The American roach is more direct than
the German, the male pushing himself beneath the

female with hardly any preliminaries. In this spe-
cies and in many others, males are greatly stimu-
lated by female sex pheromone even in the absence
of females. If ﬁlter paper is taken from the bottom
of a cage of females and placed in a cage of males,
the latter become greatly excited, ﬂutter their
wings, and attempt to mate with the paper.
Workers at the United States Department of Agri-
culture have succeeded in isolating the sex at-
tractant of the American roach by passing a
stream of air through jars containing thousands
of females, collecting the vapor by freezing it with
dry ice. In nine months, they obtained 12.2 milli-
grams (about .0004 ounces) of this substance,
which proved to be intensely exciting to males.

Dr. Robert Barth of the University of Texas,
who has become something of a Sigmund Freud to
the roach world, ﬁnds that homosexuality is rare
among roaches. However, he reports that when
female pheromone is introduced into a cage of
male Cuban roaches, they tear about their cage
and proceed to court one another furiously. All
steps in heterosexual courtship can be seen, except
of course for the ﬁnal hooking together of the
genitalia. We still know very little about the ac-
tual nature of these potent sex attrac-tants. Per-
haps it is just as well.

The eggs of roaches are produced in neat little
packets which, in our homes and laboratory cages,
are simply dropped on the ﬂoor, to hatch some
time later if they do not dry up or become food for

another roach. But we now know that this behav-
ior is the result of an abnormal environment. In
their natural habitats most roaches safeguard the
next generation by concealing their eggs.

I watched one method in a Florida state park on
a warm spring evening several years ago. Around
me were several female giant Florida roaches—a
brown, Wingless, and rather odorous species that
has not become domesticated to any extent. Each
had an egg case protruding from the end of her
body, and each was digging a hole in the sand or
at least looking for a place to dig. When she had
selected a suitable spot she made a series of
backward strokes with her head, piling the sand
beneath and behind her. After the hole was about
a third of an inch deep, she dribbled saliva into
it, picked up the moistened sand grains with her
mouth and eventually molded a trough-shaped
cavity of proper size and shape to ﬁt the egg cap-
sule. Next she straddled the pit, released the egg
case, and slid it into the hole with movements of
her abdomen, turning around and making ﬁnal ad-
justments with her mandibles. Then she plastered
moistened sand over the top of the egg case and
smoothed it over. Finally after more than an
hour of hard work, she wandered off into the
darkness, having effectively protected against
predators, parasites, and desiccation offspring she
would never see herself.

In laboratory cages, this same roach, like other
species, merely drops her egg cases on the ﬂoor.
But if she is provided with sand, she will act out
her normal egg-burying behavior (to a bleary-
eyed audience, sometime in the middle of the
night).

Worth Lifetimes of Study

Other roaches have ouite different methods of
protecting their eggs. The German roach, for ex-
ample, carries her egg case around, projecting
from the end of her body, and even transfers water
to it. She drops it when the eggs are ready to
hatch. The female Madeira and Surinam roaches,
after extruding the egg case, draw it back into
the body, where it occupies a special brood sac
until hatching occurs. These roaches are unique
in being “born twice,” since the eggs ﬁrst leave the
body of the female and are then drawn back in, to
emerge a second time as young roaches. In the
brood sac, the eggs are thoroughly protected and
are supplied with water and, in at least one case,
with nutriment. The Surinam roach has even dis-
pensed with the nuisance of having a male sex;
one strain of this species consists entirely of fe-

males which produce live female young, which
grow up to produce live female young, and so on
ad inﬁnitum. If there is a more efﬁcient reproduc-
tive mechanism, the roaches will undoubtedly ﬁnd
it.

When a scientist is asked what good his research
is, the classic answer (and a good one) is a shrug
of the shoulders. To a student of roaches, it is self-
evident that any creature so beautifully adapted
and adaptable is worth lifetimes of study. If there
are any underlying principles of long-term sur-
vival, surely they are evidenced by the roaches. Of
the 3,500 species now living fewer than 5 per cent
have been studied in any detail. What we do know
suggests that every species is a story in itself, and
that even our best-known species have still to yield
ﬁnal answers on many details of body function.
The study of roaches may lack the aesthetic values
of bird-watching and the glamour of space ﬂight,
but nonetheless it would seem to be one of the more
worthwhile human activities. In fact, as I scan the
evening paper, I wonder if it may not be more
worthwhile than most of them.

ANIMAL WELFARE GROUPS SPLIT
OVER 'DOGNAPPING' BILL

An ”antidognapping” bill now in House—Senate conference
has produced one of the most massive letter-writing campaigns
in recent years and has split the animal welfare movement.
Today's story and Fact Sheet give the background of animal
welfare legislation, describe the bill now before Congress
and explain the disputes over the measure. (Note: The
House—Senate conference considering the ”dognapping” bill

is scheduled to meet again July 26.)

 




~Congressional Quarterly Inc. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

July 22 , 1966
About 850 words

By Congressional Quarterly

Washington, July —~ The animal welfare movement of the United States has
split wide open over a provision of the ”antidognapping” bill, which is now being
put in final form by a House-Senate conference committee.

The provision was sponsored by Sen. A.S. Mike Monroney (D Okla.) and included
in the Senate version of the measure. It permits the Secretary of Agriculture to
move into research laboratories to prevent neglect and mistreatment of laboratory
animals while they are being held by the laboratories before and after experi-
mentation. It does not allow the Secretary to interfere with the actual conduct
of research or to impose any conditions for the handling of animals during actual
research. I

Some of the animal welfare groups, led by the Humane Society of the United
States and including the American Humane Assn., the two biggest organizations, favor
dropping the laboratory care provision altogether. They believe it is too weak,
and they fear that its enactment would take the steam out of a long-term drive for
much stronger legislation on humane treatment of laboratory animals.

The stronger legislation, which the humane organizations have been pushing
for six years with relatively little success, would permit the Government to
require the maximum possible humane treatment of laboratory animals during the
actual conduct of research itself. This stronger legislation is fiercely op—
posed by nearly the entire biomedical research community and the National In-
stitutes of Health, the major federal research agency, for fear it would hamper

medical research and even possibly lead to antivivisectionist measures later on.

Amendment Support

A second faction of the animal welfare movement, led by Mrs. Christine
Stevens (the wife of Roger Stevens, who is chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center
for the Performing Arts and the President's adviser on the arts) has been fight—
ing in favor of the Monroney amendment. Mrs. Stevens heads the Society for
Animal Protective Legislation and the Animal Welfare Institute. The groups
supporting her include the Virginia Federation of Humane Societies, the Massa-
chusetts Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and WARDS (Welfare of

Animals Used for Research in Drugs and Surgery), whose chairman is the wife of Sen.
Monroney.

Mrs. Stevens argues that the publicity over the past year on the kidnapping of
pets for sale to medical research institutions has given the animal welfare move—
ment an unprecedented opportunity to pass an ”antidognapping” measure. Why not
include some provisions on humane treatment in laboratories now, she says, while
continuing to work for later passage of stronger legislation. She does not believe
retention of the Monroney amendment would harm the chances of future legislation.

In recent weeks, the two different factions of the animal welfare movement
have been conducting strong letter-writing campaigns over the issue of whether
to adopt the Monroney amendment. The House Agriculture Committee said it had
been receiving hundreds of letters a day urging the Committee to kill the Monroney
amendment when the bill went to conference. Letters in favor of retaining the
Monroney amendment have been received also.

A few of the animal welfare organizations favor killing the entire bill as too
weak —~ not only the provisions on care in laboratories but also the basic "anti—
dognapping” provisions. The National Catholic Society for Animal Welfare, for
example, July 10 staged an 80-woman picketing demonstration at the White House,
asking the President to veto the bill when it finally reached him because both

the House and Senate versions were far too weak.

Background of Drive

 

From the beginning, the ”antidognapping” measure has been one of the most
massively lobbied bills in recent years. The campaign for an "antidognapping"
measure was kicked off in mid-1965 by Rep. Joseph Y. Resnick (D N.Y.) as a
result of a case involving alleged theft of a family pet for sale to a hospital
in the Bronx for research purposes.

The case was given wide publicity by Resnick, Sens. Joseph S. Clark (D Pa.)
and other members of Congress, as well as by many newspapers. Humane societies
and animal welfare organizations began mounting a massive letter—writing campaign
to Congress, which by mid-1966 saw over 60,000 letters sent to the House Agriculture
Committee and over 20,000 to the Senate Commerce Committee, the two groups which
handled the ”antidognapping” bills. Individuallkxﬂxnmsof Congress also received
heavy mail-~in many cases, heavier than on any other legislation.

Advocates of federal legislation to curb ”dognapping” pointed out that in
recent years there had been a tremendous growth of biomedical and drug research
where animals were used for experiments. Much of the research was conducted or
financed by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare's National Institutes

of Health. The most conservative sources estimated that there were at least 50

to 60 million animals used for research annually, mainly rats and mice, but also
guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, monkeys and perhaps as many as 2 million dogs and
cats.

Most of the rats and mice are specifically bred for research purposes, but the
dogs and cats are usually purchased by the research institutions from animal dealers
or city pounds, often bringing up to $30 each for larger dogs.

Humane organizations charge that crooks and unscrupulous individuals, seeking
to turn a fast buck, go around stealing dogs and cats from the streets and back-
yards for sale through animal dealers to research institutions. They also charge,
and demonstrated in a widely publicized series of raids on animal dealers, that
conditions at animal dealers holding dogs and cats for sale to laboratories are
sometimes extremely inhumane-—involving starvation, overcrowding, lack of water,

poor sanitation and excessive physical restraint of the animal in tiny cages.

Congressional Action

 

As a result of the charges and publicity, the House and Senate both passed
"antidognapping" measures early in l966 that would empower the Secretary of
Agriculture, through a system of licensing, to combat the theft of animals for
sale to laboratories and to require animal dealers to observe humane practices
with regard to food, sanitation and housing in the handling, transportation and
sale of research animals. The House version applied only to dogs and cats, while
the Senate version applied to some other animals as well.

Virtually the entire humane movement agreed on these provisions. But Sen.
Monroney’s proposal to let the Secretary of Agriculture require humane care of
animals which were already in research institutions brought the tremendous split
in the animal welfare movement.

Humane organizations are not the only ones vitally concerned with the bill.
The National Institutes of Health and the national biomedical research community,
whose spokesman is the National Society for Medical Research, deeply feared the
Monroney provision, or any provision that would impose controls on the use or
handling of animals by research institutions.

The two at first worked strenuously to defeat the Monroney amendment in the
Senate Commerce Committee. However, after the Committee had watered down the
Monroney provision by allowing research institutions themselves to determine when
animals are being used for the actual conduct of research-~and therefore are exempt
from the Secretary of Agriculture's regulation—~the National Institutes of Health
indicated it would accept the Senate Commerce version. A spokesman said acceptance
of the revised Monroney amendment would block--for at least five years, hopefully--
any major public support for stronger legislation regulating the conduct of research

itself.

C ‘ Pressures On Congress

 

Q

HUMANE GROUPS SPLIT ON “DOGNAPPING” BILL

The “dognapping” bill (HR 18881), which went to a
House-Senate conference July 21, produced one of the
most massive letter-writing campaigns of recent years,
stimulated by animal welfare organizations. But the bill
also caused a sharp dispute within the animal welfare
movement itself and met strong opposition on certain
provisions from the nation’s medical research community
and the Johnson Administration. (For House and Senate
floor action, see Weekly Report p. 910, 1829.)

The House version of the bill was passed April 28. It
authorized the Agriculture Department to take steps (1) to
curb the theft of dogs and cats from streets and backyards
by persons seeking to sell them for research purposes and
(2) to require humane treatment of dogs and cats by dealers
engaged in the business of selling the animals to research
institutions for experimental purposes. These provisions
were strongly supported by virtually all animal welfare
organizations. Although it took some prodding, the Ad-
ministration also backed the House version of the bill, as did
the National Society for Medical Research, spokesman for
the nation’s medical research community.

The Senate version of the bill, passed June 22, made
two major changes sponsored by Sen. A.S. Mike Monroney
(D Okla.) and pushed through the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee by him. One extended the coverage to certain re—
search animals -— guinea pigs, monkeys, rabbits and
hamsters —- in addition to cats and dogs.

The second empowered the Secretary of Agriculture
to require research institutions to observe humane condi-
tions in feeding, housing and caring for the research
animals while they were being held by the institution but
were not actually being used in the conduct of research.

It was this provision which caused the dispute within
the animal welfare movement and which aroused the con-
cern of medical research groups. The Senate language made
clear that the Secretary was not authorized to regulate the
conduct of research itself in any way or to impose any types
of limits -- humane or otherwise -- on the kinds 'of
experiments for which animals could be used or on the
conditions for the animals which existed during the conduct
of research; the Secretary’s authority was designed to
protect the animals in laboratories against overcrowding,
poor sanitation, hunger, thirst and mistreatment only
during the periods before and after actual experimental use.
Nevertheless, the medical research community and the
National Institutes of Health (the main federal medical
research agency) deeply feared the Senate provision on re-
search institutions as a threat to freedom of research. They
feared that the provision might prove the opening wedge
for the eventual imposition of direct federal standards and
limitations on the use of animals in biomedical research and
even eventually for antivivisectionist legislation.

The research facilities provision was at first strenuously
opposed both by the Johnson Administration and the
National Society for Medical Research. However, after
certain softening amendments had been added by the
Senate Commerce Committee and when it became clear

that Monroney was going to be able to win enactment of
the provision, the Administration reluctantly accepted the
provision -— chiefly in the hope that its adoption would
cause a drop in public and Congressional interest in the
subject and thus would blunt for a number of years
attempts by animal welfare groups to obtain much stronger
legislation which would regulate the handling of animals
during the conduct of research itself.

The dispute within the animal welfare movement
turned on the question of whether it was tactically wise to
support the Monroney provision on research facilities
instead of working for a much stronger provision.

One faction, led by the Humane Society of the US
and including the American Humane Assn., favored leaving
the Monroney provision out of the “dognapping” bill.
Spokesmen argued that enactment of the provision in 1966
would blunt public interest in the question of humane
treatment of animals in laboratories and thus would slow
up the drive, which began in 1960, for legislation to re-
quire humane treatment of animals during the conduct of
research itself.

A second faction was led by Mrs. Christine Stevens,
wife of Presidential special assistant Roger Stevens and
head of the Society for Animal Protective Legislation and
the Animal Welfare Institute, and included such groups as
the Virginia Federation of Humane Societies, Massachu-
setts Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and
WARDS (Welfare of Animals Used for Research in Drugs
and Surgery), the latter headed by the wife of Sen. Mon-
roney. They strongly favored including the Monroney
amendment in the “dognapping” bill. They argued that
publicity in the past year on the kidnapping of pets for
sale to medical research institutions had given the animal
welfare movement the public support to pass a “dognap-
ping” bill and that some provisions on humane treatment
in laboratories could be included now while work con-
tinued for more comprehensive legislation later.

History of Dispute

Background. The humane (or animal welfare) move-
ment in the United States totals about 6 million persons
belonging to hundreds of different local, state, regional and
national organizations, many with overlapping member-
ships and loose affiliations with each other. Among the
largest and most active groups are the Humane Society of
the US, with a mailing list of 60,000 persons plus five
state branches and 80 affiliated groups, and the American
Humane Assn. Also of substantial size was Mrs. Stevens’
Animal Welfare Institute, with a mailing list of about
16,000. Mrs. Stevens said that in the mid-19505 she and
a few others set up the Society for Animal Protective Leg—
islation as a lobbying organization for animal welfare causes,
without any mass membership but with a substantial
mailing list.

In 1960, the Society for Animal Protective Legislation
sponsored a bill (S 8570), introduced by Sen. Joseph S.
Clark (D Pa.) and others, to require humane treatment of

laboratories but only dealers. The House version of the
bill, passed April 28, met these two conditions.

Senate Action. The Administration’s own proposal (S
3332) was finally introduced May 10 by Sen. Hill, dealing
only with conditions in laboratories. It authorized the
Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) to set
standards for the care of animals in laboratories, to be
checked on, possibly, by AAALAC; and to make grants to
cover up to two—thirds of the cost of building improved
animal care facilities in laboratories. Although the measure
had been under study for many months, most observers
told CQ that its introduction was actually probably chiefly
designed to ward off the Monroney laboratory provision,
which was then gaining strength in the Senate. Although
S 3332 did permit federal regulation of animal care in the
laboratory, spokesmen for scientific and research groups
told CO the bill would be preferable to the Monroney
amendment because S 3332 would be administered by the
HEW Department, which would never do anything to
interfere with the conduct of research, rather than by the
Agriculture Department.

Despite introduction of S 3332, the Administration was
unable to block the Monroney amendment to HR 13881 in
the Senate Commerce Committee. James A. Shannon,
director of the National Institutes of Health, at his own
request made an emergency appearance before the Com-
mittee May 28 to oppose the Monroney amendment. He
indicated that the Administration would accept the House
version of the bill.

The Humane Society worked strongly against the
Monroney amendment, and the Society for Animal Pro-
tective Legislation worked strongly for. The Commerce
Committee June 15 adopted the Monroney amendment,

although with three important changes designed to meet

specific Administration objections: (1) the Committee
added a phrase which permitted a research institution to
be its own judge as to when an animal was being used for
the actual conduct of research and therefore not subject to
regulations on housing, feeding, etc; (2) it added a phrase
which would exclude hospitals from the definition of re-
search facilities unless they purchased cats and dogs for
research (many did not); (3) it dropped licensing require-
ments for research facilities and substituted a simple reg-
istration requirement.

With these changes, HR 13881 was passed by the
Senate June 22. The National Society for Medical Re-
search, in a June 21 newsletter, and the NIH, in private
communications to the Commerce Committee, said that the
changes made in the Monroney amendment just before
the bill‘ was reported had reduced the Monroney amend-
ment’s potential harmfulness sufficiently so that the Sen-
ate-passed version of the bill was not likely to harm
biomedical research throughout the nation. A NIH spokes—
man July 19 told CQ that, consequently, the NIH now
preferred the Senate version of HR 13881 to the House
version because, by covering laboratories with a provision
that was not harmful, the Monroney amendment would end
“for at least five years, we hope,” the possibility of any
stronger, more objectionable legislation. He added that the
NIH hoped, however, that the conferees would limit the
final bill to dogs and cats only (dropping other animals)
and would drop excessively strong “search and seizure”
provisions in Section 15 of the Senate version.

As the bill went to conference, the House Agriculture
Committee was still receiving several hundred letters a

day, mainly stimulated by the Humane Society of the
US, asking it to insist in conference on killing the
Monroney amendment lest its enactment block later strong
“conduct of research” legislation. Moreover, the National
Catholic Society for Animal Welfare July 10 picketed the
White House, asking the President to veto HR 13881 be-
cause both House and Senate versions were too weak.

animals during the conduct of research. In subsequent
years, the Society supported and worked for similar legis-
lation, and so did the Humane Society of the US. The
latest such bills were S 1071, introduced in 1965 by Sen.
Clark and backed by the Society for Animal Protective
Legislation; and S 2576, introduced in 1965 by Sen.
Thomas J. McIntyre (D NH.) and backed by the Humane
Society of the US. and the American Humane Assn.
These were not antivivisectionist measures. Rather, they
set up rules and mechanisms requiring research to be con-
ducted under conditions to reduce pain, avoid duplication
of experimentation, provide good food and clean quarters,
limit the numbers of animals used for experiments under
certain conditions. The medical and scientific community
in the United States strongly opposed all such bills, saying
that the actual provisions themselves would limit freedom
of research, require federal approval for different types of
experiments and might eventually open the door to more
drastic measures of an antivivisectionist nature that would
hamstring biomedical research. Although the various
humane organizations worked steadily over the years for
the passage of the legislation, the issue failed to catch
fire with the public. Congressional action also was blocked
by the strong opposition of the chairmen of the relevant
Congressional committees, Sen. Lister Hill (D Ala.) of the
Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee and Rep.
Oren Harris (D Ark.) of the House Interstate and Foreign
Commerce Committee.

“Dognapping” Issue. In mid-1965, as a result of an
incident involving the alleged theft of a family dog in
Pennsylvania for sale to Montefiore HOSpital in the Bronx,
New York City, Rep. Joseph Y. Resnick (D N.Y.), whose
district included the hospital, became interested in the
subject of “dognapping.” Upon investigation, Resnick
was told that millions of animals (some estimates were
as high as 300 million; estimates available to the Na-
tional Institutes] of Health put the figure at perhaps 60
million) were used each year in research, the bulk of them
mice and rats, but perhaps as many as 1 million to 2 mil—
lion dogs and cats. Humane groups told Resnick that
many of these were pets stolen from backyards and streets
by unscrupulous persons and sold to animal dealers for
transmittal to research institutions. Poor sanitation, poor
food, thirst, crowding and general mistreatment were
common among dealers and in laboratories, it was said.

As a result, Resnick July 9, 1965, introduced and began
pushing a bill (HR 9748) to control thefts of dogs and cats,
to require humane treatment by animal dealers and to
require humane treatment by research institutions, though
not during the actual conduct of research but only before
and after actual experimentation was done. Sens. Clark
and Warren G. Magnuson (D Wash), chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee, July 25, 1965, cosponsored
a similar bill (S 2322), which was referred to Magnuson’s
committee.

Unlike the broader legislation long supported by the
humane organizations, the “dognapping” issue soon took
fire and began to receive public attention. The Humane
Society of the US, expressly for the purpose of pushing the
legislation, conducted a widely publicized series of raids on
dog storage farms and dog auctions where inhumane
treatment was alleged. The Society for Animal Protective
Legislation and the Humane Society of the US. took the
lead in pushing a letter-writing campaign to Congress in
support of “dognapping” legislation. This campaign

ultimately developed into one of the heaviest mail cam-
paigns in many years. The Senate Commerce Committee
told CQ that in the year between July 1965 and July 1966,
it had received some 20,000 letters, the vast majority
favoring “dognapping” legislation; the House Agriculture
Committee, which handled the House legislation, received
60,000 letters of the same type over the same period, and
was still getting several hundred a day as conferees pre-
pared to meet. Individual members also received very
heavy mail. Several sources said a Feb. 4, 1966, picture
article in Life magazine on “dognapping” and inhumane
treatment had given a substantial push to the “dognapping”
legislation.

House Hearings. On Sept. 2, 1965, the House Agri-
culture Livestock and Feed Grains Subcommittee held
hearings on “dognapping” bills, at which time the split
between the HUmane Society of the US and the Society
for Animal Protective Legislation on whether to include
research facilities in the bill became evident. No Ad—
ministration witness appeared. The only witness for the
National Society for Medical Research (whose 211 con-
stituent member organizations include virtually all profes-
sional medical groups, drug research laboratories, schools
of medicine, university laboratories and other elements of
the medical research community) indicated strong reser—
vations.

By early 1966, pressure and letter-writing for a
“dognapping” bill had begun to assume intense propor-
tions. The House Subcommittee March 7-8 and the Senate
Commerce Committee March 25 and 28 held hearings on
the “dognapping” legislation. The National Society for
Medical Research, in its first clear statement of position
to the committees, March 7 said (1) the bill should be
limited to theft of pets and inhumane treatment by dealers
and should not include any provisions on handling of
animals in laboratories; (2) there was no evidence of kid-
napping or mistreatment of rats, mice, guinea pigs and
animals other than dogs and cats, and therefore, such
animals should be excluded from legislation to avoid enor—
mous costs that were really unnecessary. The Society also
said that the need for any legislation regarding the treat-
ment of animals in laboratories was obviated by the creation
in 1965 of an organization called the American Assn. for
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC), es-
tablished by 16 organizations including the Society, the
American Medical Assn., the Assn. of American Medical
Colleges, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn., the
Animal Care Panel (an organization of medical and re-
search organizations plus some breeders of laboratory
animals and manufacturers of laboratory animal cages and
instruments, created in 1950 to improve laboratory animal
care) and several others. This group was prepared to
undertake a voluntary accreditation program for labora-
tories. (Humane groups ridiculed the idea of self-
regulation, saying the members of AAALAC were them—
selves the main users of laboratory animals and that it
would be another case of letting the fox guard the chicken
coop.)

The Administration sent no witnesses to these hearings.
However, in a March 7 letter to the House Agriculture
Committee, the Agriculture Department said that the
Budget Bureau did not favor enactment at that time be—
cause it was still working on its own draft proposals;
nevertheless, if a bill should be passed, it should apply only
to dogs and cats and should not cover handling in

 




laboratories but only dealers. The House version of the
bill, passed April 28, met these two conditions.

Senate Action. The Administration’s own proposal (S
3382) was finally introduced May 10 by Sen. Hill, dealing
only with conditions in laboratories. It authorized the
Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) to set
standards for the care of animals in laboratories, to be
checked on, possibly, by AAALAC; and to make grants to
cover up to two—thirds of the cost of building improved
animal care facilities in laboratories. Although the measure
had been under study for many months, most observers
told CQ that its introduction was actually probably chiefly
designed to ward off the Monroney laboratory provision,
which was then gaining strength in the Senate. Although
S 8332 did permit federal regulation of animal care in the
laboratory, spokesmen for scientific and research groups
told CQ the bill would be preferable to the Monroney
amendment because S 8882 would be administered by the
HEW Department, which would never do anything to
interfere with the conduct of research, rather than by the
Agriculture Department.

Despite introduction of S 3382, the Administration was
unable to block the Monroney amendment to HR 18881 in
the Senate Commerce Committee. James A. Shannon,
director of the National Institutes of Health, at his own
request made an emergency appearance before the Com-
mittee May 28 to oppose the Monroney amendment. He
indicated that the Administration would accept the House
version of the bill.

The Humane Society worked strongly against the
Monroney amendment, and the Society for Animal Pro-
tective Legislation worked strongly for. The Commerce

Committee June 15 adopted the Monroney amendment,

although with three important changes designed to meet

a satisfactory one, and that it will be enacted into
law, in that case, before the adjournment this year.
Harriet seems to be enjoying her work with the
commission although I have heard few details as yet.
Her teachers in Florence, in St.Louis and Austin have
found her talents in painting and design quite good.
Perhaps she'll do something with them one of these

days.

Good luck to you and your organization.

Sincerely,

Washington, D. C.

ear Sir;

Here are some questions I’d
me to the published answers

greatly appreciate your answering or directing
to:

'Why has there been such a tremenduous increase in the number of animals
needed for laboratory experiment in the last few years? Specifically,
what are some of the undertakings that have made such a great difference?

Why have the theories changed so drastically about the desirable ways to
procure and maintain lab animals? a few years ago I saw two articles that
went into great detail about the careful nutrition, sanitation, exercise,
etc. considered essential for productive use of experimental animals.

one was in the Gaines Dog Food Company newsletter and it said ”hven
mental distress in the subject can make the experiment inconclusive."
With as many variables as disease—exposed and underfed dealer dogs would
'hring to the experiments, how can they accomplish anything? Is this
carelessness part of the reason why so many of our drugs now are undep—
endable?

What factors create a business where a commodity worth handling is not
worth delivering in usable conditiond A HS field man told me about some

lab spokesman saying 30 to $0% of the dealer~dogs often must be destroyed

on delivery because they are unfit for use. How does it happen that buyers
are so desperate they stand for this, or so full~nanded they don't care?

If government subsidy makes them indifferent to cost, why can they not
manage to provide suitable quarters and care7/éiafter all, that would create
jobs. Do they take the time and expense to brinf the remainder of the
dealer’s dogs into good health and stamina again? How do they figure then
that ik‘is still less expensive than rearing their own ? Isn’t it true that
the large feed manufacturers have always reared their own in order to have
maximum control in the experiments?

These questions have not been.asswered in anything I've come across so far
and I would love to know what people in the humane societies have said on
these subjects and also what some of tte opponents have said. My reason
for asking is that I have a contract to write a juvenile mystery which could
be about the foiling of dog~nappers. he have one inthis county, 3 I have

a perfect opportunity for getting authentic backgroind and my publisher

9s ems inclined to tare this regardless of the outcome of the legislation.

If the senate passes the bills, unwatered, it will have value from recording
an evil that did exist and try men's souls on the questions of getting
involved or n55: deciding just where animals rate in the right to life and
comfort, etc. If the bills don’t pass, than the existance of the evil still
will enable the book perhaps to do some good in combating it.

I'll appreciate any help you can give and will not be quoting anyone without

permission...if you can take time for any personal answer, I‘ll Know the

effort it probably takes amid other duties. If you can send me newsletters,

6t0.: I'll be grateful and will return anything you need back....word of

honor. Please send me also younmember-introductory material so I may

join AWI; I'd been watching for your address ever since reading the Gaines
which w s based on your recommendations. Thanks very much....

Throughout the snowy winter and

The controversy about man's best

aﬁecr our sulzurhs in various ways;
Millhurn police report that the town
gets stuck with very few unwanted
animals, because mosr are claimed
within the allotted time. Other towns,
like l‘vltinttilair and East Orange, find
themselves overwhelmed with hun»
hundreds of homeless pets.

Some towns have Animal Welfare
Leagues that cooperate with the po-
lice by finding homes for cats and
«logs. Miss (Loista Grant is the
founder and president of the Mont-
clair Animal Welfare League and an
active memlier of the. New jersey So‘
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals. She and her small group of
dedicated ladies make brave efforts to
provide homes for the animals carted
till the streets. They maintain a pound
in Tmy l-lills where the creatures are
sheltered until a home is found. This
may take months, years, or it may
never happen at all. "We never des-
troy an animal" Miss Grant assured
us "unless it is violent or mortally
sick.” hilt: also told of sutx-rhurr‘ian
efforts to raise money for this project,
through “homage. sales, Carri parties,
and public appeals. "We are in real
financial distress, and I don't know
how much longer we can keep on gt»
mg" she told us sadly.

Another organization looking for
funds in New jersey is the state SPCA.

My interest

in this legisla—
tion was noted
in your news-
‘paper in an
article 11 n d e r

d ateline 01°
Maich 25 Wiit-
ten by one of

The aiticle v

a ”it .

Sen. Dominick
Dan Thomasson.
s W1itten during
One of the bean 1ings held by the

Senate Committee on Commerce
and stated in part:

“ONE D1131 .lIGGS strayed a
little too far, 110 was picked up
and sold at least three times,

each time with his owner just a
few steps behind. lie never got»

home. The only difference be-
t\veen Jim; and other do gs and
cats Which end up on there-
‘ search blOck was that Jiggs
belon red to a US Senator. And
the Senator, Peter H. Dominick

v of Colorado, has never forgotten -

it.”

I assure you this very real
and tragic experience profound-
_ ly affected my entire family.

This incident points to the
first of three distinct problems——
the prOblem of animal theft
which, I feel, must be dealt
with in the pending legislation.

In many cases these stolen
pet's end up in a “dog auction”
where hundreds of dogs may be
sold in one e1ening.’lhei1 new

“owners” Oiten spiiit them
across 'the nearest state line
where they are sold again to a
“legitimate” dealer with no
questions asked. The dogs are
then sold to research insti-
tutions with. a bill of sale
furnished at the dog auction.

ZN l‘rIY VIEW the prep-osed
legislation must provide a solu-

tion to the aroblcm of tracking
those stolen pets and preventing
unscrupulous dealers from mak—

ing profits out of the misery

they create.

Senate Bill 322, which is
now pending before the Senate
Committee on Commerce, would,
in my View, effectively control
this trafficking in stolen pets.

The bill would require, in
part, that all. dealers be licensed;
that accurate records be kept as
to the purcha re, sale, t1 ansporta-
tion, identification and pi evious
ownership oi‘ the animals; and
that a dealer cannot dispose of
any dog; or cat until five days
after acquisition. Research ia-

eilities would be prohibited from 7_
from other

purchasing animals
than licensed dealers.
It is hOp-ed that this bill would

, entirely eliminate the unscrup-

ulous dealings now occurring in
many of our states.

THE SECOND P it 0 I) L E M
which must be corrected by the
proposed legislation is treatment
and career animals while they
are in the hands oi‘ dealers. The
hearings pioduced testimony on
this point which was equally
shocking.

Many times animals are not
fed from the time they are
bought or stolen until they fi—

. nally reach the 1eseai ch, facility.

Testimony was presented de—
scribing how the animals are
literally jammed by the dozens
into a. car trunk and hauled
without food or water for many
hours across state lines to avoid
detection.

Sick animals are mixed with
well animals; and in some cases,
animals die en enroute but are

promulgate standaids for the

these animals.

These st an d a r d 5 would, I
hope, help to eliminate this par—
ticular problem.

.1113 third problem, in my.
opinion is the standa 1d of care
animals receive aftci they reach

m 1 escarbii 1"riStitutions.

The requirement that. research

laboratories must purchase the

animals only from licensed
dealers will help keep a check
on the ancestry of the animals
and p1 ovme a method of check-
ing on their treatment at the
laboratory.

We are all avare that; the
heart, cancer and other research
conducted in these institutionsis
vital to our medical knowledge
and progress. For that reason
efforts are being,r made to work
out humane animal treatment
conditions at the laboratories.

I greatly appreciate the hun—
dreds of cards and letters I have
received on this subject, and I
assure'you I fully intend to sup--
port S. 2322 both in committee
and on the ilom of tne Senate.

Best 1ega1ds.

Sincerely,
"Peter H. Dominick
'United States Senator.»

were without, water in August,
the deer wasicovered; with ver-

She tennéd a major victory

in the fight for decent treatment

of laboratory annuals " a bill

of this legislation.” .

Miss Steven-s was introduced
by George S. Kepner Jr., Coop-

audience that this year the
county S.P.C.A. was particularly
active on the federal level.
“When you get a card asking

HUMAN E TREATMENT OF ANIMALS

Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, I send to
the desk for appropriate reference a bill
to provide for the humane treatment of
animals by the Federal Government and
by institutions receiving grants from the
Federal Government.

Similar proposed legislation was in-
troduced by me {in the 87th and 88th
Congresses. I am happy to note that the
Senator from, Ohio [Mr. YOUNG], who
cosponsored the original measure, and I
have been joined by the Senator from
Alaska [Mr. BARTLETT] and the Senator
from Virginia [Mr. BYRD]. I am particu-
larly happy to ﬁnd myself a cosponsor of
this uSeful piece of proposed legislation
with the senior Senator from Virginia
[Mr. BYRD], to whom we are all so much
indebted for‘ long service in this body.

The growing list of cosponsors is rep-
resentative of an increasing awareness of
the problems which this bill attacks and
of the need for legislation to deal with
these problems.

This is not a liberal or a conservative,
a rightwing or a leftwing. measure. It
has broad ideological support. It has the
support of all men, both liberal and con-
servative, who are concerned about the
kind of record our civilization is making

in caring for helpless, speechless, vote-
less animals who can form no pressure
group or lobby of their own, but must
rely entirely on the compassion of those
who can speak out and can vote.

There are sound precedents for this
bill. In 1876 Great Britain enacted a
law licensing scientists who conduct ex-
periments on animals, registering the

places where the work is done, and mak-,

ing them open to inspection by qualiﬁed
inspectors. This law provides for hu-
mane treatment of the animals and the
humane design of experiments. It is not
an antivivisection measure. The legis-
lation in England has been an unqualiﬁed
success for almost 90 years. There is no
reason Why similar proposed legislation
in this country should not be equally
successful.

These are, in sum, the principles upon
which this bill is based. It is simple,
workable legislation which could not
hamper genuine research but which will,
if enacted, have a most salutary effect
on the care and use of thousands of ani-
mals which enter laboratories in our
country each year.

Mr. President, my record in support
of medical research and education speaks
for itself. I would not introduce or sup-

S mate

port any measure to outlaw or curtail
research which is responsibly and hu-
manely conducted.

But I believe that there is no need for
a country as idealistic in tradition, and
as rich in resources as the United States
to condone the suffering which great.
numbers of these animals undergo be-
fore they die. This needless suffering
does nothing to advance science or hu-
man welfare. On the contrary, research
performed on unhealthy animals accom-a
panied by unnecessary pain contributes
to scientiﬁc error, misleading data,
wasted funds, confusion in scientiﬁc lit-
erature, and demoralization of labora-
tory personnel.

And yet opposition to this bill, con-
ducted under the pretense of protecting
legitimate research from redtape and
government bureaucracy, has delayed
action on the legislation. This opposi-
tion comes in large measure from the
organizations which prey upon helpless
animals for proﬁt made by selling the
animals to laboratories for research ex-
periments.

These organizations often try to fore-
stall action on this measure at the Fed-
eral level by stating that there; are State
anticruelty laws. The fact is that 12

States speciﬁcally exempt research done
in scientiﬁc institutions from anticruelty
statutes and that, in any event, the State
anticruelty laWs were not designed to deal
with cruelty and neglect in laboratories.

Research in the biological sciences now
receives more support from the US. Gov-
ernment than from any other source.
This bill applies only to vertebrate ani-
mals used in experiments and tests by
Federal agencies and by recipients of
grants from the Federal Government.
It is our responsibility no longer to con-
done needless suffering.

It is my hope that in this session of
Congress hearings will be held in order
to dispel some of the misunderstandings
that have arisen on this subject.

Mr. President, I am heartened by the
editorial support that this bill has re-
ceived in the past from leading news-
papers throughout the Nation. A New
York Times editorial stated that the bill:

Would insure decent treatment of labora-
tory animals, including adequate rest and
exercise areas proper feeding and sanitation.
Where subjected to painful tests, animals
would be anesthetized—now not always the
case. None of these is antivivisection legis-
lation. Medical and scientiﬁc research must
continue for man’s health and beneﬁt. But
human carelessness and cruelty to animals
are always present—and always unnecessary.

The Washington Post stated that the
bill introduced last year is:

A simple sensible bill to provide for the
humane treatment of vertebrate animals
used in experiments and tests by recipients
of grants from the US. Government. It
aims to do no more than to minimize need—
less, wanton suffering. It has been carefully
drafted to avoid any impediment to rational
scientiﬁc study; it is in no sense an anti-
vivisection bill. It provides machinery for
reporting and inspection designed to assure
decent care of animals awaiting experimental
treatment, anesthetization when this would
not interfere with an experiment, and prompt
dispatch of a dying animal to avoid unnec-
essary agony when the experiment has been
completed.

. The Philadelphia Inquirer has said:
Legislation deﬁning civilized standards for

conducting research experiments and pro-

viding for inspection and enforcement is

immediately desirable and should be ap-
"zproved without any further pointless delay.

The Christian Science

Monitor
editorialized some time ago: '1

. \
Members of Congress and their constitu-
ents may be tempted to think that, in the '3

face of global upheavals and serious domestic
crises bills relating to the treatment of ani-
mals are unimportant. It is a false premise.
No matter involving the public conscience
is even relatively unimportant, and the
treatment of animals in experimental lab-
oratories is a matter of public conscience.

from his inhumanity to animals that he can
afford to
\‘indivisible.

Mr. President, I hope that in due
course companion legislation will be in-
troduced in the other body.

I ask unanimous consent that the bill
may lie at the desk until February 19 for
additional cosponsors.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill
will be received and appropriately re-
ferred; and, without objection, the re-
quest of the Senator from Pennsylvania
is granted.

The bill (S. 1071) to provide for the

humane treatment of vertebrate animals
used in experiments and tests by recipi-
ents of grants from the United States
and by agencies and instrumentalities
of the US. Government, and for other
purposes, introduced by Mr. CLARK (for
himself and other Senators), was re-
ceived, read twice by its title, and re-
ferred to the Committee on Labor and
Public Welfare.

bill’s provision for humane treatment before re-

However, as the legiSlation goes into conferenCe,

SENSIBLY ADMINISTERED, this legislation,
far from being an impediment to science, as some
seem to fear, will instead raise the standards 'of de-
