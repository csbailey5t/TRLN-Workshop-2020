KINSHIP

Copyright, 1903 £11

1 am the voice of the voiceless,

Through me the dumb shall speak,
Till the deaf world’s ear be made to hear

The wrongs of the wordless weak,
From street, from cage and from kennel,

From stable and zoo, the wail
Of my torture-d kin proclaims the sin

Of the mighwgainst the frail;

Oh, shame on the praying churchman
With his unstalled steed at the door,
Where the wimat with snow and sleet
Or the summer sun-rays pour;
And shame on the mothers of mortals
Who have not stopped to teach
Of the sorrow that lies in dear, dumb eyes,
The sorrow that has no speech.

The same Force formed the sparrow
That fashioned Man, the King.

The God of the Whole gave a spark of soul
To each furred and feathered thing.

’ And I am my brother’s keeper

Anml ﬁght his ﬁght,

And Speak the word for beast and bird
Till the world shall set things right.
