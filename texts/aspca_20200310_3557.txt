Silkys born in the Kalamazoo area. The sire is Clavon's Blue Busby from Newport, R. I. ,
while the dam hails from a kennel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Both are now owned by Mrs. Waber.

note from your editor: S'posin' you wanted to enter your Silky in a dog show ? Well, you'd fill out
an entry blank in the Premium List for the show and mail it in with your money. Or s'posin' your
Silky was scratching at fleas and you decided to give him a bath. Well, you'd draw some tepid
water, wash him with soap, rinse him, dry him, and comb him. In short, an exhibitor must send
in an entry blank and money to get entered in a dog show. And a Silky owner must bathe his Silky
to get him bathed.

There's a moral to this story: The way to get your Silky words printed is to send them to the P. O.
Box. And the way to see your Silky's photograph in print is to send it in, too. We'll look forward

Part III. "COMMENTS ON MODE OF COLOR INHERITANCE IN SILKY TERRIERS" by Betty

Young - in response to Mary Germany's comments on variations in color and type in the August
Newsletter.

"Australian Silky Terrier breeders have had problems with color too. One passage of
Mr. W. A. Wheatland's very fine book, '..'_The Australian Terrier and the Australian Silky
Terrier" is somewhat ambiguous (page 45, last paragraph), and sounds as if the author is saying
that silver blue with rich tan is not an acceptable color. When I wrote Mr. Wheatland for
clarification, he replied that the real silver blue (with good tan) is good, but that what he was
referring to was the nearly white dog being produced. He added the following item of interest:

"Between 1947 and 1958 there was a standard issued (which I have purposely kept out of
the book, so as not to confuse the issue further) which called for all blue coloring to be a real.
steel blue. This certainly was achieved, but the animals looked more like Yorkshire Terriers
than anything else. Not only were they small in size, but had short pinched faces. Furthermore
90% had black ears and faces, which was brought about by trying to get a topknot of dark gun—
metal blue. Well black ears and faces are taboo, so it was felt that some latitude must be given,
if we were to get size as well as color, for we must divorce the breed from the Yorkshire
Terrier. Hence the lighter shade of blue was permitted, and this caused many silver—white
dogs to be produced, (as) the breeders took too much liberty. "

I feel sure that Australian breeders are still striving, as we are here, for improvement in color
in the breed. '

If any of you know of any further reference book on color inheritance which might be
applicable to our breed, do let us know. Or, if anyone has done any color breeding that might
be helpful, or has kept extensive records of color from various matings, I am sure that other
breeders would be very much interested. "

Edna Ackerman, 7616 Bay Parkway, Brooklyn 14, N. Y. "I would appreciate your inserting a
little item in the Newsletter, as I would publicly like to thank all the Silky people I met for
their most gracious hospitality and to express my regrets at not having had the time to see all
the others. Peggy and Merle Smith really put themselves out to make my Visit a delight and I
would like to compliment all the California fanciers on having so gracious and knowledgeable a
person as Peggy. Thanks again to you. "

Howard Jensen, D'Under Silky Terriers, 77 6 Hayes St. , San Francisco, Calif. 94102 "Many
people think that the STCA is only for those owners who do nothing but eat, sleep and talk the
showing of Silkies. While we are concerned with the showing of the breed, because this
standardizes and improves it (there is still much room for improvement), there are two out-—
standing people in the club who are not "all show." ' They have more than done their share in
the rings at one time or another and probably be found from time to time at shows in the future,
but basically are not found at the shows too much and, therefore are somewhat unsung heroines.
These people are tireless in their efforts for the benefit of the club and breed as a whole and
receive far too little in the way of thanks. I speak of Florence C. Dahlstrom, our wonderful
Treasurer since the founding of the club ten years ago, and Shirley B. Cahill, our editor of the
STCA Newsletter for the past five years. Can't we have more Silky non—show members like
them? Rise ye to the challenge pet owners 1"

Mrs. Grace A. Gates, 5730 SW 56th, Portland, Oregon. "The November 15th, Marysville,
Washington AKC Dog Show was the first show my husband and I had ever attended and also the
first our 7 month old, GATES CHRISTOPHER MARLOW (CHRIS) had ever entered. So we were

of his views I agree with except No. 4. This I must contradict. How often has it been said

"A woman's hair is her crowning glory. " How about the Silky Terrier ? Isn't his coat his
crowning glory also, and how does one keep it beautiful without cleanliness, i. e. , soap and

water ? My dogs are renowned for their beautiful healthy coats, and a weekly bath is a must
whether or not they are exhibited. My advice is: find a good shampoo and stick to it. Regular
grooming counteracts any loss (if any) of oil. . "

"The Sydney Royal Show had 87 Silkies in it. Five of them were Clarkdale dogs. They came out
winning the Best of Breed, Dog Challenge, first, two thirds and one fourth. They were
Clarkdale Wee Sante, Clarkdale Play Boy, Clarkdale Silver Boy, and Clarkdale Caesar. No

bitches were shown. These dogs will be shown again in August in Queensland, and in a few
interstate shows. . . . "

from Miss Eda Field, 18 Edna Grove, East Coburg, N. 13, Vic., Australia — "Last Sunday,
May 3rd, the ACT Silky Terrier and Yorkshire Terrier Club, Canberra, held their first
Championship Show. Some Victorian dogs were exhibited and did very well, and I thought you
readers might be interested in the results. Two Canberra dogs took the Best Baby Puppy and
Best Minor Puppy in Show. Purleemil Kennels' Greengarth Flambeau and C. W. Lancaster's
Kabakaul Miss Kim respectively. Best Junior in Show was Mr. A. Miles' Milan Kelly, while
Mr. and Mrs. G. Hindmarsh won Best Intermediate in Show and Best Limit in Show with
Dachsilk Katrina (Aust. Ch. Milan Tony x Aust. Ch. Langmoor My Bobbykins), and went on to
win Runner—up to Best in Show. My own Aust. Ch. Tamworth Gay Spark (Bouden Blue Firefly x
Tamworth Dark Moon) won the Best Open in Show, the Best Silky Terrier, and the Best Exhibit
in Show, and I can't begin to tell you how pleased I was. It's a long way to go from Melbourne

Mrs. Merle E. Smith (a founder of the Silky Terrier Club of America, erstwhile President,
presently Recording Secretary, and with a license to judge Silky Terrier and Australian. Terriers).
— Peggy was asked to write her comments on the Harbor Cities Kennel Club Show, where she
judged Silky Terriers, and has kindly given us the following remarks useful to all of us,

"All twenty seven entries at the Harbor Cities Kennel Club show on June 20th had correct scissor
bites and the standardization in size 8 to 10 pounds and 9 to 10 inches was very much in evidence,
There were a number with the prevalent faults of bowed fronts, roached toplines, and ears that
were too large, set too low, and rounded at the tips. Two of the class bitches had extremely
undesireable bulbous eyes“ The general quality of the males was quite good, but the bitches were
rather lacking; especially in correct color, Two had a gold cast through their blue and a number
of other were silver, not silver 19313 as called for in the standard. Our standard is quite specific
concerning color and calls for "Blue and Tan" - silver and beige are not acceptable colors. These
undesireable silver body coats are perhaps most vividly described as "white". The lightest blue
described in our standard is silver blue. My interpretation of silver blue is that the body blue
must be dark at the roots to show blue. A silver coat is one that is so light in color that it's
light at the roots,

"The Best of Breed dog, Germany's CH, TINKER BLUE BLAZES, is the darkest of blues,
but definitely not black. His plus features are many, including a level topline, rich color AND
Showmanship. The Best of Winners dog, from the American Bred class, Gettyls MAVROB
SMOKEE, is an extremely typey dog with nice expression, excellent color and topline. These
two, because of their color, heavy line breeding and inbreeding, and the dogs behind them, may
prove useful as studs to improve color.

"My thanks to all exhibitors for a very pleasant assignment. "

THINKING "THANK—YOU" IS ONLY ONE THING . . . the other is putting it in writing or saying it
on the phone. As many of us know, it's exciting to win at a dog show. One ribbon is an invitation to
enter another. More than one ribbon means we've done very well. When one ribbon or more is
augmented by a shiny new trophy, we feel something like Miss, Mrs. , or even Mr. America. But
there's a burr in the coat. How often do we take the time to check the catalog for the name of the
Santa Claus who gave us our trophy ‘? And how often do we take the moment to sit down and write a
note or pick up the receiver and make a call? Of course we are always grateful, but an expression
of that gratitude too often remains unspoken. Perhaps we can take saying ("Thank you" out of the
realm of good intentions for 1964 and make it for real.

y o u s a i d i t . . . a postscript to Alice B. Hively's words quoted in the December Newsletter.
"Matilda" is Mad Manor Matilda, bred by the Morrisons in California. She is the dam of Ch. Shaw's
Sapphire and the grand dam of Ch. Ackline's Samson of Sapphire and Ch. Ackline's Belle of Sapphire.

. . Pat Waber (Mrs. John) of Timber Lane Kennels, 5102 Morningside Drive, Kalamazoo, Michigan
(Phone 345—5228) wrote, on December 12, "I would like you to list the puppies of Silturn Blue Dawn
(Dam) and Clavons Blue Busby (Sire) . . we had a litter of 7! This is Tinker Bell's second litter of
7. We had three females and four males but one of the females died. I would like to list the four
"boys" for sale: Timber Lane Terrific Timmy, Timber Lane Tremendous Tommy, Timber Lane
Tinker's Boy, Timber Lane Tiny Tinker." Pat adds, in a January 10th letter, the names of her two
female pups. They are Timber Lane Sweet Sonja and Timber Lane Sweet Heidi.

Maggi Moore's enthusiasm over Silky Terriers came right out of the pages of her letter which
we quote in part here. "December 29th, our Australian Lylac Lady Pandora and Ch. Silkallure Gino
Mio (owned by Jim and Nancy Lanzarotto) gave us two beautiful little females. My, what adorables
they are. Of course Fred and Susan Stern are just as happy for they will be the great grandparents.
Lylac Lady Pandora is also a daughter of Lylac Penny,whose'daughtur.Lylac Theldy just won B08 in
New South Wales September 15th. These 2 little girls of ours have great lines behind them and have
lots to live up to with that dashing Ch. Silkallure Gino Mio. They will be for sale soon. Oh, best of
all, they were my birthday presentll Ah, yes, Jack Benny and I — §_9_. "

Maggi wrote, further, that she feels that stud owners should be prepared to keep a female a few
days to make a service a probability. She had had two unfortunate experiences that were, as Maggi
points out, "$ experience," apparently neither service was successful and, yet, each had to be paid
for in advance. What is the feeling of you all out there ?

THIS N' THAT.

. . . it isn't summer yet, but . . . your Silky Terriers are probably starting to be outdoor dogs
more often these days. Here's the POISONOUS PLANT list; these plants are dangerous to dogs if

Howard Jensen kindly sent an article, from This Week Magazine, January 26, 1964, "Seven Ways
to Kill. Your Pet" by Marlin Perkins, Director, St. Louis Zoo. "Zoo people long ago learned that
an animal thrives only on food and environment that closely approximates what his ancestors always
had. This simple rule is also a very good one for the nation's 75 million pet owners, too many of
whom are killing their pets with kindness. Here are seven ways I've observed in which some
misguided owners pamper their pets excessively: 1. The perpetual feast: Animals don't know when
to stop eating, and overweight is as bad for them as for you. No matter how soulful he looks, feed
your pet at mealtime——his, not yours. Giving him ice cream and cake is poisoning with kindness.
Teaching birds to enjoy sips of beer or wine is barbarous. 2. The hothouse life: The modern
living you find so comfortable may be bad for your pet. Sudden switches from overheated rooms

to icy streets aren't healthful for him. And air—conditioning, which stirs up drafts, can be harmful,
especially to birds. 3. Perils _o_f travel: Animals need exercise—~even more than humans. A
terrier-sized dog should walk——not ride——two miles a day. As for long—distance travel, domestic
animals are just that——domestic. They'll live longer at home. 4. The bathtub menace: Bathtubs
are a dog's worst enemy, and same goes for most other pets. Soap removes natural oil from the
skin and causes minute cracks which often become infected. 5. Over-petting: Most pets like to

be petted. But some birds interpret such contact as a sign of attack. 6. Over—dressing: When

we put fancy blankets on animals with heavy natural coats, we lower their resistance. Women
don't wear cloth coats over their minks. Furry dogs shouldn't either. 7. Freedom is“. security:
Some liberty—loving Americans think the finest gift they can give a pet is freedom. It isn't. A

pet raised in captivity is not equipped to deal with problems and enemies he meets in a wild state.
The housebroken skunk, deprived of his aromatic weapon, will be defenseless. Birds liberated
inside the house often kill themselves trying to fly through a windowpane . . . "

THE 1964 SPECIALTY

Best we offer a short history of competition to date, especially for new members but to jog the
memories of long timers, too. On August 13, 1960, the first Plan A Sanction Match of the STCA was
held in Los Altos Hills, California; there were 50 entries and 23 competitors; Mrs. Bede Maxwell
judged; Maurie Lady Rita (now Ch. ), owned by the Navarro's was BOB and Bowenvale Blue Boy (now
Ch.) owned by the Van Ettens, was BOS. In 1961, on April 23rd, also at Los Altos Hills, the Second
Plan A Sanction Match was held; there were 43 entries, 25 competitors; Thomas Witcher judged;

BOB was the Layne's Waratah Walkabout (now Ch.) and BOS was the Navarro's Mitry Lady Mandy.

The First Specialty was held in conjunction with the San Mateo Kennel Club Show, November 19,
1961. Judge was Mrs. Virginia Keckler. BOB was the Layne's Ch. Waratah Walkabout, BOS was the
Stern's Ch. Bowenvale Margie. 28 were in competition.

In June, 1962, the Second Specialty was held at the Harbor Cities Kennel Club Show in Long Beach
with Percy Roberts judging. Ch. Billabong Tiny Tim went BOB, Le Roy Shane handler—owner. BOS

March, 1963 saw the Third Specialty, this time at the Oakland Kennel Club Show; Judge was Louis
Murr. BOB was Ch. Bowenvale Blue Boy and BOS Ch. Bowenvale Margie. 43 were in competition.

It is the STCA'S hope that the turnout for the Fourth Specialty will be the greatest yet. The Del
Monte Kennel Club Show will be held on "Sunday, May 24th. The show itself is held next to the
eighteenth fairway of the famous Pebble Beach golf course and beside the Del Monte Lodge. It has
been confirmed that I. Schoenberg will be judging Silky Terriers, for the first time in Northern
California.

So that all of us who are exhibiting may get together and exchange notes and hopes, a dinner has
already been planned, at the Casa Munras Hotel in Monterey, Calif. It will be on Saturday night,
May 23rd, at 8 p. m. A no—host cocktail party, at the same location, will be held between 7 and 8 p. m.
A full course dinner of prime ribs will be $5. 50 per person (tax and tip included). We ask for payment

in advance, by May 1st. We do hope that you can come and join the festivities. Will you fill in the
form below and mail it with your check? More details will be given in the April Newsletter.

Bonnets off to the newest licensed AKC Silky judge: Bev Lehnig, our most capable (and charming,
too) AKC Gazette correspondent, recently received her license to judge our breed — Silky Terriers,
did you know ?

Carmen Canzi reports that his young dog, Ellwyn Prince Glenn, has scored three majors in a row

out of four shows giving him ten points.

New CHAMPIONS — the Moss's Milan Christina (Ch. Milan Tony ex Milan Bambi) finished at the
Oakland Kennel Club Show on March 21st. Dorothy Hicks' Kitty Fair of Cypress (Ch. Redway David
ex Fair Dinkum. Darlene) finished her American championship at Glendale on March 22nd and her
Mexican championship the previous weekend.

YOU SAID IT.

Joan and Harry Wallach (Joan‘s the proud daughter of Harry) "The most popular dog is not the
Silky Terrier, but it could be. Can the Silky Terrier Club members make it so ? HOW CAN WE
HELP put the Silky among the top 10 in the nation ? Who was that dog you saw in a magazine,
newspaper, on a postcard, on TV, in the movies ? It looked like a Silky, but was a Yorkshire.
HOW CAN WE PUBLICIZE THE SILKY ? 1) Newspapers: Send any interesting or unusual anecdote
to the pet editors; they will welcome them. Columnists also welcome such items. 2) Modeling:

A dog is the most photogenic animal for this medium of advertising. Of the toy group the York—
shire is most widely used. Exert your influence to use your Silky if you have any connections with
friends in modeling or advertising agencies. 3) TV Programs: A good medium. And TV
commercials. If you get the breaks for your Silky, think of the residuals you could be amassing.

4) Locally: If you or your wife are active in a social group and are being photographed for a
benefit, by all means have the Silky there. Talk Silky Terriers with friends, relatives, neighbors —
even strangers. Always keep yours well groomed. 5) Expose your Silky to the public — especially
at the Dog Shows. You might be surprised one day to have him wind up a 15 pointer - but even if
he doesn't win, it's good sport, lots of fun, and your dog loves it. With a little effort, we can
increase the popularity and demand for the Silky and have our dogs "working overtime. " ”

Howard Jensen — "On February 8th, Paul Hefner and I had the privilege of meeting Mrs. Lorraine
Waldron of Anchorage, Alaska, to whom we had shipped D'Under Lilibet O'Lover Boy (ex D'Under
Lilibet O'Blue by Ch. Smithfield Lover Boy) in November. He was pictured in a previous News-
letter and is now called Cricket at home. Lorraine - has been a poodle fancier and breeder for
some time. When she got her Silky puppy bitch, Gizmo, she had never seen another Silky. She
acquired another for a friend in Anchorage and then got Cricket from us. . . The Waldrons

Mrs. Frances B. Zugschwerdt, Kingsport, Tennessee. "In looking over the pictures in the News—

Show. Pepe has a silky—textured slate blue coat, a deep tan and good conformation. This now gives
SIR WINSTON his 8th Champion offspring. It makes him the Number One stud dog in Southern
California and ties him for second place in the United States as a producer of Champions. We are
proud to state that SILKA LLURE Silkys have been exhibited in shows throughout the state of California
as well as Arizona, Mexico and N .Y. , meeting the competition wherever it exists. We have always
felt that this is the only way to best determine the true merit of any Silky. "

Kindly enclose a self—addressed, stamped envelope if you want an immediate reply.

THE EYES: Examination of a conscious dog's eyes may be conveniently accomplished by using a
penlight flashlight. It is essential that you make the examination in a dark room where it is quiet
and free from distractions, eyeball movement is minimal, and little or no restraint is needed. The
small, fixed beam of light should reveal any possible foreign particles in the eye or unusual eyelid
conditions. Under no circumstances should one attempt to remove any foreign body from the eye.
It is a most sensitive organ. See your Veterinarian.

 

EYELIDS: Entropion is an inversion of the eyelids. In animals, the lower lids are most commonly
involved, but the condition might also involve the upper lid. Certain breeds of dogs, as chows,
bulldogs, and setters are most frequently affected. Entropion is frequently detected in young dogs,
and it is considered to be an inherited defect.

Symptoms: Entropion causes superficial irritation of the conjunctiva and cornea by the lashes
of the eyelid. The result is swelling, redness, and finally infection with a watery or purulent
secretion. Painful blinking and evidence of light sensitivity can be observed.

Treatment: Treatment only by your Veterinarian is advised. Permanent improvement is
afforded by surgical correction of the lid position.

Ectropion is an eversion of the lower eyelid. It is a common dog eye defect and most frequently
occurs among spaniels, St. Bernards, and bloodhounds. The defect may be hereditary or the re—
sult of faulty healing of a lacerated eyelid.

Symptoms: Ectropion results in inflamation of the conjunctiva and excessive flow of tears
with possible infection of the conjunctival folds.

Treatment: The defect may be corrected by appropriate surgical procedures.

YOU SAID IT .

Mrs. Howard Dean Thomas, 5814 Irving Ave. , La Crescenta, Calif. . . . "Howard and I are so
very proud of our lovely Ch. Silkallure Starbright. He placed 3rd in the Toy Group at the Glendale
Kennel Club show Sunday, 10/11/64. The judge was Mrs. Anna Young. I was pretty proud of
Howard, too, for doing such a marvelous job of handling. Starbright and the Silky breed got a little
publicity this week. The same lovely picture, published in last month's Newsletter, was published
in Francis X. Lahmann's ”Kanine Korner" column, appearing in a number of Southern California
newspapers. He has also talked about Starbright, and his recovery from the brain injury, on his
radio program. . "

Mrs. Bill Williams, Wilhaven Kennels, 1900 Muer Rd., Troy, Mich. . . . "We hope that Harriet
Gill has written you that her Wilhaven Wee Sweet William is now a Champion. (ed. note: yes, see
October Newsletter) He finished in the Labor Day Circuit with a total of 16 points, including 3
majors: 2—5 point shows and 1-3 point show — each time going up from the classes over some very
good Specials, including at least 1 Group winner. "Jolly", as Miss Gill calls him, was a born show-
man with a terrifically good disposition. We are proud about him as he is out of our Ch. Wilhaven
Wee Daisy and Ch. Redway Lord Michael. We own his litter sister Wilhaven Wee Daffodil. She has

HOW EASY TO TRAVEL WITH A SILKY! ! l l l l l i ll

A dog owner who wrote to a hotel requesting reservations for him and his pet received the
following acknowledgement from the manager:

"I have been in the hotel business for 30 years and never have I had to eject a disorderly dog.
Never has a dog set fire to a bed. Never has a dog stolen a towel or a blanket. Your dog is
very welcome. If he will vouch for you, you can come along as well. " "

SUBJECT: The Eyes (continued from November)

Blepharitis (Blef—ar—itis) is the inflamation of the eyelids; this is a common clinical condition
in dogs and other animals. It may occur as a primary disease or as a condition caused by
disease of the conjunctiva or cornea.

 

CAUSES: Bacterial or mite invasion of eyelash and hair folicles at the lid margin are the
common causes of Blepharitis.

SYMPTOMS: The lids become swollen, red and partially denuded; itching and excessive tearing
occurs; crusts of dry purulent (pus) may accumulate at the lid margins; the conjunctive generally
is congested.

TREA TMENT: An antibiotic-hydrocortisone opthalmic ointment provides effective control of
common bacterial invasion of eyelash folicles and is effective in reducing the inflamatory changes
of the eyelids. Daily cleansing of the lids with a 3%‘soluti‘on of sodium bicarbonate or similar
eye wash and cold compresses are required. Local anesthetic opthalmic preparations will
relieve itching. When mites are identified as the cause of Blepharitis, an opthlamic ointment
containing 3% of rotenone is effective in killing these parasites.

 

Diseasg 9f the Lacrimal (tear) Apparatus: Inflamation of the lacrimal gland is rare. The
lacrimal sac may become inflamed with an accumulation of pus and excessive tearing, (Epiphora).
This condition is relieved with antibiotic eye drops.

In Stenosed (constricted) tear ducts the lacrimal sac swells and may rupture. Symptoms are
chronic tearing (Epiphora) causing staining of hair below the eyes, and mild conjunctivitis.
Treatment by a specialist on dogs' eyes is recommended. The dilation of tear ducts by probing
and irrigation are the usual procedures.

before but; even a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Autos and other dogs are always around.

HOW T O GE T INTO THE NEWS . o . or doyoufeel leftout? or neglected?
or pushed ? rudely overlooked ? generally out of sorts ? RX: just send your news, pictures. into the
Post Office Box. We'll print anything printable and that means just about everything we have ever
received. We pant for your local Silky happenings, for true stories, for recent litters. for anything
you would like to have discussed. And, by the way, we are always open to suggestion. Isnlt that

the way progress is made ? ? ? ? In other words, let 1964 be the year we hear from YOU: often and
honestly.

Lucille Preston, Hollywood, Calif. "Many thanks for printing Ch. Koolamina Aussie's picture, but
Julian wants to know if it can't be changed to read: "Owned by Lucille Preston!" And I wonder if

the caption shouldn't read: "that TIRED eX-secetary of the Southern California Silky Terrier Club. "”
(ed. note: seems a reasonable request from a husband).

Howard Cockrill, Little Rock, Arkansas. ". . Until last month I had never seen nor heard of this
breed. Upon being introduced to "Angel, " I immediately fell in love with her and the whole family
has followed suit. Frankly, however, she is a typical Woman: having conquered me, she
immediately jilted me for my wife and daughters. . . "

Karen A. Haes, Saint Paul, Minnesota. "Thank you very much for the application and invitation to
join the Silky Terrier Club of America. I am very pleased to join, as it was through the information
you sent to me that I was able to obtain such an adorable Silky pup. I will be looking forward to
receiving the monthly Newsletter and want to thank STCA for information put out by them which
enabled me to get in touch with a breeder; I could find no one in this area able to help me. A big
vote of thanks to you and your Club. . . "

returning your call

We received so many thoughtful remarks by mail in response to January's ”you said it" column,

as it concerned stud service, that we have elected to sum up the points of View of the several stud
owners who wrote in. The following are offered as objective guide lines for your possible use.
However, it will. please you to know that breeders both think and feel, as evidenced by their letters.

1. Both stud and bitch should be free of fleas.

2. Stud service contracts should always be used and should always
be signed by both parties.

3. Stud fees should be paid in advance, in full.
The owner of the bitch should know the exact time her dog came
in season.
Arrangements satisfactory to both stud and bitch owner should be
made in advance of the initial service, should include the possibility
that the service will be unsuccessful, the number of further services
at no charge, and whether the stud fee will be refunded.
The stud owner should be advised, by the bitch owner, if a breeding
is unsuccessful.

Each stud owner has the privilege of interpreting generally accepted
rules of breeding.

All for now, your ed.

s. b. Cahill

YOU SAID IT .

Betty Young writes that she has theseﬁlps for sale. "First, by our Ch. Clavons Blue Rain ex
Ch. Alcarlou Lady Suzanne, two males and two females whelped February 16, 1964, names as
follows: Larrakin Dapper Dandy, Larrakin Debonair David, Larrakin Dainty Dixie, Larrakin
Delightful Deborah. Suzie believes in getting her young'uns off to a good start -—- birth weights
of theseuf'our pups were 6, 6—1/2, 7, and 7—1/2 ounces each. Heaviest we had had before were
6 ounces. Does anyone besides me keep records of birth weights of puppies ? I'd like to com-
pare notes with them if they do. . . Not to be outdone by Suzie, our Redway Bonnie Lass
whelped her litter, also sired by Ch. Clavons Blue Rain, six days later on February 22nd.
Their names: Larrakin Little Lochinvar, Larrakin Lucky Lance, Larrakin Lovely Lacey,
Larrakin Larrupin' Lizzie. . . . With our Silkys all being beloved house pets, we have one
mama with babies occupying one of our two bedrooms with bath, and the other mama and pups
in the other bedroom and bath! Jim (Mr. Young) and I just have to manage the best way we can,
sharing the small remaining part of our home with Rainy, Muffin, and 2-1/2 month old Rowdy.
It's fun, even though we do get to feeling a little addled at times as to who has been fed, had
calcium, had vitamin supplement, etc. I (ed. note: so that the Youngs may be able to have a
people type in their guest room this year, why don't you write them at 1917 Spring Street, Little
Rock, Arkansas ? (if you've been wanting a Silky pup)

Margaret Danback, of San Lorenzo, California, writes: ". . This suggestion may be of interest
to members around the country. While out shopping for dog beds that would be easy to keep
clean, smooth, discouraging to fleas, and ones that would not be chewed by puppies, my husband
bought bathtubs for babies. They are ideal — heavy plastic — and are more reasonable in price
than the usual dog bed or basket. The walls of the tubs stop drafts and our dogs enjoy sleeping

in them. Very colorful too. I laughed when he walked in with them instead of metal ones, but
it turned out to be an excellent idea. . . "

THIS N' THAT .

Al and Jean Vaughn, of Pets Inn, Inc. , 225 Potrero Ave. , San Francisco, UN 3—1597, advise
that an 8-week obedience course will be starting soon. The fee is $10. 00 for members of the
STCA. You may choose between Monday or Tuesday evenings at 7 :30 p. m.

Peggy Smith has sent us a word on W. A. Wheatland's book "The Australian Terrier and The
Australian Silky Terrier. " It is recommended as excellent. A check for $4. 00 will cover the
cost of receiving one by air mail and $2. 00 covers surface mail. Surface mail takes six to
seven weeks. Mr. Wheatland is one of Australia's most respected all—breed judges with
experience in both Australian and Silky terriers.

Westminster results: five in competition — BOB to Earl's Ch. Milan Miss Sandra of Iradell

and B08 to Buchanan & Richardson's Buchrich Dapper Dan. MISS SANDRA WENT ON TO GROUP

putting the Silky Terrier in the limelight!)

survived the quake, but their Silky Terriers were somewhat distrustful of them for some time
afterward. Cricket (D'Under Lilibet O'Lover Boy) flew out the open door and wouldn't come in
for some time afterward, having to be coaxed. Gizmo was in her crate and received a good
shaking up. Their home remained intact, but her husband's plant collapsed on the office build—
ing. He worked with emergency rescue squads, using his construction cranes to lift debris and
raze dangerous buildings. Humor came forth and Anchorage citizens are claiming to have the
most modern city in the world --— split level. They slept in front of the fireplace and had water
and gasoline enough, but are having somewhat of a sewer problem. Lorraine was good in spirit
in her letter — recieved last week — and said there's nothing at present that they need. . "

Fran and George Van Etten announce an excellent addition to their breeding stock in Australian
Champion Bowenvale Coralee. She should also offer competition in the show ring. (ed. note:
welcome to the ranks, and to the USA ’1)

WHEN, IF, YOU MOVE . . . please let the STCA know, via the Post Office Box.

Artarmon—Santa Rosa Kennels, 6065 Old Redwood Highway, Santa Rosa, California are owned by
Jim and Henri moss. (Your ed. has had the privilege of leaving her dogs there and know the
Mosses as really fine members of the STCA, not to mention the fact that they're hard working
breeders, exhibitors, and carers for other people's dogs). A note from them, requested after
their fine win at the Oakland Show (mentioned previously in the Newsletter), offers the following
information: "Ch. Smithfield Lover Boy (since being in the USA): 16 shows entered —- 7 Best of
Breed (no BOB to Opposite Sex), 6 shows since being a Champion and has taken 5 BOB. Gained
his Championship at Richmond Dog Fancier's Club, Richmond, California, on 6—16—63. Shown at
all shows by Miss Betty Britt. Ch. Milan Christina (since being in the USA): 22 shows entered -
in addition to minor placings coming through the ranks, 8 Best of Breed to Opposite Sex. Gained
her Championship at the Oakland Kennel Club Show on March 21, 1964. ”

Lee and Julia Shane of the Southern California Silky Terrier Club write: ”We read with amusement
and a bit of ”tongue in cheek" about the Silkies who turned on the TV, but it also happened to us when
Tiny Tim was in the den and the TV came on loud and strong. We think he got up to it and turned

it on as his paw came down. Wouldn't you know, he had a Western on ? Don't know about the others,
but Tiny Tim and Lil Pearl sat transfixed at Disney’s "Gypsy Dog" picture on in color Sunday,

two weeks ago. They didn't take their eyes off the screen until it was over (except during the

commercial), and apparently enjoyed it hugely. Wonder if the color makes them notice TV
more ?. . "

Alicia Hanschman - "Of all the dogs photographed for publicity purposes, for the Oakland Dog
Show, held March 21, 1964, one little Silky Terrier was amongst them. His picture appeared in
the San Francisco Chronicle, Monday, March 16. His name is Mabrouka Eamonn, UD, still the
only Silky Terrier with the PhD degree from Obedience. We thank the Chronicle for using the
Silky breed. There Were over 30 Silky Terriers at the show. We wish to thank Helen Rosemont
Burkett for making it a good day — she was the Show Superintendent. . "

Fred and Susan Stern — "Silkallure Starfire has won his Championship, pending AKC confirmation,

with a five—point BOB at Glendale, March 22nd. This is Sir Winstons 4th Champion and Bowenvale
Margie's 3rd. "

Carmen Cananzi, Midland Silky Terrier Kennels, 465 Ohio Ave. , Midland, Pa. , advises that he
has two pups for sale. Sire: Ch. Ellwyn Prince Tuffy, Dam: Ch. Lylac Jan. He advises, further:
” . . they have a very good coat at the age of 6 weeks, their ears are already halfway up. They
are a very nice black and tan, have well shaped heads and perfect bodies. Their names: Ellwyn
Billy of Midland and Ellwyn Linny of Midland. . "

Margaret Danback . . . ”A handy item to keep dogs separated for various reasons is a folding
gate. One can buy them at almost any department store. They are high enough to prevent a dog
from jumping over the top, are sturdy, and have a strong clasp . . they should work well for

members who are home owners and apartment dwellers . "

WHAT YOUR FELLOW MEMBERS SAW

from: Fran Van Etten, President. Silky Terrier Club of America (Los Altos) , . , .

Our Fourth Specialty Show is now gone but. truly, not forgotten. The words - "a great success",
"a good judge". "a grand get together", and "a job well done" - still ringing in our ears -— give me
this pleasant opportunity to extend congratulations to all our officers. members and supporters. as
well as winners and losers of our Specialty held at the Del Monte Lodge in Pebble Beach, Calif. .

May 24. 1964.

Our special thanks go to those behind—the—scenes workers who put forth every effort to make another
Specialty an outstanding event. May I remind you that we owe sincere appreciation to the efforts of
our Banquet Co—ordinator. Mr. Harry Wallach, and his Assistant. Mrs. Shirley Cahill, for
handling all preparations for the Get-to-gether Dinner held at the Casa Munras Hotel in Monterey,
Calif. The Cocktail Hour! The Door Prizes! The Surprise Gifts? For all aboard. these were
outstandingly successful. and the dinner menu was SUPERB! It again gave an opportunity to make

new friends and enjoy old friends as well.

Last - BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST — we thank our officers: Vice President. Laurel Gilbertson;

Corresponding Secretary, Dolly Navarro; Recording Secretary, Mrs. Merle Smith; Treasurer,
Mrs. Ture Dahlstrom; Trophy Chairman, Mr. Ernest Hanschman. A JOB WELL DONE.

from: Howard Jensen, first Newsletter Editor. often exhibitor (San Francisco) . . . .
Success of the Specialty was mainly attributable to those who supported it with their entries. Special
thanks are due those coming great distances; Bev Lehnig coming all the way from Jeffersonville,

Indiana.

Grace Callen. Paul Hefner and I enjoyed conversing with the Shanes, the Kominics. the Feas and the
Hayes from Southern California. What terrific Silky boosters the Kominics were with the litter in
the exercise pen and their willingness to talk Silky with anyone evincing the slightest interest. Those
pictures stackedbeside the pen were superb 2! “How many of us did this in the past when we first be-
came Silky owners. but are now more in'te.v=.‘ested in talking with one another, instead of educating

the public and boosting the breed" Fred Stern is one who has; never lost this enthusiasm though.

What a trophy 3

We had a variety of sizes. colors and conformations from which Judge Schoenberg had to choose ——
a typical. show where a large Silky entry is present. He scrutinized each Silky most thoroughly,
whether it was small, large, dark or light. giving each exhibitor more opportunity to gait his dog

way to attempt to advise judges what color or size he should seek in a breed which just five years
ago could range from 6 to 12 pounds. could and can still be from slate blue to silver blue. AKC
supplies the judges with the standards and he will judge as best as he sees fit.

We were surprised to see some professionals come between their exhibits and the judge. A novice
can be expected to do this until an experienced exhibitor tips him off (the reason this is being
discussed here). Ring veterans should recall the days they first entered the ring and be glad to pass
on ring procedure to the novice in a spirit of good sportsmanship and willingness to see him come
up. with betterment of the breed being the result in a long run. Explain entry forms, classes to
enter. proper handling. ring procedures. wins, etc. It is a matter of empathy and comity between

the Newsletter so much. Would like to see more articles such as Mrs. Germany's about breeding

to the Standard. No wonder judges are confused with all the different sizes, colors, types, etc.

It takes time to "shake down" a new breed, and we realize it is only 5 years since we were recog—
nized by the AKC, but serious and dedicated breeders, of which there are a few should begin to

exert more influence over the neophytes or all of us will lose out. We should all recognize our
particular problem in each of our kennels and work hard to correct major faults -— particularly of
size and color. Many of us need better breeding stock. If we lack a good foundation bitch, a good
stud won't help too much. If we own a good stud, we should refuse to breed to a poor quality bitch. . "

Karen Canaday, P. O. Box 203, Forks, Wash. 98331 . . . "All my Silkies are thriving in this
climate and dampness has done wonders for the dry skin and coat that they all suffered from in San
Diego. We have just moved to Washington on the Olympic peninsula and I am looking forward to
meeting any and all Silky owners in this neck of the woods. . . "

Mrs. Lester B. Cohen, 10037 Gerald Ave. , Sepulveda, Calif. (who has submitted a crossword
puzzle to the Newsletter) . . "Our puppy, Silkallure Falstaff, will become a full—fledged dog this
Saturday when he celebrates his first birthday. Since it has been our habit to call him by saying,
"Here, puppy, " it just won't seem right to say ”Here, dog. " I think that the best thing about Silkies
is that, in temperament, they remain puppies forever . . "

Mrs. William Lehnig, Rebel Kennels, R. R. 3, Box 576, Jeffersonville, Indiana 47130 (Bev, as
many of you know, is Coordinator of the forthcoming STCA Specialty in Chicago and also writes

the splendid column on Silky Terriers for the AKC Gazette) ". . We took our Rebel Blue Bugle
Boy (Taps) and our Rebel Kissin' Angel (Muriel) to a Fun Match at Bloomington, Indiana on October
25th. Best of breed was awarded to the best puppy in each breed and to the best Open dog in each
breed. Then Muriel competed in the Puppy Toy Group where she placed second, and Taps com—
peted in the Open Toy Group in which he placed fourth. Even though this was just: a Match and in
itself not too important, we were very happy because this is the first time our Silkys have ever been
given any consideration in a Match. Heretofore, the judges at Matches haven't seemed to know what
they were so we feel that now the Silky Terrier is really being recognized by other dog people.
Incidentally, Muriel is four months old, and Taps is eleven months. Taps and Muriel are both
"children" of Ch. Redway Buster. Taps' mama is Rebel Lady Lollipop, and Muriel's mom is Rebel
April Angel. " (ed. note: not only first—class wins, but A—l names)

 

Part II. "COMMENTS ON MODE OF COLOR INHERITANCE IN SILKY TERRIERS" by Betty Young -
in response to Mary Germany's comments about variations in color and type in the August News-
letter.

"The longer I breed, the more I think that breeding theories, like rules, are at times "made to
be broken, " but it does behoove all of us to study breeding principles in general. Breeding prin—
ciples as specifically applied to our breed are difficult to find in print. For instance, I searched
for over two years to discover the mode of inheritance of coat color in Silky Terriers. I wrote
breeders of Silkys here and in Australia, geneticists, and even (in desperationl) a Yorkie breeder.
Many genetics books set forth the mode of color inheritance in Cookers, Dachshunds, Beagles and
various bird dogs — even in Chows, which are not really numerous, but I found only one book which
deals with color transmission in our or a related breed. This is Dr. C. C. Little s book, Th__e_
Inheritance _o_f Coat Color _i_n Dogs (now, unfortunately, out of print), which sets forth the manner
of color inheritance in Yorkshire Terriers, which I believe is applicable with only slight modifi—
cations to our Silky Terriers.

"From information gained from breeders, it appears that two facts on color are established
from practical experience. One is that mating together of two black (at maturity) and tan specimens
will always produce black body coats. The other is that continued mating of light silver blue with
tan specimens will eventually produce the too-light, almost-white body coats which usually have
beige or cream instead of rich tan points. This practical information seems to bear out the theory
on Yorkie color inheritance expressed in Dr. Little's book.

"Blue in many breeds are from recessive genes, and are easily fixed in the breed. Since a dog
showing a recessive trait, in this case blue, must be pure for the recessive in order to show it
(viz. , having inherited the recessive from both his sire and his dam), he can throw only the re-
cessive gene to his offspring. Thus if only blue specimens of these breeds are mated, only blue
offspring will result. Puppies in these breeds are born blue. This recessive gene is called the gene
for dilution (of black) by most geneticists. Blue Chows, Great Danes, Greyhounds, and Dobermans

are in this group, However, in Yorkshire, Bedlington, and Kerry Blue Terriers (and I believe in
Silky Terriers as well), the inheritance of color is much more complicated and difficult to control,
These breeds are born black, or black and tan, and attain the blue gradually as the dogs mature,
In Silkys, mature color is seldom attained before the age of 18 months, and some of the darker
specimens may remain mostly black till they are 2—1/2 or 3 years of age; some of these will blue at
the later age, while some simply remain black, If much silvering occurs at an early age, the dog
will. usually, though not always, be too light at maturity. Dr, Little ascribes the blue in these
breeds to a graying gene which appears to be at least partly dominant and changes a puppy born a
dark color in the direction of increasing grayness or paleness, Silkys also carry the genes for black
and tan saddle patter (also called black with tan points), and probably the chinchilla (or paling) gene
also, which is more active on tan areas of the coat, He states that the degree of dominance is con-
trolled by some as yet unknown modifying factor acting on the graying gene, Dr, Little also states:
"It may be that the more desirable shades of blue are found in Gg animals (that is, those which con-
tain one dominant for graying and one recessive for non-graying gene in the pair obtained from
their parents.) If this is the case, black (gg) animals will continue to appear, and they can be
crossed with light blues to get intermediate shades of blue coat color by incomplete dominance of
G (the graying gene), " He also notes that much more experimentation needs to be done for further
0 one lus ions 0

"As Mary Germany says, "The standard for every breed is written for a purpose, " If appears
from the somewhat slim genetic information I have obtained that there is indeed good reason for our
standard providing for variation in shades of blue from silver blue to very dark (slate) blue, since
otherwise we might see our blues turn to black from use of too much dark breeding stock, or to
white from too much light breeding stock. " (Part III, December issue)

AND SOMETHING FOR THANKSGIVING . , . A Dog's Prayer by Beth Norman, 19418o

 

"Treat me kindly, my beloved master, for no heart in all the world is more grateful for kindness
than the loving heart of me, Do not break my spirit with a stick, for though I should lick your hand
between blows, your patience and understanding will more quickly teach me the things you would
have me do. Speak to me often, for your voice is the world's sweetest music, as you must know by
the fierce wagging of my tail when your footstep falls upon my waiting ear, When it is cold and wet,
please do take me inside, for I am a domesticated animal, no longer used to bitter elements, and
I ask no greater glory than the privilege of sitting at your feet beside the hearth, though had you no
home, I should prefer to follow you through ice and snow, rather than rest upon the softest pillow
in the warmest home in all the land, Keep my pan filled with. fresh water, for although I should not
reproach you were it dry, I cannot tell you when I suffer thirst, Feed me clean food, that I may
stay well, to romp and play and do your bidding, to walk by your side, and stand ready, willing
and able to protect you with my life should your life be in danger. And, master, when I am very
old, if the Great Master sees fit to deprive me of my health and sight, do not turn me away from
you, rather take my trusting life gently, and I shall leave you, knowing with my last breath I draw,
my fate was always safest in your hands. "

JULY, 1964

SILKY TERRIER CLUB OF AMERICA NEWS.

at the monthly meeting, June 25th

a vote of the majority decided that a picture of a Silky Terrier would not appear on the cover of
future copies of the Standard.

Mrs. William Lehnig (Bev, who writes the excellent column for the "AKC Gazette" and whom
many readers met at the Fourth Specialty) was appointed Specialty Coordinator for 1965. Plans
are underway for a location in the Midwest for the Fifth Specialty.

the next STCA meeting will be on July 30th, 8 p. m. , Lake Merced, San Francisco. The Center

is adjacent to the Harding Park Golf Course. Enter Harding Road from Skyline Boulevard where
the sign says "Lake Merced. "

NEW MEMBERS . . . Mr. Lester B. Cohen, Sepulveda, Calif., Mr. David Campbell, Little Rock,
Ark., Mr. M. J. Poimiroo, Hillsborough, Calif., and Mr. & Mrs. R. A. Getty, Los Angeles,
Calif. This brings us up to a mid-year total of 298 members.

NEW CHAMPIONS: Two bred by our fine "Popular Dogs" columnist, Betty Young: Burlingame's
LARRAKIN YOUNG JAMIE (Ch. Clavons Blue Rain ex Alcarlou Lady Suzanne) and Waber's
LARRAKIN SWEET SASSA FRAS (same breeding). Another new champion is the Pesa's
ACKLINE'S JOY OF SAPPHIRE. Her two littermates, Ch. Ackline's Samson of Sapphire and
Ch. Ackline's Belle of Sapphire have already finished — so this is the FIRST ALL CHAMPION
SILKY LITTER bred in the U. S. Congratulations to their breeder, Edna Ackerman, their sire
Ch. Redway Lord Michael (this making him the top sire in the country with NINE champion get)
and their dam, Ch. Shaw's Sapphire. Cananzi's ELLWYN PRINCE (Ch. Ellwyn Prince Tuffy ex
Ch. Lylac Jan) recently completed his championship at 11 months of age.

Y O U S A I D I T (and your STCA is grateful)

Howard Jensen, San Francisco, Calif. - "I'm wondering how many owners are experiencing
blindness in their Silkies and at what age. . . Does it seem to be more prevalent in bitches ?
It is not cataracts (in his experience) but more of a film in the back part of the eye. Loss of
sight causes nervousness in the dog because he must rely on hearing and smell and he startles

more easily when vision diminishes. Perhaps you might ask this in the Newsletter - to see if
others will write in . . "

Lorraine Waldron, Anchorage, Alaska — "I've been wanting to write and let you know how the
Silkies in Alaska were doing. We certainly have been busy. We had our show on May 10th as
scheduled, although in a different location than planned, since the building we usually use had
been damaged in the earthquake. Our female, "Blue Chantilly" (by Hatfield Gaybeau ex Gold
Star Blue Jane) known as "Gizmo" at home, won Best of Breed and placed fourth in the Group
under Judge Vincent Perry! Our young male "D'Under Lilibet O'Loverboy" (by Ch. Smithfield
Loverboy ex D'Under Lilibet O'Blue) was shown in Junior Showmanship by my 12-year old
daughter, Leslie, and they placed first in Novice "A" - in a large class. "Cricket" showed like
a little trouper and acted like he really enjoyed it. It was his first time in the ring. Leslie is

OU SAID IT..

Martha W. Sutcliffe, Kanimbla Kennels, Charlotte. North Carolina - "I am happy to advise that
KANIMBLAS' BENDIGO BENNIE has received his Certificate of Championship No. 17872 dated
May 30. 1964 from the American Kennel Club. "Bimbo". owned and bred by Mrs. Martha
Sutcliffe. finished at Cincinnati Kennel Club going Best of Winners for three points under Judge
James Trullinger. He was handled by Everett Thorn at midwestern shows starting with a four
point major at Hoosier Kennel Club at Indianapolis. . "

Mary V. Germany . . ". . may I take this opportunity to make a comment ? I am relatively new
in Silkies, (CH. TINKER BLUE BLAZES. "Brutus" is my first) but I am by no means new to dog
breeding and exhibiting. I am a breeder of miniature Wirehaired Dachshunds and the owner of the
top—winning miniature Wirehair Dachshund in. the U. S. for two straight years . . these wins are
not to be taken lightly. as it has only been since I’ve been showing my bitch (3 years) that minia-
tures have been looked at by judges . . Seems I must be a glutton for punishment since I am now
in a. breed that is new to judges and public alike and will need a lot of publicity as well as exhibition
of fine specimens to win their share of groups and group placements. (I don't mention BIS's as

we must crawl before we can walk, and even a miniature Wirehair Dachshund or a miniature of
any coat has yet to have a BIS). I must get on with it now. and that is the MATTER OF COAT
COLOR IN SILKIES. Since most of the Silky breeders are relatively new to dogs as well. as to
their breed. may I please implore them to carefully read the Standard concerning coat color,
memorizing it, breeding for it. and too. above all. not to settle for second best merely because
they cannot come up with "Silver-blue. pigeon—blue, or slate-blue; tan deep. rich, etc. " The
Standard for every breed is written for a purpose. If breeders begin to set up their own "standards",
then it doesn't take long for a breed to disintegrate. So follow the Standard's teachings. Also for
type. I have talked to numerous judges of Silkies. and found that almost without exception their
comments have been "If I have an entry of 25. I find almost a dozen or more different types and
colors. " Granted that the breed. in a relatively short time. has come a long way. but it has even
longer to go before the majority of an entry will be equal in size. color. conformation and
temperament. Until such time as the serious breeder steps in and literally boycotts the "get-
rich—quick" puppy mill breeder. the breeder who can tell the uninformed public and novice exhibitor
anything. then the Standard is soon going to become a passe thing and will. undoubtedly, end up

by being rewritten so that it will more nearly conform to the Silky that is being currently shown

NEW MEMBERS .

Miss Georgette Pauwels, So. El Monte, Calif., Mrs. Lucille M. Voight, Elmhurst, 111.,

Mrs. Robert F. Cline, Ridgecrest, Calif., Mr. James W. Green, Richmond, Calif., Mrs.
Mary Huson, So. San Francisco, Calif., Mrs. Elizabeth J. Lyon, Ventura, Calif., Mrs. L. J.
Tripodi, Lake Milton, Ohio, Mrs. Nancy Lanzarotta, Long Beach, Calif., and Mrs. James R.
Offutt, Fayetteville, Ark.

WE'RE WITH YOU . . . . all Silky owners would want to let the Whitmores know this at this time.
The Whitmores recently had their home gutted by fire, lost Garona Blue Boy, Greengarth Blue
Bonny, and their five week old litter of four pups.

A VERY IMPORTANT P. S. . . . to our 1963 Silky Statistics — Elsa Vinisko's brace of Ch.
Elmikeis Lady Elfin Queen and Ch. Elmike's Lady Elsa became the first Silky Brace to go Best
Brace in Show at the Sussex Hills K. C. in November.

Phyllis Buchanan & Suzanne Richardson report a Group *I‘hi‘nti for their Ch. Buchrich Spaka at
the Penn Treaty show.

yearly ”I‘opular Dogs" magazine subscriptions are still available to members of the STCA at
a reduced rate of $2. 00 per year. Send your $2. 00 check, payable to the STCA, to the P. O.
Box. An informative and entertaining column on Silky Terriers is offered monthly by Mrs.
Jim Young of Little Rock, Arkansas.

T H I S N" T H A T . . . with the Specialty and many other shows in the offing, it seems
timely to remind exhibitors old and new of Silky coat care, and put up the W A R N I N G light.
Oil preparations, used indiscriminately, can mean T R O U B L E with a capital "T"! Oils
change the coat color to ALL dark with no contrasts and, worst of all, change the texture to
icky—gooey—greasy—grundy—P. U. instead of S I L K Y.

Oil preparations are swell, for two reasons: 1) to get mats out of a dogs coat before bathing
(work the oil into the mats and leave for a few hours - then work the mats apart with your
fingers) 2) as a coat conditioner for the weeks or days before a bath.

now training him in Obedience work and he is doing very well. We will show them both again in
November .

"In April, "Gizmo" had a California vacation. We sent her to the James Mosses in Santa
Rosa to be bred to Ch. Smithfield Loverboy. Last Monday. she presented us with 5 boys! They
are beautiful and very strong and healthy. So you can see we have been busy. I hope we can
have an entry in the next Specialty. We would have this time. but things were just too hectic
after the 'quake.

"1 really enjoy the Newsletter. I don't feel quite so far away and out of touch with the
rest of you. plus the good information you print really helps.

"The picture you printed in the June issue - of me and "D'Under Blaze Away" — was taken
in February, when I visited Howard Jensen in San Francisco. The puppy. "Blaze. " is Howard's
— not mine — but she is a litter sister to my "Cricket. " It was the first time I had met Howard.
although we had been corresponding for some time. I had a wonderful time. and got to see many
Silkies . . . " (ed. note — thanks, Lorraine. for an entertaining and informative letter)

Mae Holt — suggests that people living in Southern California might like to contact her Veterinarian
for his "cure" for summer exzema. He’s Dr. Winchester in Westminster. Mae says he's given
her something to put in her dog's food and it‘s worked wonders.

Mrs. Lester B. Cohen, Sepulveda. Calif. ". .I was delighted to find Pat 'Waber’s address in the
January issue. Our puppy. Silkallure Falstaff. won-a trophy donated by her in the Specialty. and
we had wanted to write her a thank-you note. but didn't have her address.

"The Specialty was not only the first show Taffy was entered in. but also the first show
we had ever attended. It was a wonderfully exciting experience. We especially enjoyed the dinner
Saturday night and the opportunity to meet the other Silky people who were so nice to us.

"One thing puzzles us. as new owners of a fairly new breed. and that is the color standard
for the breed. We intend to purchase a female soon. and don’t exactly know what to look for in
that regard. We have attended three dog shows. At the first . . a light. very silver blue dog
won Best of Breed. At the second. a dog that I would call slate blue won BOB. and at the third
one that I would call black won. Three different judges were involved. of course . . . but how
are we to know what standard to try for. I have asked this question of several people. but none
seemed to know the answer . . would appreciate some enlightenment before we make our pur—
chase of a female. " (ed. note: see Peggy Smith's comments on the recent Harbor Cities Kennel
Club show — they should clear your. and others' questions up)

Mrs. Thorn Kuhl. Birmingham. Michigan- Mrs. Kuhl enclosed a photo of Connie Hines ("Mr.
Ed". CBS. Sundays) shown with her "Australian" Silky Terrier. The clipping came from the
"Detroit Free Press, " a weekly magazine. She remarks . . "As you can see Connie Hines
is pictured with her Silky with a RIBBON on its hair. Isn’t that a breach of Silky etiquette .
Possibly one of the Southern California members in or around Los Angeles might know Miss
Hines and pass along the good word to her — - or perhaps Raymond Burr would do the honors .

Mrs. George E. Pesa. Youngstown, Ohio — ". . I would like to let you know that our little Silky.
Ackline's Joy of Sapphire. finished her Championship on May 23. 1964 at Butler. Penna. It has
been confirmed by AKC. She was sired by Ch. Redway Lord Michael . . We bought our Silky
about a year and a half ago. from Mrs. Edna Ackerman, and were so thrilled with her that we
decided to breed her. She gave us a litter of three puppies, two females and one male. We
were going to sell all three of them. but when it came time to let them go we couldn't part with
them. We kept the two females and sold the male to very close friends. We love Silkys and

will probably end up with a house full before we're finished. "

Geri and Ed Kominic. Ger-Edis Kennels. South Gate. California — "Enclosing a glossy picture
of my two darlings. who won their class at our Fourth Specialty in Pebble Beach. Before I de-
scribe the picture. I want to thank everyone in Northern California Silky Club for one of the most
wonderful weekends Eddie and I have ever had. We are new to this Silky hobby. our four Silkies
are our life. and to be around fifty beautiful Silkies would constitute a beautiful weekend.

"I also want to take this opportunity to thank Mr. and Mrs. R. Navarro for the beautiful
trophy 1st in Bred by Exhibitor - also the Kealoha Kennels for the trophy 1st in Puppy Bitches
9 to 12. We juSt received them back from the engraver. We are very proud of them. Maybe
