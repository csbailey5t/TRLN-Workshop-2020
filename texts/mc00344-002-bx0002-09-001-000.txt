Dear Ms. Nagel:

Thank you for your letter of concern for animals used in laboratories.
I have received quite a bit of mail on this issue from people all over the
the country. It is gratifying to see how many people share my concern for
animals used in research and testing.

After the Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Technology, of which
I am the Ranking Republican, held hearings on this subject 13—14 October
1981, our staff has been working on legislation that will govern all

.animal testing and research sponsored by the federal government. It is our
aim to not only improve the humane treatment of animals used in research
and testing, but to significantly increase federal support for the develop-
ment of non-animal research and testing methodologies. Our legislation
will improve the peer review system in order to reduce to a minimum the
number of improper or unnecessary research projects.

I am very pleased to report that the bill will require that a person
not affiliated with the research institution be a member of the animal
care committees currently overseeing the nation's research facilities.
This will be the first time non-research personnel will have had a voice
in animal care procedures on these important committees. In addition,
individuals involved in research projects are required to report violations
of animal welfare regulations to the federal government if the institution
supervising the work fails to respond to complaints.

I feel this bill combines the best of all the legislation that came
before my subcommittee. The bill has passed the Subcommittee on Science,
Research, and Technology and is expected to go before the full Committee
on Science and Technology within the next few weeks. Our staff has been
working closely with a number of animal care organizations to ensure that
their concerns have been addressed.

Dear Mr. Hofer:

Thank you for your letter concerning H.R. 66, legislation to dis~
courage the use of painful devices in the trapping of animals.

Representative Anderson has reintroduced H.R. 66 as H.R. 6651,
which I am cosponsoring. The use of devices such as the steel-
jaw, leghold trap, represent, in my View, a complete disregard
by the trapper for humane treatment of wild animals. There are
many other methods that could be used by trappers which would

not infliCt pain, or torture these animals in the manner that
these traps do. ;w~ v‘

The bill is currently in the Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wild—.
life Conservation of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries.

Please be assured that should the bill come to the floor of the
House, I will give it my full and active support.

Thank you for writing me about HR 66, to outlaw leghold traps.

This bill completed hearings before the Subcommittee on Merchant
Marine and Fisheries of the Interior Committee, and no markup by the
Committee has been scheduled yet.

Should it come up before the House for a vote, I will certainly
support it.

Best wishes.

Dear Mr. Mountain:

Thank you for your letters of February 14
in support of H. R. 5808, the Animal Welfare Act
Amendments, and H. R. 66, regarding the humane trap—
ping of animals.

As you may know by now, the House approved
H. R. 5808 on February 9, by a vote of 335 to 34. I
voted for this bill. Also, the House agreed to the
amendment offered by Congresswoman Heckler, to require
Federal agencies to comply with humane standards with
respect to laboratory animals.

The House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Sub-
committee on Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation and
the Environment has held hearings on H. R. 66, and a
number of related proposals. As one of several co-
spohsors of this measure in the House, I expect to
supportmthewlegislationion.the House Floor, should it

”be"?eported favorably by the Committee.

Thank you for your communication in support of H.R. 66 which would
restrict the use of steel-jaw, leghold traps.

H.R. 66, was referred to the Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife
Conservation and the Environment of the House Merchant marine and
Fisheries Committee where hearings were held on November 17 and 18,
1975. On the Senate side, a similar bill, S. 1223 was referred to the
Subcommittee on the Environment of the Senate Commerce Committee where
it is pending.

At this point, I cannot predict what the final action of the House or
Senate will be with regard to this legislation. However, I appreciate
receiving your views and will certainly have them in mind whenever such
a measure comes before us on the House floor for consideration and a
vote.

Dear Mrs. Peschka:

It was so thoughtful of you to write to thank me
for co«sponsoring H.R. 66, a bill to end the.use of the
steel—jaw, leghold trap and other painful trapping devices.

This legislation is now pending in the Fisheries
and Wildlife Subcommittee of the House Merchant Marine and
Fisheries Committee. You may be interested to know that
the Subcommittee has recently concluded hearings on the
anti—trap legislation.

Because your address is in the 23rd Congressional
District, which is represented by the Honorable Peter A.
Peyser, I am forwarding your letter to him so that he
too, may be advised of your views. - '

This is being done as a matter of Congressional
courtesy and custom, which is followed by all Members of
Congress.

this important legislation. -

Dear Mr. Mays:

Thank you for your letter urging my vigorous action
to promote hearings and passage of H.R. 66; promote
the maintenance and prohibit the weakening of the Marine
Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act;
end the unnecessary drowning of dolphins; and secure
passage of H. J. Res. 448.

As you may know, H. R. 66, a bill to discourage the
use of painful devices in the trapping of animals, has
been referred to my Subcommittee on Fisheries, wildlife
Conservation and Environment. We expect to begin hearings
on November 18. I can assure you that I shall do everything
possible to secure prompt and thorough Subcommittee review
of this bill.

Both the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered
Species Act have done a great deal to preserve animals
threatened by extinction. In view of the pressing need to
protect these animals, I can assure you that I would not
sanction any effort to weaken these Acts and, in fact, am
anxious to see that the Marine Mammal Protection Act is
strengthened so as to prevent the unnecessary slaughter of
our dolphins. The Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife
Conservation and Environment is presently conducting over-
sight hearings on the Marine Mammal Protection Act and we
are in the process of marking up legislation on the En-
dangered Species Act.

H. J. Res. 448, which would protect the great whales
by imposing an embargo on the fishing products of nations
engaged in commercial whaling, is also awaiting considera-
tion by my Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife Conservation
and Environment. I share your concern about the threatened
extinction of these fine mammals, and am hopeful that
consideration of H. J. Res. 448 can be expedited.

Dear Marion:

We did it! And it wouldn't have been possible without
your help. I can't thank you enough for all the work done
by the League in my election to the Senate.

Not only did the League provide massive campaign support,
but your staff showed a sophistication I have rarely seen
in a citizen group. You run an outstanding organization.

As you know, I was especially worried about the first
district. Your door—to-door canvass, your election day turnout
work, and your excellent tabloid all made a big difference.

The Democrats carried Washington County for the first time
in over 20 years. And your efforts helped us beat Roger Jepsen
in his own backyard of Scott County too.

The radio ad on taxic waste which you did for me using
Robert Redford as narrator was very effective. Apparently
Roger Jepsen became so concerned that people were hearing
the truth about his dismal environmental record that in the
last days of the campaign he mailed thousands of pieces
describing what a "born again" conservationist he is. That
didn't work for him either.

Thanks too for the thousands of dollars LCV gave to the
campaign and the additional money you raised from individuals.

I look forward to working with you and your colleagues
during my next six years in the Senate. As you know, I will
continue to make health and environmental issues a top priority.'

Dear MrSQMKink:

This has reference to your recent cards giving me the benefit of
your views on H.R. 2350, particularly the provisions of
Congressman Walgren which are included in this measure that is
expected to reach the House floor for consideration in the near
future.

I have also noted your support of H.R. 1797 that would end the
use of steel jaw leghold traps on animals.

I have always felt that we have a responsibility to treat animals
in a humane manner, and I will definitely keep your views in mind
when these bills come up for a vote in the House.

Your support of H.R. 1373 that would prohibit the owners and
operators of Federally assisted rental housing for the elderly or
handicapped from restricting the ownership of pets by the tenants
of such housing will also receive my consideration should this
legislation reach the full House for action.

With kind regards.

Dear Ms. Herrington:

As a Member of CongreSS who has been an active supporter of
wildlife and animal welfare legislation for the past 18 years, I was
greatly disturbed over your recent letter to some of my constituents
describing my cosponsorship of H.R. 6928 as "irresponsible."

I understand that your organization is supporting H.R. 556,
a much stronger bill which was introduced by Representative Robert
Roe. But do you realize that I am also a cosponsor of your legislation?
In addition, you should know that 33 other Members (including Repre-
sentative Roe) whom you called "irresponsible" also support your bill.

I am sure that I can speak for these Members by saying we
would all like to see tougher legislation approved. However, we sim-
ply must face the political realities of this situation. In the cur—
rent Congress and with the present Administration, it is highly unlikely
that such a tough bill would be enacted. Should we then allow animal
abuse to continue until we have.enough support to pass a tough bill?

Or, should we pass legislation, which admittedly does not go far enough,
but at least will be a beginning first step in the right direction.

Unfortunately, this bill (H.R. 6928) faces strong enough op-
position from various research groups and passage this session is unlikely.
I regret that you have chosen to join them in blocking passage of this bill.

Thank you very much for taking the time to contact me and express your strong
opposition to the continued funding of NASA' 5 Life Sciences Animal Research
Program. I appreciate having your input on this matter .

I took specific note of the arguments outlined stressing the need to reorder the
priorities of NASA regarding animal experimentation through budgetary adjustments.
I certainly understand and share your deep concern for the humane treatment of
laboratory animals and animals in general.

As you may know, the President has presented his Fiscal Year 1984 budget to the
Congress for consideration. I am currently in the process of reviewing his program
and will pay close attention to funding and authorizations for NASA programs ,
including those dealing with life sciences. I will most certainly keep your concern
for animals involved in such experimentation in mind throughout my deliberations.

Again, thank you for contacting me . I welcome your input and look forward to
hearing from you in the future regarding this or any subject of mutual concern.

With best wishes ,

Sincerely,

Dear Colleague:

We all represent large numbers of people who care deeply about animals. Many
have felt for years that there were insufficient safeguards to insure that
laboratory animal pain and suffering would be kept to a minimum. To meet this
legitimate concern, the House Science and Technology Committee this week re-
ported H.R. 6928 (previously H.R. 6245), the "Humane Care and Development of
Substitutes for Animals in Research Act." We would like to invite you to

join with many of us in cosponsoring this legislation. We feel it provides a
balanced and credible framework to assure the public that animal life will be
respected in the laboratory, and also toginsure that biomedical research will
continue to develop as rapidly as possible.

The legislation reported was the product of Committee hearings and other'
efforts over several years, including a continuing discussion of evolving

drafts with leaders of both the animal welfare and scientific communities.
Though several bills on this subject had been introduced in recent years,

none had been able to achieve even Subcommittee approval in previous Congresses.
However, the extended dialogue in this Congress has now produced a bill that has
won a considerable degree of acceptance from major scientific and animal welfare
groups, including the American Physiological Society and the Humane Society of
the United States. It was reported by the full Science and Technology Committee
by a near unanimous and completely bipartisan vote.

An outline of the legislation is on the reverse side of this sheet. The Com-
mittee will also be glad to provide a fact sheet and report language on re-
quest. Our staff contacts are Carol Rodgers or Tom Moss, Majority, and Don
Rheem, Minority, at 225-8844. Call or leave word concerning your interest in
cosponsorship. - -

The advancement of scientific research is an important value for us. We also
feel, however, that public trust, respect, and understanding of that research
is crucial for its advancement. This legislation will provide an effective
framework to increase consideration for the treatment of animals in research,
and thus strengthen public trust. It is in the best interest of those who
care most for animals, and it is in the best interest of those committed to
the rapid progress of science.

Sincerely,

Short Summary of Main 1 ‘,__5_ ;.
Provisions of H.R. 6928 ““559“

Humane Care and Development of Substitutes for Animals in Research Act

8-l2-82

Title I authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make awards
to sponsor research into, and development of, methods of research and testing
that l) do not require live animals, 2) reduce the number of animals used, or
produce less pain and distress in animals used, and to establish the validity
of proposed methods.

The Secretary is asked to designate an Advisory Panel, either as a new body or
as part of an existing committee or panel, to provide advice concerning his
responsibilities under this title. The panel is to work out effective systems
to insure that any proposal meeting the requirements of this title will re-
ceive full consideration for funding by all appropriate programs of HHS, or from
resources made available under this title. ’

Section 2 of this title provides for promotion by the Secretary, through coor-
dination with appropriate regulatory groups and agencies, of improved testing
methods. The Secretary will direct the National Toxicology Program to signifi~
cantly increase its resources for R80 on new methodologies and validation of non-
animal research and testing methods. A report is to be made in two years on prog-
ress under this section.

Title II provides that, in order to receive Federal funding for research involv-
ing the use of large numbers of animals, a research entity must be accredited by

a private agency or agencies designated by the Secretary of Health and Human
Services. The standards for accreditation shall be at least comparable to the best
of current practices as stated in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.

Full accreditation may be achieved over a period of IO years as far as needed
structural changes and modernization of facilities are concerned, and a research
entity may be provisionally accredited if it demonstrates satisfactory progress
toward the 10 year goal. However, during the interim period the entity muSt meet
standards for animal care and treatment of the existing Animal Welfare Act, and
must comply with appropriate requirements for feeding, watering, shelter, exercise,
etc., and acceptable procedures of anesthesia set forth in this Act.

The research entity must maintain an animal studies committee which is to include
a veterinarian and a member not affiliated with the research entity. Among other
duties, the committee will make semiannual inspections of all animal facilities,
and will review ongoing research to assure that animals are treated and used with
appropriate care and handling. Thegcommittee will certify to the responsible
Federal agency that inspections have taken place, and report any violations of
assurances required in the bill. The reports are to be signed by a

majority of the committee, with minority views attached if desired.

Title III sets out certain assurances and justifications that peer reviewers must
look for in research proposals involving the direct use of conscious animals.
These include appropriate provision for involvement of a veterinarian; proper use
of anesthetics and analgesics, or justification for withholding them when scien-
tifically necessary; provision for appropriate pre- and post-surgical medical.and
nursing care; and assurance that, except for reason of scientific necessity, no
animal will be used in more than one major operative procedure from which it is
allowed to recover.

Title IV clarifies that the bill is not intended to cover research for improved
food production, or-for conservation of wild animal species.

Title V provides that review and reenactment of the bill will be required
in ID years for it to remain in force.

Dear Mrs. Epstein:

Thank you for your recent communication regarding H.R. 3823,
the Humane Transportation of Horses Intended for Slaughter Act of
1981. I very much appreciate knowing your views on this important
issue.

I share your concerns about the mistreatment of horses and
ponies being shipped to slaughter. However, to be completely
frank with you, the chances of this bill being enacted are very
slim at the present time.

My reasons for saying this have nothing to do with the merits
of the bill but rather the current political climate in Washington.
The present Administration is engaged in a massive effort to restrict
the sc0pe and cost of the federal government in nearly all programs
that are not defense related. This bill mandates new government
spending and more government regulation for what appears to be a
worthy purpose, but which is clearly contrary to the goals of the
current Administration. Needless to say, I do not agree with this
"meat—axe" approach to government which has weakened or destroyed
many worthwhile government programs and has prohibited even the
consideration of any new non-defense related program, regardless of
its merits. Therefore, I would encourage you to work to strengthen
state laws regulating animal welfare rather than to hope for action
from the federal goVernment.

Again, thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. I
regret that I could not have had better news for you regarding this
important matter.

Sincerely,

Tom Harkin

Dear Mr. Graham:

Thank you for your letter concerning reauthorization of the
Endangered Species Act.

The House Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife is in the
process of completing hearings on this matter and draft legislation
should be reviewed in the near future. The Endangered Species Act
is our nation's most effective law for protecting wildlife which might
otherwise become extinct. Although some changes may be needed to
make the legislation more workable, I would oppose any effort to
weaken the scope of this law. You can be assured that I will keep
your thoughts in mind during subcommittee consideration.

Again, thank you for your concern and for your letter. If I
can ever be of assistance to you, please feel free to get back in

Dear Adele:

I want to thank you for getting in touch to advise me of your
support for efforts to protect the environment, as well as your
concern over various positions taken by Interior Secretary Watt.
I appreciate knowing of your interest in this regard.

Basically, my views are similar to those expressed by numerous
conservation organizations and private citizens opposing Mr. Watt's
policies. Judging from the Secretary's record, it appears that his
positions -- such as noted in your correspondence -- reverse the
progress we have made in establishing our national pro-environmental
policies. I believe that we must retain these policies and defeat
measures to turn back the efforts we have made in this area.

You can be assured that I shall be active in efforts to maintain
our environmental conservation policy.

Sincerely,

issue of concern.

I share your concern about this question. Unfortunateiy, it does not appear
that I wil] have the opportunity to vote on this resolution. It has been bottied
up in the House Committee on Agricuiture, of which neither I nor Congressman Mottl’,
are a member. Opponents of this 1egisiation have been abie to manipuiate the cur-
rent anti—reguiatory atmosphere to argue that this wouid just be another federai
intrusion into private business, in this case, the farm. However, if this biii
should reach the floor of the House, you can be assured that I wi11 keep your views
in mind in deciding how to vote.

cern to you.

Eva Rugg
Route 5, Box 37A
Ft. Myers, Florida 33908

Dear Eva:

Thank you for your letter concerning funding for the B-1 Bomber
and the ME missile.

I understand your concern over funding strategic programs such as
the 8—? Bomber and the MK missile. For over a decade, both the
United States and the Soviet Union have had the capability to de—
stroy each other. Why under these conditions do we continue to
pour money into weapons of destruction? This is a very reason—
able guestion to ask. Unfortunately, more funds are needed to
counter threats to peace.

Because missile technology was crude in the 19605 and 19708, nu~

clear weapons were safe from surprise attack. However, technolo—
gical advances have changed this. Missiles are more accurate
now, making our land—based missiles and bombers vulnerable. By
using a portion of their weapons to destroy most of ours, the
United States could lose its place as a world leader in a sur—
prise attack.

The reason for building the B-1 Bomber and MX missile is to elimi—
nate this instability by making sure that the Soviets know that —
even if they launched a surprise nuclear attack on the United
States — enough American forces will remain to destroy the
U.S.S.R. In this way peace will be preserved; the alternative is
unacceptable.

Thank you for expressing your interest and concern over this vi—
tally important subject.

Sincerely,

Paula Hawkins
United States Senator

Dear Mrs. McATeenan:

Thank you for your response to my Ietter on the subcommittee's
efforts to deveiop an effective piece of animai weIfare Iegisiation.
Since you have taken the time to write me again on this issue I thought
I would give you another update on our activities.

The subcommittee has neariy compieted its work on a new biII. We
are writing our own biII because we know the biIIs introduced so far
have IittIe chance of succeeding in the House or Senate. It is my

opinion that a ”committee” biII is our onIy chance of success in this
Congress. That is why I have been working with Chairman Doug Maigren on

new IegisIation.

Moreover, the subcommittee is rewriting the biTI to narrow its
scope in order to keep it within our echusive jurisdiction. If we
report out a bi11 that affects the jurisdiction of other congressionai
committees, they can request referraI and then “sit” on the biII ~-
effectiver kiTIing it. If we can keep the biI] in our hands, we can
report it directIy to the House roor where the members wiIT have to
vote on it. Otherwise, there is IittIe chance any Iegisiation wiII pass
the 97th Congress.

Thank you again for your continued concern. I hope we can count on

your support for our biII once it is finaiized.

to assure this country's continued commitment to protect our

As you are probably aware, a so-called compromise Clean Air
Act revision has been introduced and there has been a great deal
of pressure to get on the band wagon. Even so, there is still
considerable objection to the compromise. Hearings are
continuing on this issue, and I certainly want to reserve
judgment until I see what bill emerges from the committee.

Thank you for your letter telling me of your support for the
International Endangered Species Treaty (CITIES), particularly regarding the
protection of the American Bobcat.

I share your belief that it is important that we protect our wild animals
from the danger of extinction through abuse or commercial exploitation. While
no amendment has yet been offered to exclude the American Bobcat from
protection under the Endangered Species Act, substantial justification would
be necessary to garner support for such a proposal.

I can assure you that I will give my close attention any amendment which
is offered in this regard and I will keep you views in mind as I do so.

Again, thank you for telling me of your views on this issue, and please

and inhumane treatment of animals. I support actions undertaken to
insure the development of more humane techniques of animal management.

H.J. Res. 305 is legislation which would establish a Farm
Husbandry committee. The purpose of the committee would be to carry
out a thorough investigation and to prepare a comprehensive report
concerning all aspects of intensive farm animal husbandry in the United
States. This bill is pending in the Committee on Agriculture.

You may also be interest in learning that I am a cosponsor of the
Research Modernization Act, a measure which would encourage the devel—
opment of alternative methods for testing chemicals rather than using
live animals for testing purposes. The legislation has been referred
to the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Science and Technology
Committee for consideration. Hearings were held last October by the
Science and Technology Subcommittee on Science Research and Technology.

I appreciate both your interest and concern. Please be assured
that I will keep your comments in mind as Congress continues to look
further into this subject.

With kind personal regards.

Dear Mrs. Webb:

Thank you for your recent communication regarding H.R. 3823,
the Humane Transportation of Horses Intended for Slaughter Act of
1981. I very much appreciate knowing your views on this important
issue.

I share your concerns about the mistreatment of horses and
ponies being shipped to slaughter. However, to be completely
frank with you, the chances of this bill being enacted are very
slim at the present time.

My reasons for saying this have nothing to do with the merits
of the bill, but rather the current political climate in Washing—
ton. The present Administration is engaged in a massive effort to
restrict the scope and cost of the Federal Government in nearly
all programs that are not defense related. This bill mandates new
government spending and more government regulation for what appears
to be a worthy purpose, but which is clearly contrary to the goals
of the current Administration. Needless to say, I do not agree
with this "meat-axe" approach to government which has weakened or
destroyed many worthwhile government programs and has prohibited
even the consideration of any new non-defense related program,
regardless of its merits. Therefore, I would encourage you to work
to strengthen State laws regulating animal welfare rather than to
hope for action from the Federal Government.

Again, thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. I
regret that I could not have had better news for you regarding this
important matter.

Sincerely,

TomgHarkin
Chairman ./

Thank you for your letter concerning the Marine Mammal Protection
Act amendments.

As you may know, the House Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife
Conservation and the Environment held hearings on amendments to the Marine
Mammal Protection Act in mid-July. The Subcommittee reported the amendments
on July 21. The full Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee will be con—

The Marine Mammal Act amendments, H. R. 4084, propose several
changes to the Act designed to improve the administration of the Act and
the management of marine mammals. Several changes to the Act dealing with
state management and incidental taking provisions are addressed in the
amendments. In addition, the amendments include several provisions designed
to improve the reporting procedures for incidents involving the harm or
harassment of marine mammals.

I appreciate hearing from you on this matter. Please be assured
that I will keep your concerns in mind as the Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee considers these matters.

Dear Mrs. Feldman:

Thank you for your letter of May 23rd regarding the Research
Modernization Act (HR 556). '

It is truly unfortunate that helpless animals must be subject
to the testing methods found in our nation‘s laboratories. Humane
methods or non—animal alternatives must be found to minimize the
suffering of these creatures. Congress has responded by proposing
several bills including the Research Modernization Act to develop
new methods of testing, researching and experimentation that would
minimize the use and painful suffering of live animals.

These bills are awaiting action before the Committee on Energy
and the Committee on Science and Technology. While I do not serve
on either of these two committees, you can be sure that I will have
your thoughtful comments in mind should_these bills come before the
full House for a vote.

Once_again, thank you for calling your views on HR 556 to my
attention. Please do not hesitate to contact me on issues or legis—
lation of concern to you in the future.

Sincer ly,

Dear Miss Ferman:

 
  
 
 

 
 

In the Tast few weeks, I have received your Tetters on the use of
steeT jaw Teghon traps, the Wde Horse Act and on the hunting of seaTs
on the PribiTof IsIands in ATaska. PTease accept my apoTogies for the
deIay in getting back to you.

      
   
 
 

Humane methods must be found to minimize the suffering of baby harp
seaIs sought after for their peTts. This issue is highTy controversiaI
and has spurred much bitter debate. For at Ieast two decades, animaT
Tovers have protested the hunt as unnecessarin crueT. In recent years,
Canada has responded to harsh criticisms by attempting to make the
program more humane and by assuring the hunt wiTT not endanger the species.

     
    
 
    
   
 
 
 

 
 

The U.S. Congress has repeatedTy expressed concern over inhumane
cIubbing methods and aTso over the possibTe extinction of the harp seaTs
caused by the hunt. You can be assured that the Congress wiTT continue
to watch cToser deveTopments in the Canadian_government's baby seaT
poIicy.

 
   
    
  
 
 
 
    
    
 
 

SecondIy, humane methods must be found to minimize the suffering of
the wde creatures that are sought after for their peTts. The use of
steeT jaw Teghon traps intensifies the brutaTity of the fur harvest. The
cTosing force of the traps often causes immediate injury, which is com-
pounded as the animaT struggTes to escape. The trapper may not return
for days, during which time the animaT may die from starvation, exposure-
or predation. The animaT may even chew off its own paw in an effort to
escape.

AIthough fur—bearing animaTs are the primary targets of these traps,
”non—target“ animaTs may aTso faTT victim. There are documented cases of
endangered species, househon pets and even chderen being injured.

 

NearTy a dozen countries, incTuding Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Great
Britain forbid the use of the steeT jaw Teghon traps. A few states aTso
Iimit the use of these traps. ATthough the reguTation of a11 hunting and

      




Margaret Feldman
May 12, 1981
Page 2

trapping practices is primarily a matter of state jurisdiction you may be
assured that I will be carefully looking into the possibility of federally—
imposed restrictions to make the fur trapping industry more humane.

Also, in your letter of March 1, you voiced your support of HR 4631.
I fully agree that the use of live animals as visual lures in dog racing
and training is something that ought to be stopped. "Coursing” strikes
me as a throwback to the time when inhumane treatment of animals was
generally accepted. -

In my past correspondence with you I encouraged your continued
efforts to keep me informed of your views on wildlife and issues
affecting our animals. Once again, thank you for doing just that.
Your comments are always welcome and appreciated, and I hope you will
continue to share them with me.

Dear Ms. Ascatigno:

Thank you for your comments regarding the reauthorization of
the Marine Mammal Protection Act. As you know, the Administration
had hoped to hold the bill to a one year reauthorization reported
by the Commerce Committee at our May 6 executive session, With the
proviso that we make an effort to work out any amendments that may
truly be necessary this summer.

I want to assure you that I intend to work to maintain the
integrity of the Marine Mammal Protection Act and will continue to
consult with representatives of the conservation community through-
out the negotiation process, as we have from the beginning. How-
ever, this agreement is preferable, in my view, to taking the bill

up again next year and having to deal with the prospect of exten—
Sive amendments from an Administration that may not be particularly
senSitive to the objectives served by this landmark legislation.

Thank you again for advising me of your views on the act. As
efforts to develop sound amendments proceed this summer, I Will be
watching carefully to see that the act's integrity is preserved.

Thank you for your letter of August 24, expressing your
concerns about several matters.

I have noted your support for H. R. 638, the Lacey Act
Amendments. This bill is pending before the House Agriculture
Committee, the House Commerce Committee and the House Science
and Technology Committee. Although no action has been taken
as yet on this bill, I will remember your support during

my consideration of the Lacey Act Amendments.

Be assured that I will keep in mind your support for H. R.
4035, which calls for a one million dollar increase in funds
for the enforcement of wildlife laws by the U. S. Fish and
Wildlife Service.

Please know that I share your concern about cruel treatment

of animals, and I will bear in mind your support for H. Con.
Res. 27, which encourages federal agencies to develop alternate
methods for the painful Draize eye irritancy test. I have
also noted your support for H. R. 374, which is pending before
the House Commerce Committee, and seeks to restrict the use

of steel jaw leghold traps.

sidering the matter in the near future.

The Marine Mammal Act amendments, H. R. 4084, propose several
changes to the Act designed to improve the administration of the Act and
the management of marine mammals. Several changes to the Act dealing with
state management and incidental taking provisions are addressed in the
amendments. In addition, the amendments include several provisions designed
to improve the reporting procedures for incidents involving the harm or
harassment of marine mammals.

I appreciate hearing from you on this matter. Please be assured
that I will keep your concerns in mind as the Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee considers these matters.

With kind personal regards.

Dear Mr. Santora:

Thank you for getting in touch with my office concerning
reauthorization legislation for the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

As you may know, the Merchant Marine and Fisheries' Sub~
committee on Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation and the Environ~
ment held hearings on H. R. 2948, Marine Mammal Protection Act Re~
authorizations, in early April. During the hearings, several organi—
zations testified in favor of threemyear authorizations while the
Administration and others favored a one-year reauthorization Opening
up the possibility of amending the act next year. Full Committee
mark—up of the reauthorization bill is expected in the near future.

I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue.
Please be assured that I will keep your views in mind as the Merchant
Marine and Fisheries Committee considers this and related matters.

With kind personal regards.

Sincerely,

Dear Margaret:

Thanks so much for writing to inform me of your concerns about
the Draize method of testing the eye irritancy of substances .

It is truly unfortunate that rabbits must be subjected to this type
of testing method. Congressman Jacobs, along with other Members of
Congress , has responded by proposing several bills to develop alterna—
tive methods of testing , researching, and experimentation that would
minimize the use of and painful suffering to live animals.

These bills are pending action before the Committee on Energy
and the Committee on Science and Technology. While I do not serve on
either of these two committees , be assured that I will have your thought—
ful comments in mind should these bills come before the full House for a
vote .

I am glad to see that citizens like you are concerned enough about
the welfare of animals to take the time to voice your objections to
these tests . I share your concern about the need to develop alternative
testing procedures . I would like to encourage your continued effort to
keep me informed on this and similar issues. Far too often, economic
and social issues upstage problems such as this one .

Again, I thank you for taking the time to inform me of your con-

cerns .

MARYLAND

October

 

 

Dear NRA Member:

For all of us who believe in the right. to keep and bear
arms, 1980 can be the year of the political grand slam.
We can elect a prowgun/'prt.r-~htmting president. We can
elect a prongun/proi-hunting majority in the US. House
of Representatives and the US Senate!

What, we each do ~— and what our families, friends and
neighbors do individually -~— on Nover‘nber 4 is the key.
We must vote ~-- we must, in the electoral process m- express
our singular belief in the right to keep and bear arms.

A grand slam is possible this year. But equally possible, if
we do not exercise the rigl'tt to vote, is an erosion of past
political gains.

in our efforts to make our votes count, 1980 surely is
the most. critical year f irearrns owners have ever faced.

For the past: several trionths, the entire staff of NRA-
l LA has been working with key NRA members to prepare
political preference charts for each state -—-~ covering the
most important races. in this work, we have compiled a
rating chart to assist pro—firearms rights voters in
making a wise choice.

You will note that we have reviewed and graded candi—
dates only on issues of importance to the NRA’S purpose.
Tier:- National Rifle Association takes no position on
issues not directly related to the right to keep and bear
arms and the right to hunt.

We tried to confine our choice to candidates with a
realistic chance. to win. ’l‘here are many minor—party or
independent candidates who support our stand, but we
advise voting for candidates who can indeed win. Other
wise, fringe candidates can drain away just enough votes
in a tight race to hand tin. :...iection to an anti~gunner. .

Our rating system gives a “report card” grade of A, B,
C, D, or F. The grade is the composite remit of many
months spent by the lnstitutc’s staff garlming data on
candidates’ voting records and legislative proposals, and
reviewing their public statements, press releases, and
campaign speeches .... even letters to constituents. In
addition, the candidates’ responses to a detailed ques—
tionnaire were tabulated and evaluated.

Finally, in some cases the grade includes vul‘rjective

judgement of the 1LA staff, which observes lawmakers at

close hand on a daily basis. In that judgement, we have
weighed additional key factors such as leadership,
dedication and effectiveness, and the willingness to go
beyond just voting.
Here’s what the scores mean:
A ——-— Solidly pro—gun, pro-sportsman, opposed to
any more controls on firearms or legislation
restricting hunting.

B ~— Basically on our side, but might vote for some
form of additional restrictions.
C -—- would probably vote in favor of more restric—

tive controls such as registration and licensing
but not in favor of banning the private posses-
sion of handguns.

D ——-— Would definitely vote for restrictive controls on
firearms and/or hunting issues.
F —-— Favors most restrictive prohibitive legislation

or would vote for banning the private posses—
sion of firearms and/or hunting.

? ~— Did not respond to any of our mailings m often

I an indication of opposition to private gun
ownership.
letter -— Sent a letter response which indicated a suppor-
tive position, but refused to answer the ques-
tionnaire.

Through this rating sheet, we have provided you, the
pro—firearms voter, with the kind of information
necessary to make the commitment in your polling place.
Please share this information With your friends and
families so that they can join in this effort. And vote. Get
them to vote. It’s never been more important.

Dear Friends:

Many thanks for your correspondence regarding the use of animals in medical
research. Unfortunately, because time does not permit a personal response to
the numerous inquiries on this subject, I must reply with a form letter.

The Committee on Science and Technology has actively monitored legislation
similar to that about which you are concerned. As a Committee member and one of
the original cosponsers of the Research Modernization Act, I feel H.R. 4805
represents a concerted effort to ameliorate the inhumane practices resulting
from the use of live animals in scientific research. For example, H.R. 4805
will establish a Center for Alternate Research which will concentrate on the
development of scientific methods minimizing the use of live animals. Addi-
tionally, I have cosponsored H.R.282, the Humane Methods of Research Act, which,
like H.R. 4805, addresses and attempts to rectify the inhumane practices arising
from the use of animals in scientific research. A

While the use of animals has been an integral part of scientific research
and may be necessary in specific research projects, we must guard against un-
necessary inhumane practices. Though much remains to be accomplished, please be
assured that my actions have and will continue to work towards positive efforts
in minimizing the occurence of inhumane research techniques on animals.

Again, many thanks for sharing your views. If I can be of any further
assistance, please feel free to get in touch.

Dear Mrs. Booth:

Thank you for writing to urge my support for H. R. 4631,
a bill to prohibit the use of live lures, principally rabbits, to
train greyhounds and other racing dogs. This bill also would outlaw
the sport of coursing.

I share your concern over the need to bring an end to un—
necessary cruelty being inflicted on helpless animals. Our country
has a policy of preventing needless cruelty to animals where possible.
Such a policy should apply to the training of racing dogs and the sport
of coursing.

The House Agriculture Committee, which exercises jurisdiction
over animal welfare legislation, has not yet scheduled action on H. R.
4631. Should the Committee consider the bill and send it to the House
Floor for action, you can be assured that I will keep your support for
the measure in mind.

I appreciate hearing from you on this important legislation.

With kind personal regards.

Williém .

Dear Mrs. Dushkind:

Thank you for your letter concerning reauthorization of the
Endangered Species Act.

The House Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife is in the
process of completing hearings on this matter and draft legislation
should be reviewed in the near future. The Endangered Species Act
is our nation's most effective law for protecting wildlife which might
otherwise become extinct. Although some changes may be needed to
make the legislation more workable, i would oppose any effort to
weaken the scope of this law. You can be assured that I will keep
your thoughts in mind during subcommittee consideration.

Again, thank you for your concern and for your letter. If I
can ever be of assistance to you, please feel free to get back in
touch with me.

Warm regards.

Sincerely,

éu/

Earl Hutto

Dear Mrs. Aldridge:

Thank you for your very kind words about my vote on H.R.
39, the Alaska Lands Bill, and for your additional comments on
attempts to severely weaken the Endangered Species Act when it
comes before the House for re—authorization.

The controversy over the Endangered Species Act came to
the forefront due to the Tellico Dam —— snail darter dispute.
Congressman Robin Beard threatened to offer 682 amendments to
an appropriations bill to delete funding for the protection of
each species on the endangered list. As a compromise with Repre—
sentative Beard, the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee
agreed to conduct oversight hearings on the Endangered Species Act,
and they have done so.

As you know, however, the Endangered Species Act is scheduled
to come before the House in the near future for a three year re—
authorization, and Representative Beard as well as others are again
threatening to offer weakening amendments. I personally feel that
the Endangered Species Act is an important instrument in protecting
imperiled wildlife, and I will certainly have your comments well in
mind when this matter comes before the full House for consideration.

Again, I appreciate your very kind comments and hope you will
continue to keep in touch on such issues of interest.

as your Representative of the 10th Congressional District of
Massachusetts.

I sincerely appreciate knowing your views on this matter

and share your concern regarding the harvesting of seals on the

Presently, a member of my staff is researching and review-
ing alternatives for preventing the harvesting of seals on the
Pribilofs. The findings of this research will help me in de—
termining whether legislative initiative is warranted.

You would be interested to know that the House Committee
on Merchant Marine and Fisheries is planning hearings, on the
harvesting of seals on the Prihilofs, in the future. You may
be assured that I will have your thoughts in mind in the course
of my deliberations of this vital matter.

Knowing the opinions of my constituents is extremely

helpful to me in the performance of my legislative duties. May
I encourage you to continue to keep me advised on issues of

special interest to you.

(P.L. 9?—9053. P.L. 93-205 prohibits construction of a federal
project that would harm an endangered species of plant, animal

ation or May 15th. S. 2899 passed the Senate by a QM to 3 vote

As amended, S. 2899 would establish a seven member federal
heard that could vote to exempt projects from the protection of
the Endangered Species Act if the board members decided the
benefits of the project outweighed the value of the threatened
species.

Again thank you for your letter, and you may he assured

this legislation reach the House floor For consideration. May
I encourage you to continue to keep me advised of your thoughts

~.

Dear Miss Foster:

Thank you for your recent correspondence regarding
Senator Birch Bayh's amendment to the Agriculture
Appropriations bill to increase funding for animal welfare.

Senator Bayh's amendment which was approved by the Senate
provided $808,000 for enforcement of provisions of the Animal
Welfare Act. Specifically, $200,000 would go for the
enforcement of the anti-dog and cockfighting provision and
$608,000 would go to the regulation of the air transport of
animals.

Because of the differences in the amounts in the House
and Senate versions of the bill, a conference committee must
meet to reconcile the variations. I understand, however, that
there are not likely to be any drastic cuts in the funds.

I hope this information will be useful to you. Please
let me know if I can be of.further assistance.

Sincerely,

A BILL

To provide for loans for the establishment and/or construction

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa—

That Congress ﬁnds and declares as follows: that because
of an over-abundance of pets, there is an enormous homeless
dog and cat population; that this over-abundance results in a
serious nuisance to the public, a grave health hazard to
communities, and needless suffering to the homeless animals;
that there is a shortage of clinics and trained personnel to
provide the spaying and neutering necessary to rid us of the
over—abundance ; that humanitarian groups are unable to cope

Dear Miss Schulz:

1 re..111 with interest your letter in opposition to R 6970,
legislationw which would a1low increased Lcilling of dolphins an}
porpoises by tuna fisherman. Ne are in agreement on this matter.

Recently, I went on record as opposing H.R. 6970. In my opinion,
this legislation would severely damage the original intent of the
Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1912. It is essential that the
number of porpoise deaths be kept at a minimum.

On June 1, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 6970. This
bill we s amended so that there would be a successive reduction in
the number of porpoise killed each year. The quota would be set
by the Secretary of Commerce. It now awaits Senate
consideration.

I appreciate your talzing the time to write. If I may ever be of
service with a particular federal matter, please do not hesitate
to call on me. 1 ' -

Congressman Tom Harkin

Conventional wisdom and a poll shgmngcmmlgpoints behind said that Tom Harkin couldn’t
win against Bill Scherle, an ultraconservative Iowa Congressman. NCEC’s Joe Rothstein designed
a communications plan for Harkin to get massive early visibility with paid TV in mid-September
and numerous free media methods of questioning whether Scherle’s record represented the
people. Bob Squier took over and produced TV spots built around “work days” where Tom would
spend a full day as a foundry worker, farmer or one of the many other occupations in his district.

NCEC urged the campaign to build everything around the “work day” theme— including a
“housewife workday" in a family of 5 kids which dominated the media for the last several days of
the campaign. NCEC time-buyer Jan Ziska used limited funds to strategically target the impact of
paid air time.

The Harkin team did everything else right—even a crossword puzzle as a handout—and got
51% of the vote, one of the year’s biggest upsets.

Congressman Bob Traxler

in March of 1974, with three weeks to go in the last of five special Congressional elections,
Bob Traxler had no media and little money to buy air time. President Nixon made the personal
decision to go into Michigan's 8th District with all guns blazing. NCEC‘s team of Bob Squier,
Joe Rothstein and David Brunell, flew into Saginaw in a two-engine North Central prop plane and
put down next to Air Force One and Two. They developed the theme “A Michigan voice in
Washington, not another Washington voice in Michigan,” focused everything around income
tax day (the day before the election) using the phrase “Our chance to put our mouth where our
money is . . produced a five-minute film, three TV spots, six radio spots, designed and took a
strategic poll with Peter Hart's help, arranged for time buying, and created last minute newspaper
ads to counter the GOP’s Agnew-like charges against Traxler-all for less than $5,000 in
NCEC’s services.

Traxler won with 51% of the vote.

Congresswoman Gladys Spellman

Gladys Spellman, a county commissioner with a twenty year record of outstanding public
service, decided to run for Maryland’s Fifth Congressional District. Incumbent Rep. Larry Hogan
entered the gubernatorial race and chose a successor who shared his staunch conservative
leaning.

An early poll had shown Spellman with a substantial lead, but a Washington Post
poll a few months before the election indicated that although Spellman was perceived as a
viable candidate, her campaign organization was not reaching the uncommitted voters.

To meet this problem, NCEC sent consultants Bob Beckel and Mike McClister to manage
and reorganize the campaign staff. A new poll taken and analyzed within 36 hours confirmed an
increasing number of uncommitted voters. To reach these voters and to utilize the poll’s finding
that Spellman was perceived as an able and experienced public official, Beckel and McClister
revised the campaign strategy to emphasize her record of public service. A detailed brochure
was developed, and NCEC sent Bob Squier to produce radio spots with citizens who had
been helped by Spellman in the past.

Finally, NCEC consultants organized a massive “get-out-the-vote” effort, and despite a
vicious slander campaign against her in the closing weeks, Spellman won by 4,000 votes.

Animal Welfare Measure

Can Still Be

., I 1,
/BY AN overwhelming vote the House
has approved a much~needed measure
to require humane treatment of ani-
mals during their trans ortation in
interstate commerce an to prohibit
dog and cock fights and interstate
promotion of these. events.

The bill would amend the Animal
Welfare Act of 1966 which was enacted
to prevent the “dognapping” of pet
dogs and cats and their subsequent.
resale for use in research, and to
promote humane treatment of dogs,
cats and certain other laboratory an-
imals by dealers.

The measure also carries anamend:

ment by Rep. Margaret MifiHecklerf,
requzrmg that federal agencies ..,u.smg~’

ial‘ioraiory animals must submit proof
are in compliance with the hu-
mane standards of the Animal ii elf are
Act.

The Senate has passed a similar bill
which focused on the transportation
problems of animals and did not include
many of the provisions of the House bill.
However, the Senate bill brought all
retail pet stores under the regulations
of the Animal Welfare Act and added
birds, horses and cold-blooded animals

to the transportation provisions, which

the House bill did not do.

But the Senate bill does not bar
animal fighting, a ractice that is bru-
tal and growing. ogfight promoters
are so well organized that they have
magazines with national circulation,
breeding and training farms that raise
dogshespecially trained to fight to the
deat .

“Two trained dogs would often con
tinue for over an hour,” said Rep.
Jospeh G. Minish (D.-N.J.) “and won d
literally chew out each others’eyes and
break or chew off each others’ feet and

Improved

legs...all to the cheers and goading of
handlers and onlookers...”

’Most state laws governing animal
fighting are not strongly enforced and
even so, these laws were passed, for the
most part, long years awe and require
fines as low as $25 andD seldom more
than $100.

The House version would make it a
federal crime knowingly to sponsor,
participate in, transport in interstate
commerce or use the mails to promote
fights between birds, dogs or other
mammals, except man. Violators could
receive fines up to $5,000 and a prison
term up to one year.

Other provisions of the House bill,
would centralize the regulation of car-
riers and intermediate handlers. such
as express companies; and freight for-
warders. .ii animais in interstate com~
merce under the jurisdiction oi the
Secretary of Agriculture.

The Secretary would have authority
to set. rules and regulations for contain-
ers, feed, water, rest, ventilation and
temperature affecting animals shipped
for commercial reasons.

The House bill would also prohibit the
shipment of very young animals w
under eight weeks old .... to prevent
puppies and kittens from being
snatched from mothers before they are
properly weaned.

The conference committee of the
Senate and House can come up with the
best legislation if it. combines the best
features'of both Sei'iati'.> and ilousc itiills.
The final version should include- the ban
on animal fighting. Ailii if. shouid in-~
Clude the provision bring‘i‘uig ail retail
pet stores under the Animal iiisitaro
Act. It should also add colrlblooded
animals, birds and horses to the trans
portation provisions, which the House
version didn’t do.

July 23, 1976

Mrs. Mabel L. Phinney
31 N. Highland Road
Norton, Massachusetts 02766

Dear Mrs. Phinney:

Thank you for your letter expressing your concern over the porpoises
which are being killed inadvertently in the' 'on porpoise method of tuna fishing.

As you may know, this complex problem has arisen in the last decade with
a new method of fishing for tuna involving the use of a "Purse Seine Net" which
entraps many of the porpoises which lead the fishermen to the schools of tuna.
Solutions to this problem have been sought through both the legislative and the
judicial processes as far back as 1972 when the Congress passed the Marine Mammal
Protection Act. This act provided for a moratorium on the killing of marine mammals,
but granted an extension for the tuna fishermen to continue purse seine fishing by
permit from the Marine Fisheries Service of the Department of Commerce.

Implementation of the act was challenged, and on May 11, 1976 a U.S. District

Court banned all incidental porpoise killings as of May 31, 1976. This ban has been
blocked indefinitely until all appeals of the case have been heard, probably by the
end of the summer.

Congressman Leggett's bill, which would maintain the status quo until
December 31, 1976 and thereafter give the Department of Commerce the authority to
set quotas and establish regulations regarding the killing and injuring of the
porpoises, was introduced into and approved by the Subcommittee on Fisheries and
Wildlife Conservation and the Environment on May 26, 1976. The bill is now pending
before the full Marchant Marine and Fisheries Committee and a recent check of that
committee shows no action scheduled at this time.

I intend to follow this legislation carefully as it proceeds through the
Congressional process. My purpose will continue to be to find a reasonable com-
promise which w1ll protect our margelousmmarine mammals without crippling the tuna

iﬁﬁustry.r And as I review the proposals which come beforememINWTIIWReep foréﬁS§er*
in‘my mind the concerns you have raised.

With best wishes, I am

the opportunity to “get away from it all”-—-
has become of crucial importance; and
Whereas there are few pursuits providing
a better chance for healthy exercise, peaceful
solitude, and appreciation of the great out-
doors than hunting and ﬁshing; and
Whereas this is evident in the fact that
more than ﬁfteen million hunting licenses
and twenty-four million ﬁshing licenses were
issued in 1970; and
Whereas this income provides a rich source
of funds for ﬁsh and wildlife conservation
and management and for the salvation, pres-
ervation, and propogation of vanishing spe-
cies; and
Whereas hunters and anglers traditionally
have led in the effort to preserve our national
resources; and
Whereas outdoor sportsmen also have led
in the promotion of proper respect for private
_ as well as public property, of courtesy in the
ﬁeld and forest, and in boating and ﬁrearm
safety programs; and

Whereas there is no present national rec-
ognition of the many and worthwhile con-
tributions of the American hunter and an-
gler: Now, therefore, be it ,

Resolved by the Senate and. House of Rep—
resentatives of the United States of America
in Congress assembled, That the President of
the United States declare the fourth Sat-
urday of September 1975 as “National Hunt-
ing and Fishing Day” to provide that de-
served national recognition, to recognize the
esthetic, health, and recreational virtues of
hunting and ﬁshing, to dramatize the con-
tinued need for gun and boat safety, and
to rededicate ourselves to the conservation
and respectful use of our wildlife and natural
resources.

lation. It simply recognizes the contri—
bution of those who love the outdoors
and who have aided so signiﬁcantly in
conservation programs and in? the im-
provement of outdoor recreation in this
country. A similar resolution passed the
Senate May 8.

This is the fourth year in which many
of our colleagues have joined in support-
ing a resolution asking the President to
declare the fourth Saturday of Septem-
ber National Hunting and Fishing Day.
This year the number is 235, the largest '
ever.

National Hunting and Fishing Day
has become one of the most meaningful
and widely observed activities of its
kind. In the last 3 years, there have been
over 8,500 separate observances in all
50 States with some 40 million Americans
taking part. These activities are annu-
ally endorsed and recognized by all 50 -
State governments and by over 500
municipalities.

The observance of National Hunting
and Fishing Day has served to make mil-
lions of Americans more aware of the
outdoorsman’s role in conservation and
has enlisted the support of all Ameri—
cans, sportsmen and nonsportsmen
alike, in the ever important conservation
effort. '

Mr. ROUSSELOT. Mr. Speaker, will
the gentleman yield?

Mr. SIKES. I am happy to yield to the
distinguished gentleman from California
(Mr. ROUSSELOT).

(Mr. .ROUSSELOT asked and , was
given permission to revise and eXtend his
remarks.)

Mr. ROUSSELOT. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.

I wish to compliment my colleague, the
gentleman from Florida '(Mr. SIKES) , for,
ﬁrst of all, abiding by the general rules
and suggestions of the subcommittee in
making sure that there were at least 219
Members who desired to have this day set
aside. Also I wish to point out that the
resolution really has national support by
State legislatures and communities
throughout the country. Mr. SIKES was
willing to comply with the wish of the
committee to make sure that there was a
substantive support for this particular
commerative day across the country. I
want to compliment him for his effort to
make sure that this was known to the
committee before it acted. ’

Mr. SIKES. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate
the gentleman’s ﬁne comments, and I am
most appreciative of the effective support
given this resolution by the distinguished
gentleman from California (Mr. Rous-
SELor).

It is a day that is Widely recognized.
This is the fourth annual observance,
and it is one that has been endorsed by
the State governments of all 50 States.

Mr. FOUNTAIN. Mr. Speaker, will the
gentleman yield?

Mr. SIKES. Yes, I yield to the distin-

.. guished gentleman from North Carolina.

(Mr. FOUNTAIN asked and Was given
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) .-

Mr. FOUNTAIN. Mr. Speaker, I would
like to associate myself with the com-
ments of the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. Spares) and to commend him and

have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to in-
Clude extraneous matter on the vote to
override the President’s veto just con
sidered. ‘

The SPEAKER. Is there objection to
the request of the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania? _

There was no obj ectio-n.

 

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER

The SPEAKER. Pursuant to the pro-
visions of clause 3(b) of rule 27, the
Chair announces that he will postpone
further proceedings today on each mo-
tion to suspend the rules on which a
recorded vote or the yeas and nays are
ordered, or on which the vote is ob-
jected to under clause 4 of ‘rule 15.

After all motions to suspend the rules
have been entertained and debated and
after those motions, to be determined by
nonrecord votes have been disposed.
of, the Chair will then put the question
on each motion on which the further
proceedings were postponed.

 

WAR RISK INSURANCE

Mrs. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, I move
to suspend the rules and pass the bill
(HR. 1073), to extend the provisions
of title XII of the Merchant Marine Act,
1936, relating to war risk insurance, for
an additional 5 years, ending Septem-
‘ber 7, 1980, as amended. ,

The Clerk read as follows:

' H.R. 1073

Be it enacted by the Senate and House
of Representatives of the United States’
of America in Congress assembled, That
section 1214: of title XII of the Merchant
Marine Act, 1936 (46 U.S.C. 1294-), is
amended by striking out “September 7, 1975”
and inserting in lieu thereof “September 7,
1978”.

The SPEAKER. Is a second de-
'manded?

Mr. MCCLOSKEY. Mr. Speaker, I de-
mand a second. ' ~

The SPEAKER. Without objection, a
second will be considered as ordered.

There was no objection.

The'. SPEAKER. The gentlewoman
from Missouri (Mrs. SULLIVAN) is recog-
nized for 20 minutes, and the gentle-
man from California (Mr. MCCLOSKEY)
. will be recognized for 20 minutes.

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Missouri (Mrs. SULLIVAN).

Mrs. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.

(Mrs. SULLIVAN asked and was given
permission to revise and extend her
remarks.)

_ Mrs. SULLIVAN .‘ Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of HR. 1073 and urge the
immediate passage of this legislation.

The purpose of this legislation is to ex-
tend the provisions of title XII of the
.Merchant Marine/Act, 1936, relating to
war risk insurance for an additional 3
years, ending September 7, 1978: This
title expired on September 7, 1975.

The Government war risk insurance
provided for in title XII would be neces-
sary to maintain the ﬂow of US. water—
borne commerce in the event of a major
war. This type of insurance was provided

, b

CONGRESSIONAL ' RECORD — HO:

by the Government in both World Wars I
and II and proved effective in protecting
the civilian and military commerce of the
United States with total premium re—
ceipts in excess of losses paid. Title XII
of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, was
enacted at the outbreak of the Korean
war in 1950 as. temporary legislation and
has been extended at several intervals
since that time.

This program costs the Government
nothing and is implemented by the Mari-
time Administration in the Department
of Commerce through the issuance, for a
fee, of binders under which Government
war risk insurance will attach immedi-
ately upon termination of the commercial
policies. The war risk insurance revolving
fund has current total assets of approxi—
mately $6 million.

This bill was unanimously reported
from both the Merchant Marine Subcom-
mittee and the full Committee on Mer-
chant Marine and Fisheries, and was
strongly supported by both the Depart-
ment of Commerce and the Department
of Defense.

As you know, it has not been necessary
for the Government to use all of the au-
thority it has had under title XII for the
past 25 years, but in View of the recent
expiration of this program, and the
necessity of providing Government war
risk insurance in the event it is needed,
I believe this legislation should be passed
immediately. _

Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like.
to yield to the chairman of the Merchant
Marine Subcommittee, the gentleman
from Virginia, for a more detailed expla‘
nation of the bill. '

Mr. DOWNING of Virginia. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for
yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I join the distinguished
chairman of the Committee on Merchant
Marine and Fisheries in urging the im- ‘
mediate passage of HR. 107 3.

The bill would amend title XII of the
Merchant Marine Act, 1936, to extend for
3 years, to September 7, 1978, the Gov-
ernment war risk insurance program
originally enacted in 1950. The program
expired by its terms on September 7, 1975.

Title XII of the Merchant Marine Act, *
1936, authorizes the Secretary of Com—
merce, with the approval of the Presi-
dent”, to provide war risk and certain ma-
rine and liability insurance for the pro-
tection of vessels, cargoes, crew life, and
personal effects when commercial insur-
ance cannot be obtained on reasonable
terms and conditions.

Titl-e‘XII of the Merchant Marine Act,
193 6, was enacted at the outbreak of the
Korean war in 1950 as temporary legisla-
tion and has been' extended at regular
intervals since then.

This program is implemented by the
Maritime Administration in the Depart-
ment of Commerce through the issuance,

for a fee, of binders under which Gov-

ernment war risk insurance will attach
immediately upon termination of com-
mercial war risk insurance. These bind-
ers give back-to-back coverage with com-
mercial policies and expire at the end of
30 days. At that time, premiums for the
insured period would be ﬁxed retroac-
tively. '

others for the fact that we are giving
this kind of recognition without declar-
ing another national holiday, which
would cost the taxpayers some money.
and this does not.

Mr. SIKES. This does not declare a
national holiday. People do this on their
own, but with their own effort and
money. The gentleman 'from North
Carolina has been a very helpful ad«
vocate for the program.

Mr. FOUNTAIN. Mr. Speaker, there
was a time when both hunting and ﬁsh-

ing were not Sport in our country, but.

vital means of keeping food on the ta-
bles of pioneer America. We are all well
aware of that fact, especially during the
Bicentennial year as we refresh our rec-
ollections of the events of American
history.

Of course, such is not the case today.
Both hunting and ﬁshing are now pri—
marily recreational pursuits for most of
our people—two of our most healthy and
rewarding pursuits, I might add.

Having been born and raised in rural
eastern“ North Carolina, I am keenly
aware of the importance and signiﬁcance
of both hunting and ﬁshing—two sports
especially enjoyed and easily accessible
to all in the Second Congressional Dis-
trict of North Carolina, which I have the
honor to'represent. ,

Consequently, I' am particularly
pleased to rise in support of House Joint
Resolution 209, which would establish
the fourth Saturday of each September
as National Hunting and Fishing Day.

It is entirely ﬁtting and proper for the
Congress to oﬁicially set aside this day
to honor those who participate in two
sports of such importance from the time
of the ﬁrst English settlement in the
New World on the shores of North Caro-

; lina—Sir Walter Raleigh’s Lost Colony.

Again, I would like to emphasize that
this bill would not establish another le—
gal holiday but would simply pay well-
deserved tribute to America’s hunters
and ﬁshermen. This is no Monday holi-
day bill. As a result there would be no
cost in terms of lost productivity and no
expense for the hardpressed taxpayers
to bear.

Additionally, may I emphasize, Mr.
Speaker, that hunting and ﬁshing pro-
Vide an excellent opportunity for recre-
ation, and for the enjoyment of the
countryside in every season of the year.
This is particularly true in my home
State of North Carolina, where a large
number of citizens ﬁnd real pleasure
in hunting and ﬁshing from the moun-
tains of western Carolina, to the rolling
Piedmont, to the coastal plains, to the
sandy shores of the Atlantic.

Incidentally, the licensing of these ac-
tivities renders signiﬁcant revenue to
my State, and to other States. This reve-
nue is, generally, used for wildlife con-
servation pro-grams.

Outdoorsmen in North Carolina and
elsewhere have constantly been in the
vanguard of the effort to support appro-
priate wildlife conservation measures
and the preservation of the open space
so needed in our increasingly crowded
country, ,

To reiterate, this resolution will offer
some recognition to the hunters and ﬁsh-

CONGRESSIONAL ' RECORD ——- HOUSE

erm-en who have long been responsible
citizens, prudently using the natural re-
sources of our countryside and helping
to maintain the proper balance of nature
in rural America.

Mr. Speaker, this resolution is a
worthwhile recognition of the beauty
that is ours in rural America, and of the
men and women who enjoy that envi-
ronment in a responsible way.

I support this resolution and urgemy _

Colleagues to do so as well.

Mr. WHALEN. 11-1111. Speaker, will the
gentleman yield ?

Mr. SIKES. Yes, I yield to the gentle-
man from Ohio-

(Mr. WHALEN asked and was given
permission to revise and- extend his
remarks.) «

Mr. WHALEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to
commend the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. SIKES) for his initiative.

As an author of a similar resolution, I
Certainly support the one that is before
this body this afternoon. Therefore, I

. urge my colleagues to vote in support of

House Joint Resolution 209.

Mr. SIKES. The gentleman has given
very effective support to our program.
I appreciate his interest.

Mr. WHALEN. Mr. Speaker, I am
pleased to rise in supportiof House Joint
Resolution 209, which asks the Presi-
dent to declare the fourth Saturday of
each September “National Hunting and
Fishing Day.”

As the cospons or of an identical reso-

‘lution, I think it is most appropriate

that a day be. set aside to recognize the
recreational virtues of hunting and ﬁsh-
ing, to emphasize the continuing need
for gun and boat safety, and to rededi-
cate ourselves to the conservation and
proper use of our wildlife and natural
resources. In addition, National Hunting
and Fishing Day is a tribute to the con-
tributions of responsible hunters and
ﬁshermen who have worked to conserve
our environment and protect the nat-
ural habitats so vital to American wild-
life. Indeed, their efforts have served as
a catalyst to stimulate the interests of
other citizens in environmental matters.

I want. to commend today the hunters
and ﬁshermen in the Third District of
Ohio who have placed emphasis upon
safety and upon instructing cur young
citizens in the proper enjoyment and
use of the outdoors. Their attitude and
interest deserve both admiration and
emulation.

It is my hope that the observance of
National Hunting 'and Fishing Day will
renew public concern about conserva-
tion and environmental preservation
and instill in our children a respect for
nature. In view of the enthusiastic re-
sponse to this occasion in previous years,
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of
this resolution. .

Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Mr. Speaker, will
the gentleman yield?

Mr. SIKES. Yes, I will be happy to
yield to the gentleman from California.

(Mr. LAGOMARSINO asked and was
given permission to revise and extend his
remarks.)

Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Mr. Speaker, I
want to associate myself with the re-
marks of the gentleman in the well and

bers of the House, to endorse, support,
and vote for this resolution. '

I think it truly does commemorate

something that is very signiﬁcant in our

country, and I want to join the gentle- ,

man in the well in his efforts.

Mr. SIKES Mr. Speaker, I thank my “

colleague, the gentleman from Califor-
nia (Mr. LAGOMARSINO) for hiscomments.
Mr. GILMAN. Mr. Speaker, will the

gentleman yield? ,
Mr. SIKES. Yes, I yield to the gentle-'

Mr. GILMAN Mr. Speaker, 1 thank the L .

gentleman for yielding. ,
I, too, want to join my colleagues in

supporting this resolution and in. com-

mending the gentleman from Florida

(Mr. Sums) for the introductionof this 1-

worthy resolution emphasizing the need
for gun and boat safety and for the
promotion of conservation with respect
to wildlife.

With so many millions of people 7'

throughout this country who enjoy the 7
outdoor recreation of hunting and ﬁsh- '

ing, the observance of a National Hunt-

ing and Fishing .Day is certainly a com—. *9

mendable way of bringing recognition to“ 1 .
those wholesome activities and in stress-mg

conse1vation programs.

It seems to me that the Congress should

With all the more important problems 3

that the Nation is faci11g.__,___1nf1ati on, :

tion—I hate to see the Congress wasting '-
its time on legislation so petty and-“u- .1
insigniﬁcant. ~

 




 

H 8502 ~

One of the whereas clauses in this
joint resolution boldly states: “Whereas
in the congestion and the complexities,
the tensions, and frustrations of today’s
life, the need for outdoor recreation the
opportunity to ‘get away from it all’——
has become of Crucial importance.’
Another “Whereas” talks about “healthy
exercise and peaceful solitude.”

These goals and objectives, of course,
Mr. Speaker, are concepts that everybody
understands and supports. But I cannot
“for the life of me understand‘how the
passage, of a resolution like this is going
"to enhance any of the things the authors
- have indicated that it will do.

_ Mr. CHARLES H. WILSON of Califor-
nia. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman
yield?

Mr. HECHLER of West Virginia. I

. _ yield to the gentleman fiom Califomia.

(Mr. CHARLES H. WILSON of Cali—
fornia asked and was given permission to
"revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. CHARLES H. WILSON of Califor-
nia. Mr. speaker, I want to thank the
gentleman from West Virginia for yield-
ing to me. I am disappointed that I must
ﬁnd myself in disagreement with my
good friend, the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. SIKES) who is a sponsm of this
" legislation and who is an outstanding
legislator.
.. But as one who has su uncon-
trol and who will con1 support“
gun control, I feel that this type of a
resolution is not appiopi iate
sonally. I emmery much in the
on this and if there is a vote
"I probably will be one of the veiy few

po1ted

whowill vote against the 1esolution and

yet I think it is signiﬁcant that I must
oppose it because of the issues involved.
. I think that is the important thing in-

volved not whethe1 we agree or disagree
with commemorative days.

Mr. HECHLER of West Virginia. Mr.
Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentle-
man from California (Mr. CHARLES H.
' WILSON). I would really like to observe
that this resolution has absolutely noth-
- .iing'to do with gun control. Whether you
, favor or oppose this resolution does not
gin any way equate with whether one is
for. or against gun control. That issue is
irrelevant, 'it seems to me, insofa1 as
support for the passage of this 1esolution
is concerned.

COming from the State of West V11-
,ginia where almost eveiybody is eithe1
a hunter or a ﬁsherman, I dare say that
there are more hunting and ﬁshing li-
censes per capita in the State of West
Virginia than in any other State in the
, Union.‘ Therefore, it would seem that a
Congressman from West Virginia should
be supporting this resolution. I Cannot
see that this resolution will help hunters
and ﬁshermen in any possible way. I
Would like to direct one question to my
very good friend, the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. SIKES), the sponsor of this
resolution. I note that the resolution is
designating the fourth-Saturday of Sep-
tember 1975,.as‘ National Hunting and
Fishing Day does so to provide for dra-

- matizing- the continued need-for gun and
.. boat safety. I Would ask the distinguished

—- gentleman—from Florida if it is, not nec—
.. essai'y‘tqhave gun and boat safety 365

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —— HOUSE

days of the year. Does this mean all the
other days are not going to be devoted
toward dramatizing the continued need
for gun and boat safety?

Mr. SIKES. Mr. Speaker, if the distin-
guished gentleman from West Virginia
will yield, of course we must have gun
and boat safety each day, certainly we
need gun safety and we need boat safety,
and we will always ha’veto address our-
selves to both every day, but that is a
side issue. Gun safety and boat safety
as my friend the gentleman from Cali-
fornia pointed out has nothing whatso-
ever to do with gun control legislation.
But, just as we observe other days just
as this only once in a year, while we are
doing it we feel that we might well em-
phasize things like gun safe”r y and boat
safety.

Mr. HECHLER of West Virginia. Mr.
Speaker, I thank my good friend, the

gentleman from Florida, for his observa-
tions but I dare say there will not be a
single additional hunter or ﬁsherman
that will simply go out and get away
from the tensions and frustrations of
today’s life as a result of Congiess enact—
ing a silly resolution like this.

I think the gentleman from California
is an appropriate Member to ask that
question.

dozens of organizations which sponsored
this and the National Riﬂe Assggiation

Mr. HECHLER of West Virginia. Mr.

Speaker, continuing, it has been pointed.

out that many State legislatures sup-
ported resolutions similar to this. I think
all of us know the facts of life. It' is very
easy for a State legislature and rep-
resentatives thereof to say yes to a
resolution like this in order to get rid
of the pressure of special interest groups.
Likewise, the same thing is true of Mem-
bers of Cong1ess.Igo no ot obse1ve any

Mr. HECHLER of West Virginia. I
yield to the gentleman from Maryland.

Mr. BAUMAN. I thank the gentleman
for yielding, as a result of his very
tolerant attitude, to one who disagrees
with his position.

I was proud to be a cosponsor with the
gentleman from Florida of this resolu-
tion originally. I certainly support it to-
day, but I think it particularly appro-
priate for those of us who do support the
sports of hunting and ﬁshing to have
the resolution up now as an answer to

Speaker, will the

September 9, 1975

one Of the most distorted journalistic
[television efforts I have ever seen. I refer
to the CBS television show last Sunday
evening-“TheGuns of Autumn.” Rarely
have I seerimavfrevwoﬁerdist’ort the issues
so, as they did at CBS. The show was a
deliberate attempt to discredit hunting
and hunters. There was such a response
that CBS has scheduled an hour later
this month to allow answers. Many of
the sponsors withdraw their sponsorship,
as they should have. ‘

If nothing else, I think that our pass—
ing this resolution will show that there is
a place in our national life f01 hunting
and ﬁshing, that it can be done in a
humane ”way, that it has a p1 opei func-
111111, and that these are great Ameiican
sports. Hopefully, we will ﬁnd a netwmk
to depict these sports as they really
occur.

Mr. HECHLER of West Virginia. I
thank the gentleman from Maryland. I
just observe that I do not see how the
passage of this resolution in any way
whatsoever is going to change anybody’s
opinion on anyk, television program, or
represent the intent of Congress on the
CBS piogiam in any way. I would u1 go,
a negative vote on this resolution
WM? Speaker I’i‘lﬁpe "that” this 1eSolu-
tion is defeated, and that we rese1 ve these

memorations like Veterans Day, Fourth

M1 TAYLOR of Missouri. Mr. Speaker,
I rise in support of House Joint Resolu-
tion 209 designating the fourth Satur-
day of each September as “National
Hunting and Fishing Day.” "

Probably more Americans ﬁnd refuge
from the pressures of everday life in the
1elaxation that can Only be found in ﬁeld
01 on a beautiful lake 01 stieam while
hunting or ﬁshing.

The designation of this date as “N a— .
tional Hunting and Fishing Day” is an
ideal time for attention to be called to
our constitutional right to bear arms that
is a traditional part of our American
pioneer heritage, and to emphasize the '
proper and safe use of ﬁrearms.

It has been said that the hours spent
ﬁshing aie deducted from man’s allotted
y eais on Ea1 th.

Mi. Speaker, I am feitunate to 1epie-
sent one of the most popula1 hunting
and ﬁshing areas in this Nation. The
beautiful clear lakes and streams. in
southwest Missouri are unsurpassed in
their beauty and abundance of game ﬁsh
such as bass, trout, crappie, and catfish.

Our Ozarks are blessed with virtually
every kind of game for "the pursuit of the
hunter. Whether you prefer the sound
of the running hound in pursuit of the .
elusiVe fox, coyote, or racoon, the ma-
neuvering beagle as he chases the cotton:-
tail or the unsurpassed pleasure of quail
shooting behind a well—trained bird dog
or would rather engage in still hunting
for deer, you will ﬁnd it all in the beauti- _
ful Ozark Mountains of southwest Mis-
souri. ‘“

Probably most important, the visiting
hunter and ﬁsherman will ﬁnd in our

modatmns that are available from the

M ‘.Speaker, I think it is appropriate
that in these times of stiess and concern
th: t this Congress pass this resolution
d esignatin‘g the fourth Saturday of each
1 September as “National Hunting and
Fishing day.”

Mr. JOHNSON of California. 'Mr.
Speaker, there are few pursuits providing
a better chance for healthy exercise,
peaceful solitude and appreciation of the
great outdoors than hunting and he hing
In the busy life led by many Americans
today, there is a great temptation to “get
away from it all.”

More and more people living in our
metropolitan areas are leaving the Cities
on the weekends and for vacations and
are going to the great open spaces re—
maining in our land. Many are backpack—
ing in our national parks and national
forests as they seek to return to nature,
even if only temporarily. Others turn to
private lands. Still others seek different
forms of recreation and relaxation.

Representing a congressional district
which contains some of the ﬁnest out—
door recreation areas in the Nation, I can
fully understand the appeal of hunting
and ﬁshing. Through designation of a
“National Hunting and Fishing Day,”
Americans will be encouraged to partici-
pate in these relaxing, rewarding, and
challenging activities.

Hunters and anglers traditionally have
led the effort to preserve our natural re-
sources, and it is appropriate that the
many and worthwhile contributions of
the American hunter and angler be rec—
ognized through celebration of a “Na-
tional Hunting and Fishing Day.”

This special day has been commemo-
rated for the past years. Last year,
more than 40 million people participated
in the Observances sponsored and en-a
dorsed by over 40 national and local con-
servation organizations. All 50 States and
over 500 municipalities have joined in
observing "I“National} Hunting and Fishing
Dag/a, !’

Over 50 milligram Ariencans actively
hunt and'Tish each W
alone, last year 15 million huntlng li-

cense s were issued and 25 million ﬁshing

licenses were issued to residents of the
Golden State. These individuals not only
enjoyed the pleasures of the outdoors,
but also participated in State and na-
tional conservation programs through
the purchases of their licenses.

I strongly believe that this is a very
beneﬁcial tradition which can be signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced by continued celebration
of “National Hunting and Fishing Day.”
I encourage my colleagues to join in
passing this legislation which is similar
‘ to legislation already approved by the
‘ other body.

Mr. CONTE. Mr. Speaker, it is with
extreme pleasure that I rise in support
of this joint resolution to request the
President to proclaim the fourth Satur-

day of each September as “National
Hunting and Fishing Day.” The bill does
recognize the fact that more than 42
million Americans have joined the ranks
of either hunter or angler, but most im—
portant of ali———this bill recognizes the
American sportsmans’ role as conserva-
tionist.

Mme than $2in million is generated

play an integral role in the operation, of
the various State ﬁsh and wildlife
services.

Many of our aacietissfor., the protec-
tion of various endangered animals have
large numbers of sportsmen” in their
ranks. Because of the need to preserve
and protect the mating areas of ducks in
Canada, “Ducks Unlimited” was formed

by a number of sportsmen and conserva- ,

tionists alike. who were concerned about
the preservation of this Nation’s numer-
ous fiocl {s of migratory ducks and geese.
Through the efforts of Ducks Unlimited
the US. Migratory Bird Commission’s
wetland acquisition program, our flocks
are again beginning to ﬂourish.

This joint resolution is also intended
to recognize the ode: ts of all Americans
to conserve and respect our wildlife and
natural resources. It is clear that many
of those to be commended for their wild-n
life conservation eﬁ'orts are part of this
great body.

Just this past summer, in the Depart-
ment of the Interior appropriations bill,
this Chamber passed the Dingell amen-d-
ment to increase the wetlands acquisition
program by $10 million. As a member of
the ltiigratory Bird Commission I was
extremely pleased to en sport that amend-
ment. Further, the House renewed its
commitment to the Atlantic salmon res-
toration program which I was only too
pleased to testify on before the appropri-
ations Subcommittee on the Interior,
chaired by my god friend the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. YATES).

We have come a long way in our ﬁsh
and wildlife conservation efforts. For in-
stance, through the efforts of conserva-
tionists and sportsmen alike, there are
more than three times as many white
dove— tailed deer in the United States

*1 vv- w

than there were when Columbus landed

tinue'. our support of the wetlands ac—
quisition program should continue to
merit the, enthusiastic support it does to-
day. Our Atlantic salmon restoration
program must continue to proceed
through its various phases until comple-
tion. I would like to remind my good
friends, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
YATES), and the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. MCDADE) , that they as-
sured this body on the House ﬂoor during
consideration of the Interior appropria—
tions bill that they would accede to any
reasonable increase by the Senate in the
funding for the salmon ﬁsh hatchery in
Bethel, Vt.

Finally, I should like to commend the
author of this joint resolution for his
continued efforts in ﬁsh and wildlife con—
servation. It is so appropriate that one
of the most important pieces of conser-
vation legislation—the Sikes Act—bears
his name. I was only too pleased to co-

H 8503

sponsor this joint resolution and join his
effort to proclaim September 27 as “Na-
tional Hunting and Fishing Day.”

I urge my colleagues to support its pas-
sage. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Mr. ROLAND. Mr. Speaker, I support
House Joint Resolution 209, which would
authorize a “National Hunting and Fish-
ing Day” on the fourth Saturday in Sep-
tember. Hunting and ﬁshing have long
been a tiaditio an in western Massachu-
setts. Before that they were a means of
survival. I know I speak. for the many
sportsmen’s groups in my district in urg-
ing the House to declare September 27 as
“National Hunting and Fishing Day.”

Hunting and ﬁshing provide means to
get out in the open, to exercise and to
reacquaint ourselves with the land. The
recreational value of these activities is
undisputed.

A national hunting and fi hing day will
also recognize the contributions t 1at the
over 412 million Americans who partici-
pate in these activities have made in the
ﬁelds of conservation. recreationa
safety, and preservation of endangered
species. Mr. Speaker, September 27 will
not only recognize the recreational bene-
ﬁts of these activities but their many
other beneﬁts as well.

Mr . SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, I
have no further requests for time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The ques-
tion is on he motion offered by the gen“
tlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. Sermon—

ER) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the Senate joint resolution (2.7 1
Res. 34.)

The question was taken; and on a di-
vision demanded by Mr. HECHLER of ”Vi/”est
Virginia, there were—ayes 39, noes 7.

So (two—thirds having voted in favor
thereof), the rules were suspended, and
the Senate joint resolution was passed.

A motion to reconsider was laid on the
table.

A similar House joint resolution (HJ.

ought to start with any little thing, as
the British have done and some other
units of government have done, by ac-
knowledging certain churches, by ac-
knowledging them through government
action for favorable conditions. For that
reason, I oppose the bill.

Mr. GILMAN. Mr. Speaker, will the
gentleman yield?

Mr. McKAY. I yield to the gentleman ..

from New York.

Mr. GILMAN. Mr. Speaker, Senate
Joint Resolution 125, which is iden-
tical to House Joint Resolution 597
authorizes and requests the President to
issue a proclamation designating Sun—
day, September 14, 1975, as “National
St. Elizabeth Seton Day.”

It is recognized that Elizabeth Seton,
through her own life and work, made an
extraordinary contribution to the reli~
gious and moral life of our country, as
well as to the education, health, and wel-
fare of vast‘numbers of our citizens.

She will become the ﬁrst American-
born person to be canonized and pro-
claimed to be a saint on September 14,
1975, at ofﬁcial ceremonies in St. Peter’s
Basilica in Rome.

Having cosponsored this resolution, I
fully support the merits of this resolu-
tion.

However, I do question the Census
and Population Subcommittee’s pro—
cedures and want to point out to the
Members that there is some question as
to whether this resolution comes within
the criteria as set forth in the sub-
committee’s policy for consideration of
commemorative legislative, as adopted
by the House Pest Ofﬁce and Civil Serv~
ice Committee on April 17, 1975.

The committee’s policy on introducing
commemorative resolutions states:

Only proposals concerning individuals,
groups, and events with national appeal and
signiﬁcance which shall be demonstrated by

their potential to receive serious considera-'

tion as a national holiday and by written
endorsement by a majority of the Members
of the House, shall be considered.

To illustrate the confusion and disap—-

pointment which arises when this policy
is not adhered to, let me cite a personal
example. On March 12, I introduced
House Joint Resolution 309, to au~
thorize and request the President- to pro-
claim April 6, 1975, as a day of ob-
servance of the 30th anniversary of the
liberation of the survivors of the holo-
caust.

The Subcommittee on Census and
Population informed me that since my
resolution did not meet the aforesaid.
criteria for a national holiday, it could
not be considered.

Mr. Speaker, my point, simply stated,
is that our Subcommittee on Census and
Population should either strictly adhere
to the reform policies it has established,
or it should abandon them, permitting
any and all commemorative resolutions
to be considered by the full committee.

Despite this procedural criticism, I
urge my colleagues to support the
worthy resolution before» the House
which recognizes the signiﬁcant con-
tributions which Elizabeth Seton has
made to the religious, moral, and educa-
tional life of many Americans.

Mr. McKAY. I agree with the gentle»
man on the fact of procedures, but I dis--
agree on the contribution. I think we
can ﬁnd religious leaders all over the
country who have contributed to the re
ligious life and morality of this country.
If we want to extend it that way, we can
have one of these resolutions up every
week for that honored purpose.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from West Virginia.

Mr. HECHLER of West Virginia. lirl'r.
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from
Colorado (Ms. SCHROEDER).

Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker. 1.
would like to comment in response to the
gentleman from New York, who is. a
member of this committee. That is ﬁrst
of all, that the policy is not just that
of the subcommittee. It was adopted by
the full committee and that on. this
measure admittedly it was taken up in
the subcommittee and the full committee
before 218 cosponsors were gathered.
However, at this point it has 230-plus
cosponsors. The agreement was we would
not bring it to the ﬂoor until we had met
that criteria.

As we know, the policy said we would
take it up at certain times of the year.
Because of the recess in August, it was
difﬁcult to collect the names.

So it does meet the criteria of having
the needed number of endorsements be
fore it came to the floor.

On the issue of a national holiday,
that is a subjective judgment on which
reasonable Members, I think, can differ.

I think the gentleman from Utah
makes a very strong point, because there
should be separation of church and state,
but there are other people who say no,
when 218 Members have recommended
passage and they have made that subm
jective judgment, then I do not think we
should object. I think any criteria being
subjective is much more difﬁcult to make
than having an objective one of having
219 Members endorse it.

Mr. HECHLER of West Virginia, Mr.
Speaker, I would like to observe in re—
action to what the gentlewoman just
said, we do not paSs legislation in this
body by the number of COSponsors of leg»
islation, whether it is 230 or 250 or see.

. The ultimate test comes by a vote here

on the ﬂoor. Ofﬁcial support cannot be
tested by the number of cosponsors.

I certainly commend the gentleman
from Utah for the position which the
gentleman has taken.

Mr. Speaker, I would be glad to yield
to the gentlewoman from New Jersey.

Mrs. FENWICK. Mr. Speaker, I‘tharzir
the gentleman from West Virginia for
yielding.

I think all of us would hesitate to do
anything that contravenes the Constitu-
tion of the United States, but I scarcely
think that commemorating and canoniz~
ing a saint, the ﬁrst in the history of our
Nation, has much to do with the law that
says Congress should make no lav: re~
specting the establishment of religion. We
are not here establishing any religior:-
We are here honoring a person whose
life was given to works of mercy and
charity and faith and education. I thin;L
it is entirely ﬁtting that we should do so

Dear Mr. and Hrs. wright:

Thank you for your communication in which you express your support for
an extension of the Animal welfare Act Of 1970.

There is legislation pending before the House Agriculture Committee which

seeks to revise and extend the Animal welfare Act of 1970 and the Federal

Laboratory Animal welfare Act of 1966. The bills would set standards

for the transportation, handling and care of certain animals in interstate
and foreign commerce; in general, they seek to insure the.humane treatment
of all animals. I

I have been informed that the Agriculture Committee hopes to begin hearings
on animal welfare sometime during September or October. You may be sure
that I share in your concern over the well—being of animals and that I
shall have your views in mind whenever related legislation comes before

us on the House floor for consideration and a vote.

Again, thank you for writing to me. I trust that you will feel free to
contact me on any other matters of mutual interest and concern.

Sincerely,

Dear Mrs. Wright:

Thank you for your letter of January 28 and the copy of your
letter to Secretary Rogers Morton in which you urge against

the weakening of Executive Order 11643, "to keep from poisoning
animals on public lands."

I assume you may be referring to the proposal of the Environ—
‘mental Protection Agency to authorize experimental use of
sodium cyanide for coyote control. A c0py of the prOposal

is enclosed for your information. You will note (page 2)
that the permits will be issued only for non—Federal lands,
in light of a 1972 Presidential Order (E.O.ll€h3) which pro-
hibits the use of all chemical toxicants on Federally owned
lands.

 

Therefore, this proposal would not have the effect of weak—
ening Executive Order 116h3.

If my assumption is incorrect, I would appreciate further
clarifying information on the specific matter you have in
mind and I will then be happy to look further into it for
you.

Sincerely,

AJH/tz

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 9, 1974

 

EPA TO AUTHORIZE EXPERIMENTAL USE OF SODIUM CYANIDE FOR COYOTE .
CONTROL

Russell E. Train, Administrator of the Environmental Pro-

 

tection Agency, today announced that EPA is prepared to permit'
experimental use of the pesticide sodium cyanide in a coyote
control device known as the M-44.

Since March 1972, an EPA order has banned the use of sodium
cyanide and several other pesticides for use against mammalian
predators, such as the coyote. The ban aims at protecting non-
target animals from accidental poisoning. ' ’

The M-44, which has shown some evidence of being specific
to coyotes versus non-target species, is a spring loaded yngﬂ
placed in the ground which launches a capsule of sodium cyanide.
The cyanide ejects when a coyote pulls on a piece of scented
material on top of the tube. Cyanide kills a coyote by crippling
its central nervous system. . . ' , . . .

In deciding in favor of an M-44 experimental use prOgram,
the Administrator turned down the requests of the States of
Texas, California, and Wyoming to use the device on an emergency
basis to curb alleged heavy sheep losses from coyotes. Instead,

_these States and other parties may request experimental use per-
mits from EPA. '

. The permits will be issued only for non-Federal lands, in
light of a 1972 Presidential Order which prohibits the use of
all chemical toxicants on Federally owned lands.

Under the permit system, users of the M-44 will be required
to collect data on the environmental impact 0f the device under
conditions of controlled field use. This is the type of infor—
gmation needed by EPA for an informed decision on what uses, if
any, are appropriate for sodium cyanide in the M444 in the future.

Data to be collected under the permit system.will include:

1. The degree of coyote control which can be achieved by
the M-44 without causing unreasonable adverse effects on man
or the environment.’ '

2. Reliable information on the effectiveness of the M—44
in preventing or controlling sheep losses.

3. A comparison of the effectiveness and cost of the M—44
with non-chemical means of control, including denning, shooting,
trapping and protective measures applied directly to sheep such
as bells and repellant odors.

The Administrator has denied the request of the M—44's sole
manufacturer to register sodium cyanide for use in the device at
this time. Despite some evidence that the M-44 is selective to
coyotes, further information is needed in this area and on the
question of the effectiveness of the M—44 in preventing live-
stock losses. The sole manufacturer of the device is the M-44
Safety Predator Control Company of Midland, Texas.

EPA officials will be working closely over the next several
weeks with those States wishing to obtain an experimental use
FGIISf to develOp the Specific requirements for use programs.

Of particular concern will be the establishment of reliable means
for generation and collection of the information required by the
experimental program. Assurance will also be made for adequate
supervision of the use of the M-44 device. EPA expects that the
programs develOped for the first one or two States receiving

permits will serve as models for any additional permit requests.

The M-44, which has never been registered by EPA,differs
markedly in certain respects from cyanide devices in use at the
time the March 1972 Order was issued. The M-44 appears to present
substantially less hazard to humans than the explosive devices
previously used. ' ‘

(more)

 




Reports available to EPA show that the M-44 has been exten-
sively used in some States with no reported human injuries. -
Some evidence is also available that the M-44 is more selective
to coyotes than devices used in the past. In addition, the

M-44 cannot endanger non—target species through secondary

poisoning, as can some of the other chemicals which were used
for predator control prior to 1972.

Secondary poisoning results when another animal, such as a
fox, an eagle or other wild bird, preys upon the animal which

Ainitially ingestsﬁ the poison and is killed by the chemical re-
maining in the carcass.

Notice of EPA's M-44 action will appear soon in the Federal-
Register.

Thank you for contacting me to urge my opposition to legislation introduced by
Congressman Leggett to exempt the tuna fishing industry from compliance with
the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

As a member of the Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation and the Environment
Subcommittee of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, I deeply appre-
ciate having the benefit of your views concerning the need to uphold the provisions
of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and can assure you that I shall weigh them
_,.....heavily during my upcoming consideration of Congressman Leggett's proposal.
I do not believe that the failure of the tuna fishing industry to minimize the sense—
less killing of porpoises should serve as a reason to sanction further killings of
. these rare and threatened animals.

Once again, thank you for contacting me. With best wishes for you, I am

MOST URGENT

 

To Humanitarians:

Friday, the 13th, could be a most unlucky day for thousands
upon thousands of dolphins. The full Committee of the House Mer-
chant Marine and Fisheries will be convened by the new chairman,
John Murphy of New York, to amend the Marine Mammal Protection
Act (bypassing the House Subcommittee on Fish, Wildlife, Con-
servation and the Environment chaired by Congressman Robert
Leggett of California).

Congressman MDrphy'has prepared a bill which would weaken
the Nhrine Mammal Protection Act and the new regulations, allow-
ing 78,000 dolphins a year to be killed (156,000 for the two
years covered by the bill). A full observer program would be
instigated for one year only. i

It is important to note that the bill would raise the quota
from 59,000 to 78,000, a net increase of 19,000 and reduce pro-
tection for depleted Species. The observer program which is the
heart of any real effort to protect the dolphins is formally
scheduled for only one year and it would severely restrict the
observer's functions.

This is retrogression with a vengeance to serve the sel-
fish appetite of a greedy industry. It is totally unnecessary.
The tuna industry can not only survive, it can flouriSh under
present regulations. With intelligent captaining, they can set
on porpoise with a bare minimum of dolphin mortality. The in—
dustry's present manuvering flouts the continued protection of
the depleted dolphin under the guise of economic expediency.
The facts do not support the tuna industry's complaints. Following
are some points you may wish to make in communicating with your
own Congressman and members of the Committee.

 

1) The 78,000 quota is shockingly high and would abrogate
the new regulations promulgated by Secretary of Commerce Juanita
Kreps. The quota should be maintained at previously established
figures and progressively lowered each year as seining techniques
become increasingly effective. Lowered quotas should be written
into law, not allowed on an and/or question.

2) The full observer program shou1d be firmly established
and not restricted to data collection. The heart of any real
effort to protect the dolphins is a full observer program where-
by government observers are placed on tuna purse seiners to see
whether or not regulations are adhered to and to count dead dol-
phins.

3) The Administration is preparing a bill which should be
ready very soon. It is unwise to accept a new bill without weigh-
ing alternative bills. Reasoned consideration should be given to
the Administration bill, and other bills which may be introduced
by other interested Congressmen before any action is taken. The
Marine Mammal Protection Act must not be hastily amended.

Please telegraph, telephone or write to as many of the
Committee members listed below as you can. Ask that no action
be summarily taken without full consideration of alternatives,
both administrative and legislative. ‘In writing to Chairman
MUrphy, please ask him.to reconsider the provisions of his bill.

We are informed that present plans call for a full Committee
mark Up early in the week of May 16th. When this letter reaches
you, please try to contact the legislators. SPEED IS IMPORTANT!

SOCIETY FOR ANIMAL PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION
P. O. Box 3719
Georgetown Station
Washington, D. C. 20007

May 11, 1977

MOST URGENT

 

To Humanitarians:

Friday, the 13th, could be a most unlucky day for thousands
upon thousands of dolphins. The full Committee of the House Mer-
chant Marine and Fisheries will be convened by the new chairman,
John Murphy of New York, to amend the Marine Mammal Protection
Act (bypassing the House Subcommittee on Fish, Wildlife, Con-
servation and the Environment chaired by Congressman Robert
Leggett of California).

Congressman Murphy has prepared a bill which would weaken
the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the new regulations, allow-
ing 78,000 dolphins a year to be killed (156,000 for the two
years covered by the bill). A full observer program would be
instigated for one year only. 5

It is important to note that the bill would raise the quota
from 59,000 to 78,000, a net increase of 19,000 and reduce pro-
tection for depleted species. The observer program which is the
heart of any real effort to protect the dolphins is formally
scheduled for only one year and it would severely restrict the
observer's functions.

This is retrogression with a vengeance to serve the sel-
fish appetite of a greedy industry. It is totally unnecessary.
The tuna industry can not only survive, it can flourish under
present regulations. With intelligent captaining, they can set
on porpoise with a bare minimum of dolphin mortality. The in-
dustry's present manuvering flouts the continued protection of
the depleted dolphin under the guise of economic expediency.

The facts do not support the tuna industry's complaints. Fbllowing
are some points you may wish to make in communicating with your
own Congressman and members of the Committee.

1) The 78,000 quota is shockingly high and would abrogate
the new regulations promulgated by Secretary of Commerce Juanita
Kreps. The quota should be maintained at previously established
figures and progressively lowered each year as seining techniques
become increasingly effective. Lowered quotas should be written
into law, not allowed on an and/or question.

2) The full observer program should be firmly established
and not restricted to data collection. The heart of any real
effort to protect the dolphins is a full observer program where—
by government observers are placed on tuna purse seiners to see
whether or not regulations are adhered to and to count dead dol-
phins.

3) The Administration is preparing a bill which should be
ready very soon. It is unwise to accept a new bill without weigh-
ing alternative bills. Reasoned consideration should be given to
the Administration bill, and other bills which may be introduced
by other interested Congressmen before any action is taken. The
Marine Mammal Protection Act must not be hastily amended.

Please telegraph, telephone or write to as many of the
Committee members listed below as you can. Ask that no action
be summarily taken without full consideration of alternatives,
both administrative and legislative. In writing to Chairman
NMrphy, please ask him to reconsider the provisions of his bill.

We are informed that present plans call for a full Committee
mark Up early in the week of May 16th. When this letter reaches
you, please try to contact the legislators. SPEED IS IMPORTANT!

Dear-Joan:

Thank you for your May 2 letter expressing your views about
H. R. 6133,.the Endangered Species Act, and your support for
protection of the bobcat.

As you may know, this bill was marked up on April 27 by the
Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation and the
Environment. The subcommittee adopted a substitute sponsored

by Hon.J0hn B. Breaux that increased from two to three years

the duration of the reauthorization and made several modifications

of the existing law.

H. R. 6133 was passed in the full committee on Merchant Marine

& Fisheries, as amended, on May 5. I voted for and supported

H. R. 6133 in the committee meeting. I have noted your views

that the American bobcat must be protected, and your concern about
the danger of extinCtion of this animal. I will remember your
'concerns during my future consideration of this bill.

Again, thank you for contacting me, and with best wishes for
you, I am m

Sincerely yours,

Thank you for your letter expressing your support for
H. R. 66, the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the
Endangered Species Act, and H. J. Res. 448; and
expressing your concern about the unnecessary slaughter
of our dolphins.

Although the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife Conserva-

of H. R. 66, a bill to discourage the use of painful devices
in the trapping of animals, I can assure you that I shall

do everything possible to secure prompt and thorough
Subcommittee review of this measure.

Both the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered
Species Act have done a great deal to preserve animals
threatened by extinction. In View of the pressing need to
protect these animals, I can assure you that I would not
sanction any effort to weaken these Acts and, in fact, I
am anxious to see that the Marine Mammal Protection Act is
strengthened so as to prevent the unnecessary slaughter of
our dolphins.

H. J. Res. 448, which would protect the great whales by
imposing an embargo on the fishing products of nations
engaged in commercial whaling, is also awaiting considera-
tion by my Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife Conservation
and Environment. I share your concern about the threatened
extinction of these fine mammals, and am hopeful that
consideration of H. J. Res. 448 can be expedited.

would ban the use of beagle dogs in tests for chemical and biological
weapons.

I am sure you will be interested to know that the Senate
adopted an amendment to the Military Procurement Bill, H.R. 14592,
banning the use of beagles in such tests. However, no such provi-
sion was adopted by the House.

Because of differences in the Military Procurement Bill as
passed by the House and Senate, this legislation is now under con“
sideration by a House~Senate conference committee where the differences
between the two bills will be resolved.

At this time I can't predict whether the conference commit—
tee will retain the provision pertaining to beagle dogs because the
members are still meeting in closed session. However, you may be
assured that I will have your views in mind when this legislation
comes before the House for a vote in the future.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mrs. Davenport:

Thank you for your letter expressing opposi-
tion to proposed reorganization plans to change
the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee.

There has been a general discussion of re-
organizing various committees of the House. No
final decision has been reached on the question
and I would expect considerable opposition to
such a move.

You may be assured I will have your thoughts
in mind if the matter comes up in the House for
action. I can understand your concern.

With kind regards.

Dear Mrs. Peschka:

Thank you for contacting me to urge my support for H. R. 66, a bill to restrict
the use of steel leg-hold traps.

You will be pleased to know that my Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife
Conservation and the Environment held two days of hearings on H. R. 66 during
November. Although further hearings are expected on this legislation, no date
has been set. I appreciate your sharing your views with me and can assure you
that I shall weigh them heavily during my further consideration of H. R. 66.

Once again, thank you for contacting me.

Dear Ms. Watts:

Thank you for your letter urging prompt action
upon H. J. Res. 448, a bill to prohibit the importaw
tion of certain products from nations now threatening
the extinction of whales. As a member of the Fisheries
and Wildlife Conservation Subcommittee and as a in~
dividual deeply concerned about the continued existence

of whales, I appreciate your sharing your views with
me.

As you may already know, the Subcommittee held
hearings on H. J. Res. 448 on June 3rd and on June 13th.
Due to the complexity of this legislation and the Sub~
committee's work on legislation to extend U. S. terri—
torial fishing waters to 200 miles, the Subcommittee
is not expected to consider H. J. Res. 448 further until
the August Recess has ended. Let me assure you that I
shall keep our mutual interest in protecting whales from
extinction in mind during my further consideration of
H. J. Res. 448.

Once again, thank you for writing.

With best wishes for you, I am

Dear Friends:

Many thanks for contacting me to express your support for
legislation addressing the issue of live animal research. Please
excuse my sending you a form letter. However, the volume of mail
on this issue has been overwhelming.

Please be aware that I truly share your disposition on proposals
attempting to rectify this practice. As a co—sponsor of H.R. 282,
the Humane Experimentation Bill,2uu1as one of the four original
sponsors of H.R. 4805, the Research Modernization Act, you may be
assured of my continued support for proposals attempting to postively‘
_deal with this issue. Furthermore, I am fOrwarding your correspondence
to your Representative in the United States Congress in an effort to
make your views known.'

Again, thank you for contacting me to share your thoughts and I
hope that you will not hesitate to call on me if'I may ever be of any
assistance which is within my jurisdiction as a Member of Congress
to render.

With best regards,

Sincerely,

Dear Friends:

Many thanks for your correspondence regarding the use of animals in medical
esearch. Unfortunately, because time does not permit a personal response to
the inmerons inquiries on this subject, I must reply with a form letter.

The Committee on Science and Technology has actively monitored legislation
similar to that about which you are concerned. As a Committee member and one of
the original cosponsers of the Research Modernization Act, I feel H.R. 4805
represents a concerted effort to ameliorate the inhumane practices resulting
from the use of live animals in scientific research. For example, H.R. 4805
will establish a Center for Alternate Research which will concentrate on the
development of scientific methods minimizing the use of live animals. Addi-
tionally, I have cosponsored H.R.282, the Humane Methods of Research Act, which,
like H.R. 4805, addresses and attempts to rectify the inhumane practices arising
from the use of animals in scientific research.

While the use of animals has been an integral part of scientific research
and may be necessary in specific research projects, we must guard against un~ .
'necessary inhumane practices. Though much remains to be accomplished, please be
assured that my actions have and will continue to work towards positive efforts
in minimizing the occurence of inhumane research techniques on animals.

Again, many thanks for sharing your Views. If I can be of any further
assistance, please feel free to get in touch.

With kind regards, I am

Dear Joan:

Thank you for for taking the time to contact me about the re-
authorization of the Endangered Species Act.

I am pleased to report to you that the House Committee on Mer—
chant Marine and Fisheries, of which l am a member, unanimously
reported out a three—year reauthorization bill. I actively supported
this legislation because I believe it is our nation's most effective
means of protecting America's vanishing wildlife.

Again, thank you for expressing to me your concerns about this
matter. Please feel free to contact my office again when issues of
concern to you arise or if I may be of assistance in any way.

Warm regards.

Sincerely,

Earl Hutto

Dear Joan:

Thank you for your letter concerning reauthorization of the
Endangered Species Act.

It is anticipated that hearings on this particular legislation will
be held before the Fisheries and Wildlife Subcommittee of the House
Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries in February and I look
forward to hearing from all interested parties. The Endangered
Species Act is our nation's most effective law for protecting wildlife
which might otherwise become extinct. Although some changes may
be needed to make the legislation more workable, I would oppose any
effort to weaken the scope of this law. You can be assured that I
will keep your thoughts in mind during subcommittee consideration.

Again, thank you for your concern and for your letter. If I
can ever be of assistance to you, please feel free to get back in
touch with me.

Warm regards.

Sincerely,

6/
