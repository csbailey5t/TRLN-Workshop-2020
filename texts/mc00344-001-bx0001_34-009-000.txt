Christine Stevens, President

Washington, DC 20007

Dear Ms. Stevens,:

By now you may have seen the enclosed article, which appears in
the April 1985 issue of Cat Fancy Magazine. If not, I wanted to send
you a copy for your files.

Too, I would like to ask your personal opinion of the article.
The column has not been given the space I had hoped for in the
beginning, so each article is necessarily short. But, nevertheless,
I'm interested in your opinion of the article as it appeared. Did
you find the article to be accurate? Was there anything I said that
I should not have said? Was there something that I should have
reported, but didn't?

Your frank opinion of this article, and the column concept
itself, is very important to me. I always want to improve the work
that I do, and feedback from those people featured in my writing is
always helpful.

In addition, I would be interested to know if anyone at your
shop received public reaction because of the story. I know that this
kind of thing is hard to guage, but I need to be sensitive to what
people think, so that I can do a good job with the series. The
objective, of course, is to help the public understand the various
humane organizations a little better.

Your comments will be most welcome. May I hear from you? I am,

Sincerely,

“Direct mail and donations
from individuals.”

That’s the answer you’re likely to get
when you ask an animal organization
about fund raising. And with only a few
exceptions, they’ll tell you that mem-
berships and donations are on the
upswing.

The Washington (D.C.) Humane
Society has seen its membership more
than double in the past five years.
“We’ve grown in spite of the economy,”
says President Jean Goldenberg.
“We’ve embarked on a campaign to
educate the community about what we
do. Prior to that we always went about
our business quietly.”

Goldenberg says the Society has
used a combination of direct mail and
public service announcements to edu-
cate the public. They’ve built a reputa-
tion for their programs, which include
anticruelty investigation, animal control,
rescue, adoption, education, training
and spay/neuter services. “We do a lot
of direct mail, and we’re aggressively
fund raising. But we back that up with
excellent programs,” Goldenberg says.

In the Washington metropolitan
area, there may be as many as 30 ani-
mal groups—all competing for a part of
the local'donors’ dollar. Goldenberg
says humane groups avoid fighting
among themselves for dollars by provid-
ing different services.

“That way we can all work in this
field and take care of business, without
stepping on each other’s toes,”
she says.

The Washington Animal Rescue
League is an example of a local animal
group with a well-defined niche. The
League specializes in animal adoption
and uses PSAs and print ads to publi-

 

cize its services. President Elizabeth
Kiernan reports that print ads are ef-
fective. “We get phone calls immediate-
ly. We get a rise in mail immediately,”
she says.

Anticruelty is a niche that Cleveland
Amory’s Fund for Animals fills. Glenn
Chase of their Washington office says:
“It’s visibility in the news media that’s
gotten us all the new members.”
Amory’s group is well known for rescuing
the goats on San Clemente Island, the
burros in the Grand Canyon and harp
seals in Newfoundland. Chase says
the Fund doesn’t use direct mail solicita-
tions regularly. Instead, they rely on
memberships and donations to support
their work.

The Animal Welfare Institute also
relies on memberships and individual
contributions. They also do some mer-
chandizing (Save the Whales T shirts,
etc.). John Gleiber, staff assistant,
says the Institute was established be—
cause there was no middle ground.
None Of the animal groups took the posi-
tion that it is necessary to use animals
in scientific research, but they must be
treated humanely. “We’re not antivivi-
sectionists,” Gleiber says.

The Institute has used celebrity
PSAs to publicize its educational mes-
sages. Gleiber says spots with Greg-
ory Peck, Jack Lord, Jason Robards and
Katherine Hepburn were arranged
through personal contacts. (Institute
President Christine Stevens’ husband
Roger is head of the Kennedy Center in
Washington.)

People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals (PETA) has found yet another

 

@ﬂ

 

 

 

   

niche to fill—animal rights. “There are
two distinctly different animal move-
ments—animal welfare and animal
rights,” says PETA cofounder Ingrid
Newkirk. “Animal welfare groups say if
you use animals you must treat them
kindly. Animal rights groups say we
have no right to use these animals at all,”
Newkirk explains. “Some people
won’t work with us because we’re too
radical. Others will only support
groups like ours.”

PETA has tried direct mail and has
hired a consultant to handle fund-raising

efforts. But its current strategy, publi-
cizing its efforts through the news media,
and distributing a pair of award-win-
ning public service announcements, has
been effective.

“If I can talk to one person on the
street, that’s fine,” Newkirk says. “If I can
talk atga gathering of 200, that’s good.
But if I can get into the Washington Post,
that’s a lot better.

“When we do our fund raising, we
mention the story. The fact that it’s been
in the news provided more recognition
to the issue,” Newkirk says. “People
say, ‘Oh, yes, I remember that. l sup-
port that. lt’s worthwhile.’ But if they’ve
never heard of us before, it’s harder.”

PETA’s public service announce-
ments are another success story. The
two spots, “Hot Dog” and “Chilly Dog”
won the bronze medal at the 26th Annual
International Film and Television Fes-
tival in New York. Judged third best PSA
in the world, behind the first place
“Mormon Church” and second place
“United Way,” the two spots cost
PETA less than $2,000 to produce and
distribute. (PETA donated the spots to
local humane societies and to the Ameri-
can Humane Association. The spots
were distributed via satellite from Wash-
ington to local stations in January
1984)

The key to PETA’s PSA success is
Mike Handley, a local broadcast narrator
who donated his time, enthusiasm and
talent. Handley came up with the idea for
the two spots which point out the dan—
gers of leaving a dog in a car during hot
weather and leaving a dog outside in
the winter. PETA held some fund rais-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

/'~ :I

ers, raising about $1 ,200. Handley got
several Washington broadcasters to
donate their time and equipment.

On the wildlife side, Greenpeace,
the international environmental organi-
zation, employs a strategy similar to
PETA’s. They have professional broad-
casters volunteer to produce their
PSAs. They work at keeping a high pro-
file in the news media. And they use
direct mail.

Greenpeace National Media Coor-
dinator Peter Dykstra says James Watt
and Ann Gorsuch-Burford motivated

people to respond to direct mail solicita—
tions. “Watt was recognized as the
second most prolific fund raiser for the
Republican party, behind the presi-
dent himself,” Dykstra says. “At the
same time he’s been recognized as

the polarizing factor that motivated a lot
of peOpIe to become supportive of the
environmental movement.”

With Watt and Gorsuch-Burford
gone, wildlife and environmental organi-
zations, who get donations largely
through direct mail, are working new
strategies.

lt’s ironic that environmental groups
use direct mail, which consumes a lot of
trees. Dykstra admits it can be waste-
ful and inefficient because a “good” re-
sponse is only about three to five per-
cent. But he says, “In a sense it’s ex-
tremely efficient because it frees our
staff to work on issues.”

The World Wildlife Fund—U.S. gets
most of its funds from direct mail. Press
Officer Neill Heath asks, “What’s the
alternative to direct mail? It’s justified
because we’re mainly concerned
about tropical forests, and we don’t use
tropical forests trees to make paper.”

Heath says the Fund has additional
income from a commercial license on
their panda logo, as well as some
foundation and corporate support. But
most of their funding comes from di-
rect mail, with appeals to the upscale
small donor genuinely interested in in-
ternational conservation.

Just up the street from the World
Wildlife Fund, another animal group,
Friends of the National Zoo (FONZ)
supports international conservation re-

 

 

 

 

_ The Washington
’ Animal Rescue
League

     

  
  

search and education carried out by
zoo scientists. FONZ President Sabin
Robbins says profile studies show

their members above average in educa—
tion and income and belonging to oth-
er wildlife organizations. They support
FONZ because they believe the 200 is
playing a significant role in wildlife
conservation.

FONZ has produced radio, televi-
sion and print PSAs, with disappointing
reSUIts. Robbins says: “You can’t cal-
culate the overall image-making we’ve
created. We may be softening them up

I

 

 

4O

 

        

 




 

 

 

 

 

so that when they get a direct response
vehicle, like direct mail, they’re more
likely to respond favorably.”

Robbins reports that FONZ gets the
bulk of its new members through direct
mail. He’s tried all sorts of pitches,
even a sweepstakes. In the beginning he
got a three or four percent return. Now,
he says, it’s running from one to one and
a half percent. “We’re having a harder
and hardertime getting good lists,” Rob-
bins explains.

Defenders of Wildlife, an national
animal group based in Washington, also
gets most of its revenue from direct
mail. But that may change this year. Ac-
cording to Public Relations Director
Dan Smith, “We’re going out actively this
year to get foundation funding.” De-
fenders focuses its efforts on endan-
gered species, the National Wildlife
Refuges and wildlife management on
public lands. Smith says they had
some small success with foundations
last year. But he says, “Ours isn’t any-
thing like the Wilderness Society’s suc-
cess of some $750,000 from the Mel-
lon Foundation for their economics
program.”

There are hundreds of nonprofit
groups working to better the world for
animals, domestic and wild, all fishing
for donations from essentially the same
pool. Who are the fish? Each group
has a theory about why people donate to
animal causes:

“A lot of people concur with the Al-
bert Schweitzer theory that a society will
be judged on how well it treats ani-
mals. The abuse of any helpless crea-
ture is intolerable, whether it be old

 

 

 

 

 

 

people or children or animals, says
Jean Goldenberg.

“People who really care about ani-
mals have the humanitarian spirit.
They’re the ones who care about peo-
ple and do things for people. They’re not
blind to suffering wherever they see
it,” says Elizabeth Kiernan.

John Gleiber believes, “They’re the
ones with a tremendous awareness of
the importance of the world around us,
not just the animals, but the total
environment.”

According to lngrid Newkirk: “Any-

 

 

body and everybody.”

“People who care about internation-
al conservation. People who believe that
what goes on outside our borders is
very important,” says Neill Heath.

“People who want the environment
and all its components, including wild-
life, to be preserved so they can enjoy
it,” says Dan Smith.

“There’s a growing and overwhelm-
ing conscience about the humane treat-
ment of animals, that they’re not here
simply to be exploited,” says Peter
Dykstra.

The successful fund raisers seem to
have three things in common: They rec-
ognize the importance of media strate-
gy and planning and keep a high media
profile through public service spots
and effective news publiCity. They pick
their issues, taking a lead with some,
and stepping back in others. And they
look to their membership for volunteer
assistance.

A PROFILE OF
MILTON GLASER

by Jayne Cohen

He designed New York Magazine and
Grand Union supermarkets. His posters
and book jackets comprise a history of
award-winning commercial art.

But there is another side to Milton
Glaser. This prodigy of the market-
place—who redesigned Paris-Match
overnight—spends 15 to 20 percent of
his time creating art for the benefit of
nonprofit organizations. A partial list of
his clients reads like a Who’s Who of
public service groups: the United Na-
tions Children’s Fund (UNICEF),
Myasthenia Gravis Foundation, the New
York Zoological Society, Volunteers in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Service to America (VISTA), the New
York Landmarks Preservation Com-
mission and countless musical groups.

Perhaps the most celebrated public
service project he has conceived is the “l
V New York” campaign. Sighted as
far afield as the Great Wall of China, the
ubiquitous logo has spawned clones
the world over. Glaser also executes
most of the posters in the campaign,
highlighting a different regional New
York festival every season. Celebrat-
ing events like spring wildflowers and fall
foliage, the posters are quickly be-
coming collectors’ items. According to
Bern Rotman, director of communica-
tions for the New York State Department
of Commerce, sponsor of the project:
“Long after the festivals are over, they
survive as art.” But for Glaser, the acid
testis not attracting imitators or becom-
ing a “collectible” artist—the bottom
line is functionalism. He scores high
marks there, too, from Rotman: “His
work has been absolutely successful in
promoting tourism. We couldn’t have
been better served in the field of
visual arts.”

For the artist, working in the public
service sector is somewhat different
from the commercial arena. Budget-
ary considerations may affect such artis-
tic choices as use of color or black and
white. But as Glaser points out, the big-
gest challenge in designing for non-
profits is that “they are all worthwhile, so
what the artist must do is single out
what is unique about the organization.
He should be specific, zero in. It
helps to know as much as possible
about the group.”

Poison gas tests on dogs:

‘Tip of the iceberg?’

By Dana Adams Schmidt
Staff correspondent of
The Christian Science Monitor

7/ly/73 Washington

A US. Air Force plan to expose 200
beagle puppies to poisonous fumes to
gauge the effects on humans is
roundly condemned by humane
society officials.

The officials call the experiments -
to be conducted late this year or early
next year at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base in Ohio under a $1.2
million research contract — as “the

tip of the iceberg” of experiments on
animals in the Unites States.

The Air Force, which has the
research contract with the University
of California, says the animals will
not be used to test poison gases or any
chemical or biological warfare
agents.

They will, however, test “effects of
flourocarbons to determine toxicity
levels from fumes from fire ex-
tinguishers; effects of fumes given off
by freezone; effects of methyol hydra-
zene fumes from propellants; effects
of carbon monoxide and hydrogen
cyanide fumes given off by burning
plastics in aircraft fires . "

For other test programs

Says the Air Force: “Testing is low-
level in nature and long-term in.
duration. In this type of testing most
of the test animals will not die. ”

But some will not survive, because
the Air Force also says that “animals
whose health is affected or whose
lifespan is altered will be humanely
destroyed.”

However, “animals not so affected
will be made available for other test
programs."

A spokesman for the Washington,
D.C., branch of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
(SPCA) said that its offices have been
inundated with letters protesting the
Air Force’s experiments.

“While we are not antivivi-
sectionists in principle, we do find
these particular experiments a little
obscené," he said.

“Most people who know beagles as
pets will suffer a real identity crisis
when they hear the details.”

Statistics cited

- SPCA officials quote statistics from
Rutgers University’s College of Agri-
cultural and Environmental Sciences,
which stated that in 1971 about 500,000
dogs of all kinds were used for
laboratory research in the US.

In addition, the figures show, labo-
ratories used . 45 million rodents,
700,000 rabbits, 200,000 cats, 85,283
primates, 46,624 swine, 22,961 sheep,
1,724,279 birds, 15 to 20 million frogs,
190,415 turtles, 61,176 snakes, and
51,005 lizards in the same year.

The Air Force contract was let by
the Aeronautical Systems Division of
the Air Force Systems Command for
work by the University of California
at the aerospace medical research
laboratory at Wright Patterson.

The contract for the supply of dogs
has not yet been let, although a notice
of intent has been published.

‘Debarking’ process
The Air Force explains that its

procedures are humane.

It says that the dogs are “de-
barked” before the experiments
through “a simple operation in which
a small piece of cartilage is removed
from their vocal cords. This is stan-
dard procedure used only when large
numbers of animals are to take part
in experiments indoors. It is a pain-
less operation."

It was not clear, however, whether
eliminating the dogs’ ability to bark
was for the sake of the dogs or for the

a. sakeiof the - laboratory technicians

who had to work With them.

According to the Air Force, “all
federal, state, and local laws as well
as principles of laboratory animal
care as outlined by the National
Academy of Sciences and HEW [De-
partment of Health, Education, and
Welfare] are strictly followed.”

The Air Force also said that the
Society for Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals concurs in these principles.

This was denied by the Washington,
D.C., SPCA which pointed out that it
works entirely through local branches
and has no national organization that
could lay down a national policy of the
kind mentioned by the Air Force.

Why beagles? The answer given by
the Air Force is that they are an
“inexpensive, purebred animal, ” that
they are frequently used for research
because they tend to be uniform in
- size and characteristics.

The specifications provide that they
should be purebred and six to nine
months in age, half male and half

HUMANE OFFICER'S REPORT - MONTH OF JUDY, 1973

This report is inconmlete due to the fact that
calls for our assistance were so numerous it wasn't
possible to get an accurate count of the total as
we go to press. We have several Humane Officers
and also several investigators; Phil McCullough,
Sue Brydon, Penny Beeson, Nancy and Hal Uhey.
Between them they cover all the reported cases

all through the county.

 

 

Cases were investigated as follows: Ojai 3,

Port Hueneme 1, Ventura 1h, Camarillo 1, Oak View 3,
Oxnard 3, Santa Paula 3, Moorpark 2, Fillmore 1,
Foster Park 1, Rancho Sespe l, Nyland Acres 1,

E1 Rio 1, Thousand Oaks 1, Simi 8, Santa SUsana l.

 

Animals involved werexl 10 Cats, 61 Dogs, 9 Horses, 2 Goats, 1 Bird, 1 Raccoon.
Types of cases: Cruelty 10, Neglect 25, Abandonment 2.

Several of the cases this month involved neglect of animals owned by people
on vacation. Many people leave their animals in the hands of undependable
people. The "caretakers" often forget to feed the animals and in some cases
do not show up at all. Those that do'showaoften forget to put out enough
water or fail to check the chain - .often a tangled chain will make it im‘
possible for the animal to reach the watei'or food. One should be certain
that the person charged with caring for their animal is totally reliable.
and hopefully will Check the animal more than once during the day.

The U.S. Air Force wants to buy
200 beagle pups for laboratory use.

The dogs will have their vocal
cords permanently tied to keep
them from barking during experi-
ments. None of them will leave the
laboratories alive. ' _

The dogs are to be used as innocent
subjects in toxology research to test
the environmental impact of aviation-
related pollutants, such as fuel.

In, layman’s terms, this means the
puppies will be used in experiments
with poisonous gases. They will appar-
ently be forced to breathe carbon
monoxide fumes from burning plastics
commonly found in airports and air-
planes.

Air Force ofﬁcials claim the experi-
ments are unlikely to kill the dogs, but
they added that any dog which suffered
would be put to sleep.

“Those which survive,” said a
spokesman, “will be used for other
tests. They are laboratory animals.”
The Air Force furtherjustiﬁed operat-
. ing on the dogs’ vocal cords by saying
that the animals would be “rendered
mute in accordance With protocols of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals.” .

The Society for the Prevention of
’Cruelty to Animals has no such
“p‘rotocols”

In the first place, the SPCA is not

 

'BEAGLE PUP may give his life

in toxology research

a nation-wide organization. That is,
each office acts completely indepen-
dent of any other ofﬁce. The SPCA
in New York has absolutely no con-
nection, besides the name and purpose
of the group, with the SPCA in Los
Angeles.

Marion Wilson, of the Washington
area SPCA told MIDNIGHT, “I don’t
know which SPCA they could possibly
be referring to. The Washington
Humane Society certainly does not con-
done this practice.”

MIDNIGHT then talked to Mrs.

._ Roger Stevens, head of the Animal

Welfare Institute in Washington, DC.
and one of America’s foremost

authorities on‘ animal welfare. Mrs.
Stevens said the Air Force spokes-
man’s claim that the SPCA condoned
devocalizing the dogs was “certainly
not an accurate statement.”

Mrs. Stevens also said that it is quite
common to cut a dog 3 vocal cords
to keep them from barking during
experiments. “This shouldn’t be neces-
sary,” she said. “Ifa dog is happy and
contented, he won’t make much noise.
Removing a dog’s ability to make
sounds deprives him of his only means
‘of letting his master know he is hurt
or in trouble.”

While some experiments are con-
ducted with a minimum of discomfort

to the. subjects by researchers con-

cerned about the welfare oftheir dogs
Mrs. Stevens says that very often ani-
mals are forced to undergo agony in
the interest of science.

“Toxology research'in particular can
be terrible for the dogs,” said Mrs. Ste-
vens who plans to investigate the mat—
ter further.

The dogs already have one champion
—Congressman Les Aspin of Wiscon-
sin. In a statement last month Aspin
said, “Literally thousands of dog lovers
like myself won’t stand by quietly."’

And he was right. Since Aspin’s
office brought the situation to public
attention, telegrams and letters have
poured into his ofﬁce from all over the
U.S., Canada, and Britain.

“This is the greatest response we’ve
ever had to a single issue,’
MIDNIGHT was told by Aspin s legis-
lative assistant, Phil Stanford. “We
have written to the secretary of the U.S.
Air Force, but so far we have received
no response.”

Stanford believes that the case of.
the 200 beagle pups is just part of a
larger experiment with an estimated '
budget of $3. 6 million.

Confining Dogs to Cages
Considered Unhumonitorion

EDMONTON," Alberta (AP)
—- Confining a dog toa cage
with-out exercise is contrary to
everything that is humanitari-
an and to the training of a
veterinarian.

This statement was made

by Dr. David .Secord, director
of the University of Alberta’s
Health S c i e n c e 5 Animal
Centre, during a speech to the
U. S. Department of Agricul-
ture’s board which is review-
ing and revising regulations
concerning animals used for
scientific research. Dr. Se-
cond. who is also yessociate

professor of surgery was in-
vited to speak on behalf of the .,
Animalamelﬁarewlnstitute, an «~
international organization that
has long been .active in insur-g
ing the humane treatment of
research animals.

The care and treatment
program at the University of.
Alberta for animals used in.
research projects was initiat-
ed under the direction of Dr.,,
Secord in 1961. This university
was the first in Canada to‘
adopt such a program and has i

new house across the Mary-
land line. The apartment,
the exact same digs occupied
by, Vice President and Mrs.
“Jamison, is now the

ington.
The reason for the abrupt

change in the Cromers’ life- '

style is the first major reno-
vating job . on, the British

ambassador’s residence in‘

years. The handsome Geor-
gian mansion, designed by
famed British architect Sir
Edward Lutyens, is getting
central air-conditioning for
the first time and a com-
pletely new rewiring job,
both of which mean a recon-
struction prOgram that may
take the better part of a year.

The Cromers have leased it
for nines-months beginning
August 1., It’s taking the
month of July Just to get. out

all the Secret Service para-e

phernalia installed for the
Agnews. The Government
Services Administration is
removing at least a dozen TV

.. monitors Scattered through-

out the Sheraton Park, “phe-

MAGAZINES were bidding
‘up to $200; 000 for reprint
rights on Rose Kennedy’s
memoirs, for which Double-
day paid a, cool 51% million.
Reports that there Wasn’t
enough interest in Rose’s
reprint rights to get more
than $75,000 were circulated
by a rival magazine eager to
discourage rival bids. .The

book, that is thus far unti—A

Kennedy’s diary—500 to 600
pages of diary-plus tape

be “very moving.”

novel at the printers, which

~~ Doubleday has on a _ r.» - --
«scheduie w "e " . . a 1 f
publication by late fall. Why

the big hurry? Timeliness, of
course.

It’s about an American
President’s dealings with the
USSR. and involves the
possibility of the President’s
impeachment. Said to be a

real gripper, “Come Nineveh -

and Tyre” will be Allen’s
fifth novel dealing with the
same characters who made

their debut in ‘fAdvise and,

Christine Stevens, wife of.
the chairman of the Kenne- 5-.
dy Center, is trying to organ- ““
ize a boycott of Japanese "
goods in America to stop the -'
Japanese from killing fin
whales. At the London meet-
ing of the International?

Whaling Commission a cou-
ple of weeks ago, a majority
of the countries favored a
moratorium on commercial
lkilling of the scarce whales.
But the required three-
fourths majority was not
forthcoming. The Russians

did say they would phase out .

in two years, but the Japa-
nese voted not even to do
that.

Preservationists may even
picket Prime Minister Tanaka
while he is here later this

'month. .But a boycott—the

language of the marketplaCe

nese more. The gutsy Chris-
tine, who has done as much
or more than any AmeriCa'n
to help dumb animals in and
around our land, ‘went to
London as representative of
theAnimal Welfare Institute
and American Friends of the
Earth. She’ is organizing the
boycott with the World
Federation for the Protec-
tion, of Animals.

The reason for the abrupt

signed by British architect Sir

means a reconstruction pro-

BY MICHAEL FROME

Steps on the Long Road

he Committee on Appropria-

tions of the House of Repre-

sentatives is one of the most

powerful institutions in Wash-
ington. A President may draft and
submit a budget, but this Committee
shares control of the purse strings.
Nevertheless, it might also be called
One of Washington’s most backward
institutions. If you as a concerned
citizen or as spokesman for a grass
roots organization were to come here
to testify, let us say, before the Sub—
committee ‘on Interior Appropria-
tions, on a matter dealing with the
budget of the national parks, national
forests, national wildlife refuges, Bu-
reau of Land Management, or Bu-
reau of Outdoor Recreation, all im-
portant conservation—related agencies,
you would be astonished at the recep-
tion you receive and at the whole
procedure.

It could hardly be called a shining
example of democracy in action. You
would report to an anteroom on the
third ﬂoor of one of the oldest sec-
tions of the Capitol. Here you wait
your turn before going into the next
room, where the Subcommittee is in
session. You are not allowed to enter
in advance in order to hear other
Witnesses, on grounds of lack of
space. But such cramped quarters
are not in keeping with the Congres-
sional outburst of afﬂuence of recent
years. If other Committees can be
indulged with expensive facilities in
the plush Rayburn Ofﬁce Building,
why does the Appropriations Com-
mittee, with all its clout, deny itself
a bit of the same?

Witnesses testify Virtually in closed
hearing. As someone concerned with
ﬁsh and wildlife, you might like to
be present when the director of the
agency involved appears for ques-
tioning on his budget, perhaps to
absorb a viewpoint in preparation of

your own statement. This is impos-
sible. There is not even room for
staff aides of Subcommittee mem-
bers, despite the essential nature of
their work. The press is not encour—
aged. The average citizen witness is
likely to be given his ﬁve minutes, a
kindly word from the chairman, and
ushered out.

The deﬁciencies in this closely
guarded procedure of the Appro-
priations Committee under its aging
Chairman, Representative George H.
Mahon, of Texas, illustrates the chal—
lenges in making Congress, and our
whole political system, truly respon-
sive to the needs and desires of the
people. Some progress has indeed
been made. Until recent years it was
impossible to determine how mem-
bers of the House voted on key
issues. Now, as part of the process of
Congressional reform, the votes are
recorded by teller so that each mem-
ber of the House must commit him-
self before the public. Unfortunately,
a well-sounding piece of legislation
is apt to be emasculated by crippling
amendments so the ﬁnal act is rend-
ered meaningless—but yet the Wise
Congressman will be able to say,
with a cagey smile, “I voted for it
and did the best I could, didn’t I?”
This will explain why ratings on en-
vironmental votes issued by many
conservation organizations are based
on amendments and test rules, as
well as on the ﬁnal acts themselves.

It is unfortunate that government,
in general, still appears to lack sen—
sitivity to the dangers facing our en-
vironment. The National Govern
ment, in particular, seems willing
and eager to spend billions of tax-

:payers’ dollars pouring concrete into

highways and dams instead of in pro-
tecting our vanishing natural assets.

A friend of mine, a pilot of high
reputation and competency, wrote

the following words recently:

“Years ago, when I ﬁrst started ﬂy-
ing over the Mississippi River delta
country, there were birds by the mil-
lions, countless snakes, alligators and
ﬁsh. Pollution has killed the pelicans
to near extinction—not one of the
old Louisiana ﬂock is known to be
still alive. Snakes are all gone; I
haven’t seen one this year. I have
seen ﬁsh rotting in such huge masses
you could not bear the smell, and
even gators, belly-up and rotting in
the sun. After pollution kills the
birds, ﬁsh and reptiles, how long has
man?”

Based on such observations, I sup-
pose that one could allow himself to
be overcome with a sense of pessi-
mism or fatalism, but this is only the
easy way out. Personally, I feel heart-
ened and optimistic over man’s ability
to surmount moral challenges and to
prove worthy of his role on earth.
Already the tide is turning; the en-
vironmental consciousness level is
rising on all fronts, as plainly demon-
strated in the last election.

Three of the worst anti-environ—
mentalists in the House of Represen-
tatives—Wayne Aspinall, of Colo-
rado; Walter Baring, of Nevada; and
John Kyl, of Iowa—went down to
defeat. Not even the generous cam-
paign contributions from lobbyists
and lawyers of corporate interests
could save Aspinall. And while Alan
Merson, who defeated him in the
primary lost out in the general elec-
tion, Mrs. Pat Schroeder, running in
an adjacent district, came in a win-
ner on an environmental platform.

Coloradans have been pointing the
way for the nation. In July, voters
rejected the bond issue promoted by
the Denver Water Board, the real
estate lobby, and the construction in—
dustry. In September, they ousted
Aspinall. In (Continued on page 138)

(Continued from page 50)

November, they registered a smash-
ing upset by electing Floyd Haskell,
a committed environmentalist, to the
United States Senate seat long held
by Gordon Allott, a Washington
front man for Western mining and
grazing. And, of course, they, voted
against bringing the 1976 Olympics
to Denver. By so doing they gave
voice to the rumblings felt through-
out the land, to the desire for re-
ordering priorities based on the qual-
ity of life, rather than on unending
development and growth.

ENVIRONMENTAL bond issues and
referendums carried right and left,
from one end of the country to the
other. In California, a million dollar
propaganda campaign underwritten
by petroleum, utilities, and real es-
tate interests failed to block voters
from approving Proposition 20, a
comprehensive program of coastline
conservation. Washington State also
approved shoreline protection. Mas-
sachusetts enacted an historic envi-
ronmental bill of rights, legally vali-
dating the people’s claim “to clean
air and water, freedom from exces-
sive and unnecessary noise, and to
the natural, scenic, historic and es-
thetic qualities of their environment.”

Moreover, the voters showed their
willingness to pay for a better envi-
ronment. New York approved by 2
to 1 a $1.15 billion bond issue to
ﬁnance cleaner air and water, and to
purchase forest preserves, wetlands,
and other open space. Florida au—
thorized $240 million to buy choice
endangered lands. In Missouri, alas,
after the Citizens Committee for
Conservation had collected 164,000
signatures, the people were denied
the right to vote on the proposed 1-
cent tax on soft drinks for conserva-
tion acquisition. A hostile Secretary
of State used an incredible technical-
ity (the lack of an enacting clause)
to wipe out the referendum—but it
will be back another time, beyond
doubt

The most heartening aspect of the
election was the elevation of environ-
mental consciousness and political
know-how at the grass roots. This is
where the democracy of survival
must make its stand (which is why
we give recognition and encourage-
ment to local individuals and groups
through the Field & Stream Environ-
mental Action Group). Question-
naires to candidates, and evaluations
of them, such as we ﬁrst devised in
1968, were used by groups in Ala—
bama, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee,
Wisconsin, California, Pennsylvania,
and elsewhere. Of twenty-eight can-
didates endorsed by the Georgia
League of Conservation Voters,
twenty came in as winners. These in-
clude Sam Nunn, the new United
States Senator, who had shown
promise as a member of the state

--‘w‘:-‘-fft-.“o.~h;~: .vvt« -

legislature in Georgia.

There were disappointments, of
course, including the defeats of Gov-
ernor Russell Peterson, of Delaware,
after his heroic position on protec-
tion of the coastal wetlands, and of
Jay Rockefeller in his race for Gov-
ernor of West Virginia on avstrong
anti-strip mining platform. But then
there was a pleasant surprise when
Thomas Salmon was elected Gover-
nor of Vermont on a pledge to save
the Green Mountains from land
speculators. In Montana, Polly
Holmes and Dick Colberg now join
Dorothy Bradley to evoke the en-
vironmental VieWpoint in the state
legislature. In Wisconsin, Doug La-
Follette, head of “Wisconsin’s Envi-
ronmental Decade,” was elected to
the state senate. In Minnesota, Dr.
Glenn Sherwood, professional wild—
life biologist and champion of the
prairie pothole ecosystem (see his
forthcoming article in FIELD &
STREAM on the Starkweather Pro-
ject), made it to the state house of
representatives. Even where I live,
in Fairfax County, Virginia, voters
elected a new chairman of the board
of supervisors, Jean Packard, on a
promise to slow growth and save
some of our remaining open space,
while another candidate, Marian Ag-
new, made a healthy showing on an
even stronger environmental plat-
form.

ALTHOUGH the subject of our en-
vironmental-vote ratings is ready for
retirement, a few comments received
from members of theUnited States
Senate and House of Representa-
tives, plus two or three corrections,
should be printed in this month’s
issue.

Representative William A. Steiger,
of Wisconsin, listed as Inadequate,
should have been Passable (as he
plainly Showed with sound voting in
October on strip mining and high—
ways). Representative Pierre du
Pont IV did not vote as reported in
favor of the Family Planning Serv—
ices and Research Act, which took
place before he was elected to the
House, and did vote to cut off fund-
ing for the SST (though neither af—
fects his rating). Representative
Dawson Mathis, of Georgia, appar-
ently has played a key role in block—
ing stream channelization projects
(which we would have recognized
had he ﬁlled in and mailed his ques—
tionnaire. We didn’t receive his form
before the stated deadline).

Senator Robert Dole, of Kansas,
wrote to us in a thoughtful tone to
complain that our “Rate Your Can—
didate” feature “must be classiﬁed as
confusing, misleading and unhelp-
ful.” Then he added: “In compiling
a voting analysis any organization or
publication has an obligation, if not

‘to Members of Congress, then at

Whamraqcs 47““: n,»

least to the public to make a reason-
able and meaningful selection of
votes from which ratings and evalu-
ations will be made.” Senator Lowell
P. Weicker, J r., of Connecticut, made
substantially the same point: “Both
Congress and the press must work to
achieve a higher degree of sophisti-
cation in interpreting Congressmnal
votes. You have valid criticisms of
Congress’ role in this—I have valid
criticisms. With increasing use of
‘vote indicators,’ we must both be
more industrious.”

This is undoubtedly true; we must
all be more industrious, and search
for deeper wisdom and strength. The
fact remains, however, that the
power structure in Congress—as ex-
empliﬁed by the House Appropria-
tions Committee, to which I referred
earlier—has continually endeavored
to shield its inner workings from the
public.

But despite its abundant ﬂaws,
Congress quite likely is still the most
representative legislative body found
in any nation at any time in history.
The people are the ultimate judge
of performance. But what should
really be the basis of judgment? Rep-
resentative Bob Eckhardt, of Texas,
in a note to FIELD & STREAM, said it
beautifully: “In voting on any issue,
I try to consider not only what is
best for citizens living today but
what is best for generations to
come.” In return, I present Mr.
Eckhardt—and his colleagues in law-
making everywhere—the following
guidepost from famed Henry Ward
Beecher:

“We should so live and labor in
our time that what came to us as
seed may go to the next generation
as blossom, and what came to us as
blossom may go then as fruit. This
is what we mean by progress.”

The object of the people, then, at
the crossroads and grass roots of
America, must be to encourage the
pragmatic politician to face the long
range environmental challenge as an
issue ringing with immediacy. In this
spirit, let the Committee doors open
wide and the light shine through!

a slightly bawdy refrain. Whether
it was the words or the excruciat-
ingly awful music, he never knew,
but the bear gave him a look of
deﬁnite disgust and ambled off into
‘ the woods.

ANOTHER time, while he stopped to
assess the problem of two bears
blocking his path, a low-ﬂying plane
spooked both them and him. He
stayed where he was, but the bruin
duo took off toward him at top
speed, and passed him, one to a
side, at 30 miles an hour.

Since he is a small man, one of
Richter’s real diﬂiculties is crossing
the many streams he encounters,
especially if a late thaw in the snow
pack or a vigorous storm has made
for high water. Often, horses can
traverse these mini- -ﬂoods, but, if
there is not a broad, dry, fallen log
nearby to use as a bridge, Richter
concedes that the risk is too great
for a man of his age and his eye-
sight, and turns back.

He also concedes that his primary
danger would be a bad fall in which
he broke a leg, necessitating rescue.

“The rescue part of it would not
be too serious,” he says, candidly.
“But bones don’t heal too well in
one’s seventies. I might never be
able to go packing again.”

That, for Richter, would be a
tragedy. For his solitary jaunts are
much more than mere weight-shed-
ding expeditions. Talking with him,
one gets the impression that, even
at 72, the world is too much with
him, in the laboratory, in the sudden,
urgent call for his know- how when
a great quake occurs somewhere on
the globe, in his long ﬁght for pub-
lic and private construction which
will withstand such upheavals and
thus save lives, in the demands
which society invariably makes on
men of scientiﬁc genius.

His wanderings are of the spirit,
not the body. They feed his need to
reassess his own phiIOSOphy of both
man and nature, to join them once
again in ancient, simple harmony.
That is why he deplores those who
never get out of their trailers and
houses-on-wheels, with their gadgets
and luxury, for he believes they
don’t even see the glory of their
surroundings, the wonder of the land
and sky.

That’s not for Richter.

A 30-pound pack and solitude;
for Richter, that’s the only way ’zt‘o

go.

SIGN OF THE TIMES? Maryland’s
largest power supplier, Baltimore
Gas & Electric Company, has
shelved plans for mammoth nuclear—
powered generator on Chesapeake
Bay. Reasons given include: slowing
growth rate of electricity use; prob-

lems Of ﬁnancing costly nuclear facil-
ities, and nationwide environmental
opposition to nuclear generation Of
electric power. . . . But Maryland
has many other serious environmen-
tal problems. As Matthew J. . Sei-
den, Of the Baltimore Sun reports,
state is not using strip mine recla-
mation fund—while unhealed
wounds in the land continue to lie
Open, deepened by erosion, pouring
rain-washed acids into Western
Maryland streams. Also in the west-
ern section, sportsmen are up in
arms over planned auto racing com-
plex outside Hagerstown, less than
two miles from Beaver Creek, noted
trout stream. Why has Department
of Natural Resources been gunshy
on the issue when its own ﬁsh
hatchery will feel impact? Land
speculators are active all over the
state. Coastal wetlands and Chesa-
peake Bay are particularly endan-
gered.

CHEERS TO TRAVIS ROBERTS,
North Central Regional Director,
Fish and Wildlife Service, for cour-
age to close down snowmobile trails
on three national wildlife refuges,
based on observation that these
vehicles disturb wildlife and harm
wildlife habitat. His declaration that
public use on refuges must be sec-
ondary to primary responsibility for
protection and preservation Of wild-
life resources wholly commensurate
with President’s Executive Order of
February 8, 1972.

SOMETHING SMELLY ON THE
LONESOME PINE. Last spring Lone-
some Pine Enduro Association, a
motorcycle club, applied, for permis—
sion tO conduct a race through por-
tions of Cherokee National Forest
near Bristol, Tennessee. District
ranger turned thumbs down, with
complete support of Tennessee
Game and Fish Department. Never-
theless, he was overruled by forest
supervisor or regional Oﬂice. Mass
exercise Of 200 to 300 motorcycles
was run in Kettlefoot Management
Area—in direct conﬂict with spring
turkey season. In October, Lone-
some Pine Enduro returned with
proposed weekend event Of 400 en-
tries. Ranger George Anderson
nixed it because of possible conﬂict
with squirrel season—again was
overruled by higher—ups. First day’s
motorcycle action was staged in two
national forests, Cherokee and ad-
jacent Jefferson (in southwest Vir-
ginia). Second day shifted to
Hidden Valley and Clinch Moun-
tain state wildlife management
areas, despite refusal of Virginia
Game Division Chief Dick Cross,
Jr., to grant permission. These
lands, purchased with revenues paid
entirely by sportsmen through li-
cense fees and Pitman-Robinson
Federal funds, are fully owned by
Virginia Game Commission to sus-
tain annual crops Of wild game for
recreational use “by hunters, ﬁsher-
men and trappers.” Nevertheless,
Commission overruled management
experts and roar Of motorcycles was

Chimps win reprieve
from air bag tests

By ARMANI) GEBERT
News Staff Writer

; Thefate of two baby male chimpanzees at

TWayne State University is at stake in an argu-

m

;:;ment involving endangered species and auto
safety.

The animals were obtained recently by the

'4 college for experiments connected with auto

safety air bag studies

, But the Zoological Action Program (ZAP),
an international nonprofit organization dedi-

.;: cated to the conservation of endangered spec-
iies, has intervened 1n their behalf by appealing
ito the university to withhold any use of the
«chimps in the proposed auto safety tests.

A temporary stay of execution was granted

yesterday following a meeting between ZAP
representatives and the university’s Human
and Animal Investigation Committee.

George R. Campbell, local ZAP director, told
the committee yesterday that the use of the
animals in the scientific studies 15 a “useless
atrocity and waste to the species.’

He argued that cadavers or dummies could
be used in the tests instead .

He pleaded to have the animals donated to a
“responsible organization which would incor-

porate them into an effective breeding col-
ony.”

Dr. Lawrence Patrick of the College of Engi-
neering had informed the committee that dum-
mies and cadavers already have been used in
experiments but the problem now is the vul-
nerability of children.

Cadavers, he said, reveal skeletal, but not
organic damage.

He said chimps are the closest substitute in
body size and structure to children.

The prOgram seeks to determine if injury oc-1
curs when the air bag is inflated while the
animal is in various sitting, standing or kneel-
ing positions in a car.

Patrick said the animals would be under an-
esthetic when subjected to the tests.

Campbell said ZAP is supported in its pro-
test appeal by many organizations such as the
Detroit Audubon Society and the Animal Wel—
fare Institute.

The c'ommittee informed the ZAP represent-
atives their appeal would be taken under
advisement and that the tests would not be
held, pending a decision. No date has been set
for the decision.

ZAP spokesmen said they have not deter-
mined defintely What action they would take if
the decision should be unfavorable,

Cat populace
purrs easier

By JOAN BASTEL

Police Chief Merl Hesser gave
the City Council a lesson in
zoology Monday night.

There’s one big difference
between cats and dogs, he
explained. “You don’t see too
many dogs climbing trees, do
you?”

And for this reason, the chief
said, enforcing a cat ordinance
would not be very feasible.

A letter from a citizen, Arnold
Foulk, suggested that an or-
dinance be passed to control
cats running at large.

Chief Prepared

But the chief came to the
C o u n c i 1 meeting prepared,
toting copies of an excerpt from
a pamphlet, “Animals and their
Le gal Rights,” which is
published by the Animal
; Welfare Institute. The excerpt
3 pointed out the dangers to
felines when they were collared,
and the hardships experienced
in other communities where a
cat ordinance was tried.

Cats that would not be caught
would have to be shot, Hesser
said, and he didn’t think that
would be satisfactory to a
majority of the citizens.

He said the police department
”would need additional personnel
and at least $3,000 annually to
enforce such a law.

When the matter came to a
vote. the majority of the Council

agreed with Hesser, and the

motion failed.

Pollution Control
Councilmen gave the Board of
. Public Works the go-ahead to
pursue federal and state monies
for construction of a disinfection
chamber at the Water Pollution
Control Plant. After the sewer
water had gone through the
other processes at the plant, it
would be treated for about 15
minutes by gaseous chlorine in
a pool measuring approximately
10 by 30 feet, with a depth of
five feet. The chlorine treat-
ment would help eliminat
hazardous micro-organisms i
the effluent, which can car
' disease affecting people an.
river life.

' Dick Billingsley, manager of
the Board of Public Works,
' estimated the cost of the project
to be $20,000 to $25,000, with
an additional continuous ex-
pense for the chlorine. He said
the City/ of Beatrice was eligible
for 50 per cent federal par-
ticipation and 25 per cent par-
ticipation from the state.

Besides adding to the ef-
fectiveness of water pollution
control, Billingsley explained,
another project of the City’s,
the Indian Creek sewage in-
terceptor, hinges on the con-
struction of the disinfection
chamber.

He said the Environmental
Protection Agency is holding up
an application for federal and
' state participation in the in-
terceptor project until Beatrice
makes a move to disinfect its
effluent.

The interceptor, costing
- between $110,000 and $125,000,

. would be a main trunk line to

which other major lines would

be connected. It would be a
capital improvement, and only
those in the area who would
wish to connect their individual
lines directly to the interceptor
would be assessed.

No—Parking

On another matter, the
Council gave unanimous ap-
proval to the passage of an
amended ordinance relaxing the
nighttime no-parking
regulations. Now, cars parked
downtOwn between 2 and 5 am.
Will not be towed away. Cars
parked on the streets after a
snow emergency has been
declared. however. will still be
subject to tow-away.

An executive session to
discuss a candidate for the
newly-created position of city
recreation director led to no
action on the part of the
Council. Duaine Blaser,
chairman of the rec advisory
council, requested the Coun-
cilmen approve the hiring of
Edward L. Wagner of Council
Bluffs, Iowa. The salary asked
for by the advisory group was
$8,500. Councilman Harry Milke
moved for the secret meeting
of the Council to discuss some
questions he had concerning the
man’s application. The Coun-
Cilmen met behind closed doors
for 15 minutes.

Gentlemen:

Today it is possible, in a matter of minutes, to get your
press releases into the hands of media editors.

That is what Press Relations Wire in Washington was de-
signed to do and does through its closed circuit teletype
system to the major newsrooms of the Nation's Capital.

We are enclosing a brochure describing in some detail the
services which PRW offers you -— freedom from the drudgery of
grinding out copies of your releases and relying on unreliable

hand delivery.

In most instances, PRW teletype machines stand side—by-
side the machines of the wire services, enhancing the chances
that your release will receive close attention in the newsrooms.

In addition to our closed circuit, we have a supplemental
D.C. press release service whereby our own messengers will

Kirche und Tierweli
Von Oberstudienrat Dr. Josef O b e r, Religionsprof. i. R.

 

DIE WESENTLICHE BESTIMMUNG DES MEN-
schen in der Welt ist es, mit dem die Welt liebenden Gott
auch selbst zum Liebenden dieser von ihm geschaffenen
Welt zu werden. Das leuchtet doch wohl jedem glaubigen
Menschen auf den ersten Anhieb ein. Wir wolle‘n hier die
Welt allerdings nicht allein physikalisch verste'hen, son-
/ dern auch biologisch in ihren drei groﬁen Naturreichen
von Pflanze, Tier und Mensch — mit einem Wort: die
Welt in ihrer Ganzheit. Dieser Welt gehort also auch das
Wesen an, daﬁ dem Menschen an Seinsvollkommenheit
zweifellos am n'achsten steht: das Tier. An Vielen Stellen
der Bibel, besonders aber in den Weisheitsbiichern der
Hl. Schrift des Alten Bundes, klingt die liebende Sorge
des Schopfers um die Tiere auf. Es ist wirklich nicht ein
seinem Schopfungswerk gegeniiber irgendwie blofi kaltes,
zweckbedingtes Interesse, nein: es ist vielrnehr wahr'haft
Vaterliche Liebe jedem, selbst dem kleinsten und unschein-
barsten tierischen Wesen gegenﬁber. Der geistlose Rohling
freilich zertritt jede-n Wurm auf dem Boden mit sinn-
losem Haﬁ und mit der Freude am Leiden und am Tod
des Tieres. Ein Hl. Augustinus aber, der wohl groﬁte

Lockende Wildnis

Lehrer der Kirche, bewunderte Gott, den Schopfer — so
wird uns erziihlt — in stiller Beobachtung der zweckméiﬁi-
gen Bewegungen eines Wurms.

DIE VON UNS NACH GOTTES WILLEN ZU VER-
wirklichende Liebe zum Tier, fiihrt der Ordinarius fur
Moralthe-ologie in W’ien, Univ.—Prof. Dr. Karl Hormann,
in seinem ,,LeXikon der christlichen Moral“ (Tyrolia, 1968)
aus, dar1c nicht miﬁverstanden werden. Mit ihr vertragt
es sich sehr wohl, daﬁ der Mensch das Tier in seinen
Dienst nimmt. Die aus der Notwendigkeit ent3pr'ingende
natiirliche Uberzeugung, dalS unter den vorhandenen
Wesen die an Seinsfiille. unvollkommeneren fﬁr die voll-
kommeneren da sind, dafS etwa die Pflanzen den Tieren
zu ihrer Erhaltung dienen sollen und beide den Menschen,
bestatigt die Hl. Schrift: ,,Alles, was sich regt und lebt,
diene euch zur Nahrung“ (Gen. 9, 3). Ein Daseinssinn des
Tieres ist also der Dienst am Menschen, was ﬁbrigens
auch das letZte Konzil im Vatikan be-st'atigte. Aus dieser
Hinordnung ders Tieres auf den Menschen 1513: sich nicht
nur seine Verwendung, sondern auch seine Totung recht-
fertigen, wenn sie mit der wesentlichen Berstimmung des
Menschen in Einklang steht, d. h., wenn dadurch fur den
Menschen ein Nutzen erzielt oder ein Schaden verhiitet
wird oder wenn ﬁbermaﬂiges Leiden des Tie-res selbst ver—
hindert wird. Jesus tadelt z. B. an seinen Jiinger'n nicht,
daﬁ sie sich vom Fischfang n'ahr'en. Der Lie-be zum Tier
widerspricht aber sinnlose Totung; sie ist Siinde. Ebenso
steht Tierqu'alerei, d. h. Zufiigen von Schmerzen ohne
verniinftigen Grund im Widerspruch zu der dem Men-
schen aufgetragenen Liebe. Der Tierqualer versagt sittlich
nicht nur ‘gegeniiber dem Tier, sondern kann durch Betéi-
tigung der Gr'ausamkeit und Verhﬁrtung in ihr auch sei-
nen Mitmenschen zur Ge-fahr werden.

(Fortsetzung folgt)

Ein Film von Heinz Sielmann. —- Verleih: Constantin-Film

'WIEDER BESCHERT UNS HEINZ SIELMANN,
der Schopfer des Galapagos-Films, eines seiner unvergeﬁ-
lichen Filmwerke, mit denen er uns je-desmal ein Stuck
Natur in seiner ganzen Ursprﬁnglichkeit n'aher bringt.
Mehr noch — er zeigt uns, was ,,Natur“ eigentlich be-deu-
tet, denn: habe'n wir es in unserer technisch ausgerichteten
Welt nicht schon vergessen?

HEINZ SIELMANN SCHEUT WEDER MUHE
noch Strapazen. Mit unendlicher Geduld und unter har-
testen klimatischen Bedingungen belauscht er fast 2 Jahre
lang das Leben in einigen der riesigen Naturreservate
Amerikas. Ohne strengste, gesetzliche Regelung, die nicht
nur das Abschieﬁen der Tiere verhindert, sondern ihnen
auch ihren Lebensraum erhalt, h'atte die sich gef'ahrlich
vermehrende und ausbreitende Menschheit viele Tierarten
schon langst verdrangt. Unter sorgfaltigster Schonung
werden die Best'ande an Biiffeln, Robbe‘n und Kranichen
— um nur einige zu ne-nnen — wieder vermehrt und
z. B. Seeottern wieder an den Kiisten angesiedelt, von
denen sie bereits verschwunden waren. Hier hat der Welt-
Naturschutzbund (dem auch Usterreich angehort) in Zu-
sammenarbeit mit den einzelnen Regierungen beachtliche
’Erfolge errungen, und erfreulicherweise finden sich fiir
dieses Ziel auch die sonst weniger gut harmonierenden
Partner zusammen: Amerika, Ruﬁland und Japan, in
deren Hoheitsgebieten die Tiere der polaren Zone zu
Hause sind . . .

GANZ NAH FUHRT UNS HEINZ SIELMANNS
Kamera und die seines Assistenten Georg Theilacker an
die Tiere heran, jede Feder kann man auf dem Kopf des
briitenden ‘Reihers erkennen, jedes Barthaar der um die
Gattenwahl besorgten Pe‘lzrobben. Naturgetreu erklingen
auch die Stimmen der Tie-re: der Lockruf der Ginse, der
zornige Abwehrschrei eines Alligators, das Heulen de-r
hungrigen Prariewolfe. MilStrauisch schnauft der riesige
Grizzlybar, das gefahrlichste Tier der Rocky Mountains,
den Heinz Sielmann nicht ohne Angstgefiihl, aber wie
immer ohne jede Waffe beschleicht. Der Bar nascht dann
ganz harmlos an ein paar siifSen Beeren und grabt Wurzel-
werk aus den Erdhornchenlochern aus —- aber wer kann
das wissen? Wieviel eisige Nachte die beiden Manner wohl
im Freien verbracht haben, um die Balz der Prarievhiihner
einzufangen, die meist schon bei Tage-sanbruch eingestellt
wird? An einem besonders kalten Morgen endlich blie-sen
die Hahne ihre grofSen Kehls'acke noch bei Kamerahellig-
keit auf und wir werden Zeuge, wie sich die I-Ienne unter
fiinf Anw'artern den ihr zusagende-n Partner ausw'a'hlt.

DAS SIND NUR EINIGE DER' UNENDLICH VIE-
len, faszinierenden Szenen, mit denen Heinz Sielmann
uns das wunderbare Zusammenwirken aller Krafte in der
Natur vor Augen fiihrt. In dem knappen, Vo'llig unsenti-
rnentalen und nur auf biologischen, Erkenntnissen 'beru—
henden Kommentar erfahren wir zum Beispiel ﬁber die
Schnee-Eule, die sich hauptséichlich von Lemmingen n'ahrt,

2—

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

dafS sie in Jahren mit geringen Lemming-Bestanden ihr
Gelege von normal Vier Eiern auf zwei oder hochstens
drei Eierireduziert, in Lemming-reichen Jahren dagegen
bis zu zwo'lf Eier legt. Einige davon stiehlt ihr die listen—
reiche Raubmo've, fﬁr die somit auch gesorgt Wird ——

gibt es ein besseres Be-ispiel fﬁr die Notwendigkeit undi

den Segen der ,,Familienplanung“?

DIE TIERE DES HOHEN NORDENS LEBEN
meist in Herden und meist auf begrenztem Raum
—— das fﬁhr‘t zu Streitigkeiten urn den besten Platz
und zu Reibereien zwischen Rivalen. Hat aber ein
Kampfer die Uberlegenheit seines Widersachers erkannt,
Wird dieser durch eine ”Demutsgeb'arde“ und vorsich—
tiges Zurﬁckziehen besiinftigt. Fast immer werden
Kampfe innerhalb ein und derselben Tierart entweder
durch ererbte, instinktive Reaktionen vemieden, oder
der Aggre-ssionsbetrieb durch ledigliches Drohen ab-
reagiert. Raubbau am eigenen Korper, Gier ﬁber das Maﬁ
des Benotigten hinaus und Eingehen in ein Risiko, nur
um sich ﬁberlegen zu zeigen, gibt es in der den Natur-
gesetzen untergeordneten Tierwelt jedenfalls nicht, und
auch die Eisbarin, die ihre Jungen vor den Expeditions-
teilnehmern schﬁtzen Will, greift letzten Endes nicht an,
sondern bezieht die Defensive in einer gﬁnstigen Fels-
spalte.

HEINZ SIELMANN, DER SEINE REISE IM SUDEN
beginnt und uns die r‘iesigen, von den Zugvogeln zurﬁck—
gelegten Entfernungen zeigt, fﬁhr‘t uns-auch in die Winter-
quartiere dieser Vogelarten. Sie liegen zum Groﬁteil in
den Mangrovendschungeln der Everglades von Florida,
und Wie die zahllosen Seen und Tﬁmpel der Tundra im
Somme-r, so bilden jetzt diese feucht-warmen Sﬁmpfe eine
ideale Brutstatte fﬁr Stechmﬁcken aller Art — und damit
gibt es Nahrung im Uberfluﬁ fﬁr die Vogel. Faulende
Pflanzenreste fallen ins Wasser, dazu der Ko-t der Vogel
und hie und da ein Tierkadaver —— das alles néihrt das
Plankton, von dem die Fische und andere Wassertiere
lebe-n —, und nun kommen die Wasservogel zu ihrem
Recht. Ein jeder hat eine andere, fﬁr die betreffende
Vogelart spezialisierte Methode des Fischfanges und der
Nahrungssuche entwickelt: schieﬁt im Sturzflug von oben
auf die Beute, er‘zeugt mit den FﬁfSen Strudel im Wasser,
durch die seine Nahrung an die Oberfla'che geschleudert
wird, die Schnepfen stochern mit dem langen, gebogenen
Schnabel nach Schnecken und spiefSen den Fisch mit beiden
Schnabelenden auf, urn ihn dann in die Hohe zu werfen
und kunstvoll mit. dem geo'ffneten Schnabel aufzufangen
— ein ”Trick“, der von den jungen Vogeln, so scheint es,
zunachst mit Holzst'abchen geﬁbt Wird...

KLEIN UND‘ BESCHEIDEN MUSSTE DER
Mensch angesichts dieser unendlichen Vielfalt in der Natur
werden und staunend das \X/under schauen, durch das ,,ein
jedes Getier lebt und sich mehret auf seine Weise...“
In Wirklichkeit aber kﬁnnen zwar unsere Zwei— und Drei-
jlahrigen bereits mﬁhelos einen Mercedes von einem Volks-
wagen unterscheiden, ohne daﬁ man sie es gelehrt hatte,
aber selbst unsere Zwanzig- und Dreiﬁigjahrigen Wissen

ﬁber die Flora und Fauna unsere-r Erde herzlich wenig.
Vielleicht glauben sie sich ﬁber solches Wissen erhaben, da
doch der Mensch bereits den Mond erobert hat? Gewiﬁ,
die Mondlandung war eine groﬁartige Leistung, wurde
aber erst durch die genaue Kenntnis der Naturgesetze
moglich. Und eines ist allen Astronauten gemeinsam: das
Gefﬁhl des Verlorenseins in dem unendlichen Weltenraum
mit seinem feindseligen Schweigen, seiner eisigen Kﬁlte
Oder den todlichen, glﬁhenden Str‘ahlen . .. Nichts begrﬁﬁ—
ten die Beteiligten der beiden Mondumkreisungen mehr,
als das Wiedererscheinen der Erde am Horizont, von der
sie Wahrend ihrer Bahn ﬁber der erdabgewandten Seite
des Mondes durch 45 lange Minuten Vollig abgeschnitten
waren.

DER MENSCH IST EIN TEIL DER ERDE, ER IST
auf ihr und unter den Lebensbedingungen, die sie bietet,
durch die Jahrmilliarden zu seinem heutigen Selbst ge-
Wachsen. Das Zusammenwirken von Wasser, Luft und
Licht, vom gesamten Erdenleben l'auft mit der gleichen
Pr'azision ab, Wie die Keplerschen Kurven — und fﬁhrte
schlieﬁlich auch zur Entwicklung eines \Wesens mit geisti—
gen Fahigkeiten. Sollten Wir da nicht mehr Ehrfurcht
haben vor unserer Umwelt und versuchen, sie zu erhalten
anstatt sie sinnlos zu zerstoren? Sollten Wir nicht jedes
Lebewesen achten und ihm die Daseinsberechtigung zuer—
kennen, die Wir fﬁr uns selbst beanspruchen? Verpflichtet
unser Ursprung uns nicht zur Liebe zur Natur und zu
allem was lebt?

HEINZ SIELMANN VERMITTELT UNS DIESE
Erkenntnis in jedem Meter seines Films, er tut es unauf-
dringlich und Wie selbstverst'andlich, und Wir danken ihm,
dafS er die beglﬁckende Freude, die er bei seinen Erleb-
nissen empfunden haben mag, mit uns teilt.

Schildkrﬁie reﬂele Seemann vor Eririnken

Malmﬁ. —— Einen 153tﬁndigen Ritt ﬁber den Pazifik
ﬁberlebte ein- jun-gar S'ﬁdkoreaner auf dem Rﬁcken einer
riesigen Meereschildkrﬁte, dann wurde er von einem
schwedischen Frachter vor der Kﬁste Nikaraguas gesichtet
und an Bord genommen. Der junge Mann, der sich relativ

-3

rasch von den Strapazen erholte, berichtete, daﬁ er von
einem liberianischen Schiff ins Meer gefallen sei. Bei seinen
Rettungsversuchen hatte er dann die Schildkrote ent-
deckt, und es gelang ihm, sich 15 Stunden lang auf ihrem
Rﬁcken zu halten.

 

 




Ein Fisch, der Palmen ersieigen soll

Selbst Bﬁschungen werden von Kle-tterfischen ﬁberwunden. — Kletterfische verleugnen im Exotarium ihren Namen

DASS FISCHE GELEGENTLICH MIT DEM SPA- "

ten ,,gefischt“ werden konnen, hat im aufgeklarten Abe-nd—
lande erst sehr spat Glauben gefunden. Nicht nur Lungen—
fische verbringen n'amlich unwirtliche Trockenzeiten im
Erdreich vergraben in regloser Ruhe. Dadurch ist ihre
Atmung erheblich herabgesetzt und ebenso ihr Nahrungs—
bedarf, so daﬁ sie langere Zeit ohne je-gliche Kost ﬁber-
dauern ko'nnen. Auch indische Kletterfische beherrschen
diese Kunst. Sie suchen sich feuchte Stellen im tiefen
Schlamm, wenn die heiﬁe Tropensonne ihr Wohngewasser
austrocknet und die Erdkruste zu steinerner Harte erstar—
ren laﬁt.

KLETTERFISCHE ENTSPRECHEN IM AUSSEREN
durchaus unseren Erwartungen von einem durchschnittlich
ausgestatteten Flossentrager. In Wirklichkeit verfﬁgen sie
aber ﬁber ein zuséitzliches Atmungsorgan oberhalb ihrer
Kiemen, mit dem sie atmosph'arische Luft atmen konnen.
Ihre Flossen sind zum Teil im vorderen Teil mit beson-
deren Har'tstrahlen gestﬁtzt.

SO AUSGERUSTET, KUNNEN DIE TIERE NICHT
nur in stark verschmutzten Gewéissern le-ben, sondern
ﬁberdies bei genﬁgender Luftfeuchtigkeit, etwa W'ahrend
eines Regens oder am frﬁhen Morgen, weite Entfernungen
ﬁber trockenes Land wandern und selbst Steine oder im
Weg liegende alte Baumstamme auf Kiemendeckeln und
Flossen ﬁberklettern. Das freilich scheint fﬁr die Tiere
nur eine Notlosung zu sein, wenn ihr Wasserheim auszu-
trocknen droht und keine Moglichkeit fﬁr einen Ruhe-
schlaf im tiefen Schlamm bietet. Dahe-r verlangen die

Kletterfische im Exotarium von ihren Pflegern keine ﬁber-
triebene Sorgfalt beim Verschlieﬁen ihres Aquariums. Nur
bittere- Lebensnot veranlaﬂt die Tiere zu. Reisen ﬁber

Land.

FRUHE REISENDE WUSSTEN WAHRLICH ER-
staunliches ﬁber Kletterfische zu berichten. Als neun-
hundert Jahre vor der Zeitenwende der arabische Welten—
bummler Soliman Indien bereist hatte, erz'ahlte er seiner
unglaubig lauschenden Mitwelt von Fischen, die nachts
die Palmen erstiegen, um sich dort am Palmenwein zu
laben. Viele hundert Jahre spater tauchten die befrem—
denden Berichte erneut auf; weir mochte eine solche Unge—
heuerlichkeit schon glauben? Doch selbst von den Uber—
treibungen der alten Erzahler abgesehen, bleibt die Lei—
stung des Fisches, der nicht Viel groﬂer als ein Weinglas-
untersetzer Wird, ﬁberaus ungewohnlich. Nur ganz wenige
aus seiner engere-n Verwandtschaft haben es ihm nach—
getan.

KLETTERFISCHE GELTEN ALS AUSGESPRO-
Chen rauberisch und bissig. Selbst unter Geeschlechtspar‘t-
nern ist es mit der Vertraglichkeit nicht sehr gut bestellt.
Trotzdem sind die Fische in Indie-n nicht selten; wer zeit‘ig
morgens hinausge-ht, kann das Glﬁck haben, Wahre‘nd eines
Regengusses gle-ich ganze Trupps der Fischer auf Brust-—
flossen und Kiemendeckel gestﬁtZt von. einer Wasseran-
sammlung zur' anderen ziehen zu sehen. In Indien dienen
auch Kletterfische als Nahrung; fr'ﬁher wurden sie nicht
selten roh gegessen.

Zum Nachdenken

Ort der Handlung: Wien 19, Krottenbachstraﬂe,
Ecke Agnesgasse

Zeit: Sonntag, 1. Februar 1970

Es hat ein bchhen geschneit und nach Wochen sieht
man Wieder den blauen Himmel. Beglﬁckt wandern die
Familien ins Freie: Mﬁtter mit Kleinkindern an der Hand,
Véiter, Kinderwagen schiebend order SprofSlinge auf Rodeln
ziehend, einige grofSere Kinder mit geschulterten Skiern —-
und dazu natﬁrlich die Autos. Am Straﬁenrand geht ein
Weinhauerehepaar, hinter ihm, an der Kette —— zwe-i
Ziegen. Die frﬁhere Besitzerin hatte zu wenig Heu fﬁr
den langen Winter und konnte auch die Pflege nicht mehr
leisten. Nun werden die Tiere von Salmannsdorf in iHr
neue-s Heim nach Ober-Sievering gefﬁhrt — sie benehmen
sich ruhig und folgsam. Nicht so die Menschen. Alles
drangt sich um die Gruppe, auf das Betteln der Kinder
mﬁssen Vater ihre Autos anhalten, Rodelschlitten kommen
in Gefahr. ”Was ist das fﬁr ein Tier?“ hort man immer
Wieder und ,,Mutti, kommt da der Zirkus?“ schreit ein
Bub ganz laut.

Zugegebener'maﬁen, Ziegen in Wien, selbst in einem
Auﬁenbezirk, sieht man nicht jeden Tag. Aber sind unsere
Kinder Wirklich so arm, daﬁ sie sie nicht einmal kennen,
geschweige denn Wissen, daﬁ sie Milch geben und in der
Geschichte der Menschheit zu den 'altesten und genﬁg—
samsten Haustieren gehoren?

Vor nicht allzulanger Zeit wurde dem gleichen Ehe—
paar ein Ziegenbock — ein herrliches, kr'aftiges Tier —

4-

 




 

 

auf brutale Weise umgebracht. Rohlinge hatten ihm eine'n
Wurze'lstock tief in den Rachen gezw'angt, so dafS er
elendiglich ersticken muﬁte . . .

Glauben Sie nicht — und wir wenden uns hier haupt-
sachlich an unsere neuen Mitglieder — dafS Sie (lurch
freundschaftliches Einwirken auf Nachbarn und Freunde,
hauptsachlich aber auf die Jugend — Vie] Gutes fiir die
Tiere tun und die Ziele der Liga unterstiitze-n konnen?

(Es hande-lt sich in beide-n Fallen urn wahre Begeben—
heiten; die Frau des Weinhauers ist Mitglied der Liga und
uns personlich bekannt.)

Aluminium im Diensie des Tierschuizes

Von den Vereinigten Metallwerken Ranshofen e-rhal-
ten Wir e-ine Pressenotiz, die sicher fiir die Tierfreunde
von Interesse ist.

Es konnte die Erfahrung gemacht werden, daﬁ die
Verwendung von Aluminiumfolie auf Autobahnen ein
Wirksames Mittel ist, das Wild bei Dunkelheit zu warnen
bzw. es vom Uberqueren der Fahr'bahn im Moment des
mit eingeschalteten Scheinwerfern herannahenden Kraft—
fahrzeuge-s abzuschrecken. Auf den mit Aluminiumbiin-
dern bevgrenzten StrafSen kam es zu keinem Karambol
mehr zwischen Wild und Fahrzeug. Dadurch wird also
nicht nur Sachschaden verhindert, sondern vor allem das
Wild geschiitzt.

Wir hoffe-n, daﬁ auch die zust'andigen Stellevn dafiir

Interesse zeige-n und ﬁberall dort, wo mit Wildwechsel zu
rechnen ist, nicht nur Warntafeln fiir die Autofahrer an-

bringen, sondern die sicher Wirksamere Aluminiumfolie
zum Schutz von Mensch und Tier verwenden.

 

Nachruf auf eine Tierireundin

Wiener Arztin Frau DDr. Luise Jelinek, und ein
treues Mitglied unserer Liga. Sie brachte Tieren nicht
nur Liebe entgegen, sondern half ihnen, wo immer
sie konnte und unterstiitzte unsere Bestrebungen
nach besten Krﬁften, solange sie lebte.

Voriges Jahr ging sie fiir immer von uns. Damit
war ihre Fiirsorge fiir die Tiere aber keinesfalls zu
Ende. Frau DDr. Luise Jelinek hatte beizeiten vor-
gesorgt und ihr Wiener Haus den Tieren geschenkt,
indem sie es testamentarisch der Liga zum Nutzen
der Tiere vermachte. Wir werden treue Verwalter
ihres Vermachtnisses sein und in ihrem Sinne unsere
Bestrebungen zur Hilfe der leidenden Tiere fortset-
zen, unterstiitzt sowohl durch die finanzielle Hilfe
Wie auch durch das Vertrauen von Frau DDr. Luise
Jelinek, die sich mit dieser Tat ein unvergeﬁliches
Ande-nken geschaffen hat. Sie hat den Tod iiberwun-
den und wirkt fiir ihre ideale Aufgabe weiter, ob-
wohl sie nicht mehr unter uns weilt.

ES GIBT NICHTS EDLERES, ALS IN SEINEN
GUTEN TATEN WEITERZULEBEN!

Herr M. S. lehnt die Aufnahme von Versuchstieren ab,
we'il sie infolge des durchgemachten Schockes Walhrensd des Ver—
suches nicht mehr in e-in normales Le'ben Zurﬁckfin-den konnen,
sich mithin ihre Leiden nur verl'angern Wiir‘den.

Herr M. S. meint also nicht etwa korperlich kranke Tiere,
sondern korperlich gesunlde, die an e-inem psychischen Schock
leiden.

Herr M. S. ﬁbersie'ht, daﬁ kein Canide in de-r Lage sein
kann, zwischen etwa den langdauernden, schmerzhaften Ein-
griffen eines Tierar'ztes (etwa in einer Tierklinik, W0 das Tier
j-a auch vom Herren getrennt ist) in eigene-r Sache und einem
Versuch in Sachen Humanmed-izin zu unterscheiden. Das ist
doch wohl evident! Es Wurde ja eine Unterscheidung von Fak-
ten bedeuten, die dern Tier nicht bekannt sein konnen.

Herr M. S. miifSte also konsequenterweise wegen de-s mog—
lichen psychischen Schockes auch station'eire B‘ehan‘dlunge‘n in
Tierkliniken ablehnen.

Jeder Hundebesitzer Wird aber aus Erfahrung wissen, daB
Hunde solche Erlebnisse recht gut iiberstehen.

Damit sollen nicht die Lei-den der Versuchstiere bagatelli-
siert werden. Es soll nur be'to'nt werden, dafS keine irreparablen
psychischen Schadigungen entstehen (generalisierend gesprochen).

Hinge'gen wird jeder ehemalige Milit'airath Wissen: Je weni-
ger cortical ein Verwundeter gesteuert war (Ostvolker etwa),
je mehr wird er unter dern Eingriff von auﬁen (also bei der
Wun‘dversorgung) psychisch leiden, und zwar bei gleichzeitiger
— i. a.! — gro'ﬁerer effektiver Schmerzunempfindlichkeit, als
bei cortical Gesteuerten. Ich bin devr Meinung — ohne es
iibrigens anders als hypothetisch ausdriicken zu konnen — daﬁ
gleichsam schon der Anblick einer Verbandssche're zwis‘chen-
hirnlich gesteuerte Abwehrreaktionen in Erwartung einer ber-
Waltigung infolge \des Nichtiiberblickens der realen Situation
hervorruft. Hier liegt nach meinem Dafiirhalten das Qualende
cles Tiervcrsuche-s be-im hochstehenden Séiuger.

Da sich nun alber effektiv keine generaliszierende Assoziation
zwischen dern eingreifen‘den ExperimentatOr (oder analog dazu
dem beihandelnden Tierarzt eines stationar untergebrachten
Hundevs in einer Veterin'arklinik) und den ﬁbrige-n Menschen
bildet, scheinien mir die Bewdenken des Herrn M. S. iiberfliissig.

Hingegen scheint mir — abgesehen von der be-griiﬂens—
werten Iidee, Geschopfen, de‘nen es schlecht ging, elin besseres
Leben zu verschaffen — der psychologische Vorteil fﬁr die
Gattung Mensch vo-n groﬁter Beldeutung.

Und zwar sowohl aus invdividual-psychologischen als auch
allgemein-psychologischen Griinden. '

Zu 1. individual—psychologische Grunde:

Sozial Intakte leiden im Hinbl-ick auf die allgemein bekann-
ten Grausamke‘iten (Viet-Nam, Biafra, Negerpro-blem, Vivise-k—
tion usw.) an der Unmoglichkeit, die aufgestaute'n Verteri‘di-
gungstrieube und dem Drang, helfen zu konnezn, zu re'alis-ieren.
Durch Aufnahme eines ehemaligen Versuchstieres ergibt sich
e'ine Moglichkezit der Trievb—Entstauung. Blei W'irklich sozial
Hochstehenden wohl die einzige Mo'glichkeit, ein echtes Therla-
peutikum zu erreichen. Hier Wird dem Menschen, de'r gleich-
sam stellvertretevnd an einem Tier Entsetzliches gutmacht und
gutmacheln kann (w'ahrend ihm sonst die Hande ge'bundevn
sinld!) wohl noch mehr selbst geholfen.

Zu 2. allgemein—psychologische Griinde:

Das naturwissenschaftliche ,,Gespiir“ dringt in immer wei-
tere Kreise. Damit die Einstellung, die ganz im Sinne der
realen Fakten den Menschen nicht mehr als ,,anderes“ Wesen
als das Tie-r sieht, sondern nur als eine Spezies unter vi-elen.
Etwa als tool-making—animal.

Hier nun ergezben sich zwei mogliche Einstellungen:

a) ,,Der Mensch ist auch nur ein Vieh“, wer also die Macht
hat, kann andere Artgenossen genau wie andere Gattungen
zu Versuchen miﬁbrauchzen. In nachSter N'ahe s'tlehen dann
die Experimente in KZ’s und die Totung ,,nicht-lebens—
werten“ menschlichen Lebens. Was days fiir erine Gefahr fur
die Menschen bedeuten kann (und gerade fur Hochwertige,

 

 

 




 

 

die s-ich zu ideologischen Stellungnahmen verfﬁhren lassen,
dann von machtigeren Gegnern als ,,Untermenschen“ ge—
stempelt und entsprechend miﬂbraucht werde-n), wissen wir
aus dem Kleinexpe‘riment des Dritten Reiches. Man braucht
nur hinzuldenken, daﬁ nunmehr die Machtblo'cke global sind,
um sich vorstellen zu ko'nnen, wohin eine solche Mensch—
heit steuert.

b) ”Genau Wie der Mensch, leidet auch das Tier und miissen
Wir zugeben, daﬁ wir ihm Schmerzen verursachen, wenn
Wir an ihm experimentieren.“ Nimmt man ohne Selbst—
heuchelei das aus dieser Einstellung resultierende ‘Schuld-
ge-fiihl auf sich, bringt seinen Opfern Mitgefiihl und Ach—
tung entgegen, versucht man, ihnen dann zum Ausgleich
weni'gstens ein gutes Leiben zu bieten, so blockiert man
die unter a) beschriesbene Ge-fahr, dient mithin der eigenen
Spezies. Nun sage man mir nicht, ein paar Leute, die
Versuchshunde aufnerhme‘n, hatten keiine Wirkung. Erste'ns
hat jede Tat Vorbildwirkung, mithin einen Aktionsraidius.
Zweitens kann man am Anf-ang einer Aktion nie den Erfolg
voraussehen. Er hangt von der Geschicklichkeit der Agie-
renuden und Vielen unvoraussehbaren Umstanden ab. Unrd
wer ha'tte das Recht, sich anzumaﬁen, eine ethisch hoch—
wertige Tat (also eine, die dem Fortbestand der eigene'n
Art «dient, ihrer Nichtgefahrdung durch AbStumpfung us-W.)
als voln vornherein zum Scheitern verurteilt, nicht zu be—
ginnen? Man lese unseren letzten grofSen Humanisten, ich
meine Albert Camus. Man lese ihn nicht nur, sondern ver-
suche, ihm nachzuleiben.

In exiner Zeit, in der Entfernungen praktisch keine Rolle

trop-ische UrW'alder besuchen und ein Land in einem 3-Tage-
Programm ”absolvieren“, stellt unis Gunther Nietzke eein Stiick
Natur gewissermafSen mitten ins Wohnzimmer, und Wir haben
nun MufSe zu schauen und Zu staunen. Das Halten von Terra-
rientiereln ist ein noch relativ wenig verbreitetess Hobby —
Viele von uns schrecken bei dem Gedanken an Schlangen und
Krotevn mit Abscheu zuriick oider haben iiberhaupt recht vage
Vorstellungen von Schwanzlurchen Oder Kriechtieren. Damit

r'durnt Gunther Nietzke griin‘dlich auf. In dies-em Buch bleibt
ke’ine, aber a‘uch gar keine Frage offen. Es schilldert uns die

Entwicklungsigeschichte der Amphirbien und Reptilien durch die
Jahrmillionen und zesigt, Wie sie sich nach dem Prinzip der
Auislese den jew-eiligen klimatischen Bedingungen und Natur—
ge'gebenheiitesn anpaﬁten. Nun versvtehen Wir, warum die Schil-d—
krote soviel Sonne (older S-onnenersatz!) braucht und fiir den
Alpensalamander ein gewisser Fe-uchtigkeitsgrad notwendig ist.
Bezeichnungen Wie ,,kopfbe-rgende Schildkro'te“ o'devr ,,Gelb-

ungewollt W'ahr'schesinlich, werden wir mit Staunen erfﬁllt Vor
dioser Leaistung der Wissenschaft, die in endloser Kleinarbeit
all die Kenntnisse zusammengetragen hat, die uns nun zur

Wesensanalyse fﬁr Junghunde
Von Prof. Dr. J. B 0 din g b a u e r, Wien
Im Selbstverlag Wien. S 110.—.

Em. Hochschulprofessor Dr. med. vet. Joseph Bodingbauer
hat in einem sehr ansprechenden, kurz gefaﬁten Buch ﬁber die
,,Wezsensanalyse fﬁr Junghunde“ geschr‘ieben.

Darin ist in einzelnen Kapziteln zusammengefafSt seine 30‘j'ah-
rige Er'fahr‘ung, die er sowohl mit der Aufzucht als auch Ab—
richtung von Junghunden gesammelt hat. Es ist seltven ein B-uch
in so kormprimierter Form abgefaﬁt worden, das allels wesent-
liche in pragnanten S'atzen enthalt und veranschaulicht, Wie
Junghun/de auf ihre Charaktereigenschaften untersucht werden
sollen und welche Rﬁckschlﬁsse daraus zu zie-h-en sind.

Dies'es Buch g'ibt etinen exakten Hinweis darfauf, ob sich ein
Junghund fﬁr die Abrichtung ﬁberhaupt ezignet und we‘lche
Merkmale erforderlich sinid, um eine gezielte Abr'ichtung er-
folgreich Zu ge'stalten.

Dieses Buch mﬁBte man nicht nur allen'Abrichtern un-d
Hundefﬁhre-rn in die Hand (drﬁcken, damit s-ie ihrle Ar‘beit
erfolgreich gestalten konnen, sondern auch alle Tier'arzte und
Zuchtverbandsleziter mﬁfSten, da sie ja ﬁber diese D'inge Aus-
kunft geben mﬁssen, rdieisess Buch le'se'n und sich an diesse Richt-
linien halten.

. Diese Anle‘itungen sind so exakt und durch Beispiele fun—
diert, dafS slie wohl kaum ‘durch anrdere Abhandlungen ersetzt
werden konnen.

' Es ist zu hoffezn, daﬁ diesels. Buch sowohl bei allen Hunde—
liebhabern, als auch Fachrberatern ﬁber die Abrichtung Eingang
finden Wird.

Hans Lohrl bringt uns in seinem Buch ,,Tiere und Wir“
20’ Tiergeschichten. Es sind Naturerlebnisse, die uns der Ver—
fasser in diesen Geschichten vermittelt. Erlebnisse unid Beo-b-
achtungen, die er mit evinheimischen und auch mit exotischen
Tieren aus Nordamerika und aus dem unwegsamen Afghanistan
gemacht hat. Er schil-dert nicht nur lehrreich, sondern auch sehr
unterhaltsam; seline Verhaltensforschunge-n ze-igen uns, dafS
Wir vie-1e unserer Ansichten ﬁber die Fre-iheitsliebe, Dankbar—
keit etc., sowie das Verhalten in der Freiheit und der Gefan-
genschaft, das Zusammenleben mit Artgenossen oder mit anvde-
ren Arten, grundlegend andern mﬁssen.

Der Verfasser vermittelt uns in seinevm Buch eine Reihe
von Erkenntnissen aus seiner T'atigkeiit als Verhaltensforscher,
die vovn praktischem Wert fﬁr den taglichen Umgang mit Tieren
sind. '

Ausgestattet mit 38 Bildern, die von dem Verfasser selbst

Der Mensch schuf sich den Affen //

Von R. und D. Morris
Verlag BLV, Mﬁnchen—Basel—Wien. S 146.50.

Wie relagiert der Mensch, der unvermittelt sein Ebenbild
— allerdings in einem grotesk verzerrenden Spie-gel — erblickt?
Ein E-benbild, das sich ungeniert kratzt, Grimassen schneidet
und die ,,Krone der Schopfung“ gerade‘zu hoffungslos lach'e'rlich
macht? Negiert er die Ahnlichkeit, hafSt er dieses Wesen, lie-b1:
er es, verehrt er es, lacht er es aus o-der versucht e-r die Zu—
sammenhange objektiv und Wissenschaftlich zu erforschen?

Ramona und Desmond Morris haibein alle diese Fragern in
di-evsem ihrem zweite'n Affenbuch eingehend untersucht und
schiladern sowohl die Be'ziehung ,,Affe — Mensch“ bei den ver-
schiedenen Volkern im Wandel der Jtahrhunderte, als auch die
rein naturwisseneschaftlichen Aspekte einer seit Darwin nicht
mehr weigzuleugne'nden Entwicklungsreihe.

Das Buch ist hochinteressant und dabei lebendig, leicht ver-
standlich un‘d unterhaltend geschrieben und mit zahlreichen
Illustrationen ausgestattet. In ‘seinem Bestreben, mit dem Pha-
nomen der Ahnlichkeit fertig zu werden, schuf sich der
Mensch — im wahrsten Sinne — den Affen. Im alten Indien
machte er ihn zum Gegenstand kultischer Verehrung, in Afrika
verfolgten ihn Neger Wie einen feindlichen Stamm un‘d auf
Sumatra wurde er mit der Beutegier eines Kopfj'algers bekampft.
Brereits im Alt'ertum versuchte man ihn voller WissensdurSt
zu s‘ezieren, erdiachte sich dann aber im Verlaufe der Geschichte
ein menschen'ahnliches Fabelwesen, das nur in Zeichnungen und
Beschreibungen existierte und ﬁber Ida‘s die Wildesten Gerﬁchte
im Umlauf waren. Erst mit den ersten leben-d nach Europa
gerbrachten Affen zerfirel dieses Bilid unsd wurde abgelost vom
Spaﬁmacher, vom Zirkusclown, vom nicht mehr wegzuldenken—
den Begleriter deis Drehorgelmannes, von der in zoologischen
Garten bestaunten Karikatur des Menschen. Bis die neuzeitliche
Wisxsenschaft sich seiner bemachtigte und in ihm das ,,Tier“
erforschte: seine Lebensweise, se-in soziales Verrhalten, seine
Intelligenz unid — letztere sofort zu ihrem Vorteil auswer-
tete.

Heute ist der Affe als Versuchzstier (er lief'ert u. a. den
Impfstoff gegen die Kinderlahmung) von unschatzbarem Wert,

unld unsere Mitcglieder, denen Wir das Buch Warmstens eimpfe'h-

viel hoherein Warte behandelt, als wir ers in 'O'sterr'esich ko‘n-
nen, W0 Wir uns ja an die Probleme unseres Landes halten
mﬁssen. R. und D. Morris erz'zihlen, Wie die amerikanischen
Tierschutzvereine, an erster Stelle Mrs. Christine Stevens (udie
auch m-it unserer Ligia in engem, personlichem Kontakt steht)
und das von ihr geleitete Animal Welfare Institute, den Affezn
als Versuchstier prinzipiell akzeptieren, sich aber scharfstens
gegen d-ie Art des Einfangens untd de‘s Versanrds wendete-n unrd
Liar. schon beachtliche Erfolge erzielen konnte'n. Auch Amerika
V'ertritt — Wie Wir — den Stan‘dpunkt, daﬁ im Idealfalle die
Versuchstiere in ~der Versuchsanzstalt selbst zu ziicht-en sind, um
das Problem de-s Eingewohnens und de's Transportes auszu-
schalten un.d um die Bestande zu schonen —- letzteres jetdenfalls
so lanege als der Men/sch die Tiere nicht aus ihre‘m natiirlichen
Lebensraum verdrangt. Und der Kreci-s schlieﬁt sich: die geeig-
neten Mittel zur Eindammung de-r Bevolkerungsexplosio-n kon-
nen nur am Affen als dem menschen'ahnlichsten Tier auspr‘o-
biert werden — 'zu unserem und zu seinem Wolhle.

Man fangt zu lesen an, fiihlt sich so r-ichtig behaglich dabei,
schmunzelt, lachelt, denkt: ,,Das War’ e-in Leben!“ Ja, das denkt
man, wenn man von den Kapriolen der z’artlichen, angriffigen
kleine‘n Eselin Annabel lie-st. Un-d von den Kapriolen der Ehe-
leute Doreen und Charles Tov-ey auf dem Rucken ihrer Pferde
(unid nicht nur dort), von den Kaprio-len Salomos unld Shebas,
des weltberiihmten Siam-Katzenpaares. Im Vordergrunvd immer
wieder die Frage: Beko-mmt Annabel ihr-en Julius? Julius, den
Sohn aus ihrer Hochzeit mit Peter? Julius schon im vorhinein
genannt, weil die Geburt im Juli erwartet Wird. Doch von
Julius keine Rede. So hofft man auf Augustus, dann auf Sep-
timus, bis man die Hoffnung auf Annabels ,,gute Ho'ffnung“
schlieﬁlich fahren 158:.

Dazwischen sorgen Katzengeschicht-en, Reitlektionen, die
lioben Nachbarn, allerlei Tiere, Kinder, Erwachsene, das ganze
Dorf fiir turbulente Abwechslung.

Ein Buch fiir jung und alt (nicht nur fur Tierliebhaber!),
fiir alle, die Vergnﬁgen an einem vergniiglichen Buch haben.

Was alless Platz hat in erinem so zierlich—hiibzschen und
gar nicht teuren Buch! Die Bil‘der — Meisteraufnahmen ders
Photokina-Preistragers Dirk Schwager: da Wirbeln diese ur—
Wiichsigen Pfer'de daher, einzeln, in ganze-n Herde-n und —-
haben auf der Stelle unser Herz erobert. Dazu der kurzweilige
Text der groﬁen Pferrde-Kennerin Ursula Bruns —— alle's grunrd—
legend Wiss-enswerte ist darin evnthalten. .

Ponys: Relitpfendchen fur die Kleinen? Zirkusrosse? Hier
Wir'd man schnell evines Besseren belehrt! Was man international
als Pony beizeichnet, sollte richter ,,Rosbustpferd“ heiﬁen. D'as
simd keine Spielp-ferde. Die schottischen Highlands und Shet-
lands, die Huzulen, Panjes, Dartmoors, die Connemaras aus
Irlanud — um nur einige zu nennen —, das sind noch Ur'zeit—
p-ferde: stark umd wach, geisunid und unbekiimmert. Sie sorgen
fiir sicb se‘lb'st, bediirfen keiner minutiiisen Pfle-g-e. Anspruchs-
losigkelit, Ausdauer, Gutmiitigkeit s'ian ihre Charakterzeichen;
kraftvoll-stammig die Korper: D'as sind ideale Reitpferrde,
gerade fiir uns-ere herutigen Verh'altnisse.

Und deshalb ist ,,Urwiichsige Ponys“ ein so ideales Ge-

BLUEBIRD AUDUBON swim or MISSOURI p. 9 August, 1970

~ 6m“: 0/: 77¢; Mun, Uwrza/

Do you like to get out and hunt for rare birds? Do you keep lists on your
trips, and around your hometown, and for state, or big day lists? In short, is
birding a sport with you, complete with the thrill of the chase and the trophy list?
Then the AMERICAN BIRDING ASSOCIATION is for you. The A.B.A. concerns itself
with the hObby and sport of birding. Birding tips, locations, and general news
of interest to birdirs is included in the bulletin “Birding" put out by the AJB.A.
Eventually it is hoped that a register of birders oan.be set up to show visitors
around. This is a new growing organization with lots of exciting ideas beginning
to grow.

Dave Easterla has been appo.nted to the first board of directors and as
such felt that birders in his own state should be notified of this new group. Already
Missouri ranks third in membership i;n the U.S. Other officers in the AJB.A. are:

President.........G. Stuart Keith, New York
Vice-President....Arnold Small, CalifOrnia
Sec-Treas.........James Z. Tucker, Texas

Directors-at-Large ...Marjorie Adams, Texas Bill Harrison,.Arizona
Charles T. Clark, Illinois Guy'McCaskie, California
Olga Clarke, California Robert Smart, New Hampshire

David Easterla, Missouri
As you may recognize by the officers, this organization has some really tOp
birders in its ranks. It also has a lot of potential. Anyone interested in joining
should contact: James Tucker, P.0. Box #335, Austin, Texas, 78751

MORE 0N‘RUFOUS...Just a note that while the Rufous Hummer had been next door to Jim Haw's

congratulated Westinghouse for this year holding a Science Talent Search.exhibition that
contained the work of forty finalists, none of whose projects caused pain or suffering

to vertebrate animals. Ernest Roscoe, ecologist at Chicago reported to the ANI, "The

‘ Gamma IN NATIONAL PARKS
--Robert Doerr , Missouri Nature Conservancy

The pressing problem of gross overcrowding in the national parks, monuments,
recreation areas, much to the destruction of the natural values, is demanding ever-

increasing attention.

Suggestions heard most frequently are for quota systems for

visitation to, and use of, such.areas, and controls on equipment brought into the

areas 0

vast program of land acquisition so as to dilute usage.

President Nixon in his State of the Union message mentioned the need for a
Perhaps all three are needed.

For example, those most innocuous pieces of equipment, the canoe and binoculars
(with people), are so numerous on the Ozark National Scenic Riverways that degradation
is substantial in key spots and only a quota approach seems practical. A quota system

implies a schedule of reservations.
One proposal was that users park at the unit boundary and bike in, with their camp

gear hauled in on government trucks.

Will it Work?

It seems that many areas are too

tough for'biking, and, just as on the airlines, baggage handlers would be too rough
Instead, perhaps, a prohibition against private wheels and motors

would be more appropriate.

and then ride in the same vehicle to his lodging or campsite.
for sightseeing of a sort, and also transport hikers to and from trailheads, to stores,

amphitheatres, museums, etc.
about park features to leave their cars wo

The visitor could load and unload his own gear on the truck,
Busses could provide

No one would be excluded, but many who don't care enough
uld choose not to contribute to the overcrowding.

.Another worthwhile idea on crowding these parks comes from the American Society

of.Architects;

they suggest making (and remaking) our cities attractive enough that

they need not be escaped from for decent recreational opportunities.

itions in its field, the 65-year-old
Audubon Society has from its
earliest days been concerned
with a broad. range of c-onServa-
tion activities and has never!
deserved the more. limited “bird

In recent years the Society’s
interests have grown even

 

broader, says president Elvis,‘

J. Stahr.

'lbday’s environmental prob-
lems, Stahr added, have led
,National Audubon into such ac-
‘tivities as distributing BAN
gDDT bumper stickers, fighting
a huge jetport that would have
led to the destruction of Ever-
glades National park, suing a

charging pollutants into a wild-
life refuge, urging the public to.
buy low-phosphate detergents‘
and soft drinks that come in
returnable bottles—even warn-
ing that no conservation pro-
gram can succeed unless popu-
lation growth is somehow
curbed. .
Such programs, Dr. Stahr

I said, have apparently appealed

to the growing number of Ameri-
cans who are asking: “What
can I do to help save the envir-
omnent?”

Much of the Society’s work is'
done at the local level. There,|
too, the figures are shooting
upward. There is now an all-!

MORE ABOUT THAT EAGLE NEST

After we reported last issue that Transportation Secretary Volpe had
agreed to move a highway in Florida to save an eagle's nest, we learned
that the full story was somewhat less inspiring.

It turns out that the nest has been inactive for at least seven years,
and has been so reported by the nearby Manatee Audubon Society, of

The nest is in a tree on the property of a Bradenton City
Commissioner, and the shift in the route means now the highway won't
cut through the commissioner's land.

The 100,000 membersz figure
is actually a minimal one. If
the number of adults in each
“family membership” is count-
ed as two the total comes to
more than 136,000. .

An equally large number of
persons—bringing the total to
well above a quarter of a million
.-—are reached indirectly through
formal affiliation with some 250
garden clubs and other local and
state groups whose member-
ships help support the Auddbon
,cause; hundreds of thousands
more are reached each year
through the Society’s film lec-
tures, nature centers, educa-
tional programs and related
aCtivities.

Volume 4 of IUCN’s Red Data Book series,
for freshwater ﬁshes, has just been issued,

Black Mark to H.M.G.

If Britain’s chances of entering the Common
Market were to depend in any way on the
British Government’s enthusiasm for taking
part in European Conservation Year 1970,
we should be a non-starter. Faced with one
practical, if minor, opportunity of

demonstrating its Europeanness, the Govern-

ment has scored almost negative marks.
There is effectively no ofﬁcial national
effort to celebrate ECY 1970 in Britain, for
a willingness to act as a co-ordinating centre
for voluntary efforts is parasitism rather
than participation. The blame rests
squarely on HM. Treasury, the champion
miser when it comes to good causes, but
also on the ofﬁcial bodies, especially the
new Countryside Commission, who should
have been rooting more strongly to be
enabled to play an effective part in the
Year. The National Environment Research
Council has now so completely dominated
the Nature Conservancy, that it must be
blamed for preventing the Conservancy
from playing the progressive and construct-
ive part it has done, for instance, in the
Countryside in 1970 movement. Of course,
the Conservancy then trod on a number of
ofﬁcial faineant toes, and the owners of
the toes are now treading back. But to
satisfy the amour-propre of a small group
of civil servants and politicians, the whole
people of Britain must suffer a loss.

Britain leads Europe, and in some ways
even the world, in many aspects of nature

2

and conservation, and the people of Britain
should be allowed to learn about this in
1970, as all the other European countries
will about their own efforts.

ECY Gap

England is lagging behind Wales, Scotland,
Northern Ireland and the rest of Europe in
arrangements for European Conservation
Year 1970, writes Peter Conder in the
July Birds. So far no steering committee
has been set up to promote and make
national arrangements for ECY. Since the
Scottish Committee has been set up by the
Countryside Commission (Scotland), the
ball would seem to be squarely in the
court of the Countryside Commission for
England and Wales

Dangers in Pets

The dangerous whims of the general public
in creating a demand for exotic pets were
referred to at the International Veterinary
Congress held in London in March. These
often lead to the capture of excessive
numbers of animals, many of which die
during transit. A particularly bad example
is the trade in wild tortoises, the vast
majority of which fail to survive their first
winter in captivity. The demand for pet
monkeys is another undesirable trend, since
recently imported monkeys may carry
disease. The recent lifting of the ban on
importing parrots by the British Ministry
of Agriculture was against veterinary advice,
and there have since been massive import-
ations of carriers of human psittacosis.
(British Birds, May). No fewer than 100
Cheetahs are now being kept as pets in West
Germany, 80 of them in the city of
Hamburg, where they have become tne
latest status symbol.

Salmon Fishing Ban Proposed
By eleven votes to two (Denmark, West
Germany), the members of the International

Commission for Northwest Atlantic Fisheries,

meeting in Warsaw in June, supported a
proposal by Canada that high-seas salmon
ﬁshing should be prohibited within the
Convention area. If this proposal is agreed
to by Governments, it will have the effect

3

and is obtainable either from IUCN

(1110 Morges, Vaud, Switzerland) for

US 8 6 or 25 Swiss francs, or from the
Fauna Preservation Society (0/0 the Zoo,
Regent’s Park, London, N.W.1) for £2 4s).
The compiler is Dr R.R. Miller (U.S.A.)
and 78 endangered ﬁshes are included.

THE ENVIRONMENT

Defoliation in Vietnam

According to Professor E.W. Pfeiffer of
the University of Montana, more than
2,700,000 acres in Vietnam were sprayed

with defoliants in 1967 and 1968, and more
than 300,000 acres of crops were destroyed.

It is estimated that over, 20 per cent of the
total forested area of Vietnam has been
defoliated at least once. Two applications
of spray on a mature hardwood forest in
Vietnam kills about half the commercially
valuable timber, and in the mangrove areas
of the Rung Sat peninsula there is an almost
total kill. The destruction of trees naturally
has a profound effect on the ecology of

the area, and many former forests are being
invaded by grass and bamboo, which will
prevent the re-establishment of forest.

Environmental Council

President Nixon has created a cabinet-
level Environmental Quality Council to
direct and coordinate federal policies, with
himself in the chair. Immediate priority
will be given to the problems of DDT,

will also be a Citizen’s Advisory Committee

Crosland for Pollution

As part of the British Government
reshufﬂe in early October, Anthony
Crosland, Secretary of State for Local
Government and Regional Planning, has
been given the responsibility of making
an urgent investigation into the pollution
of the environment throughout Great
Britain, and to recommend any necessary
changes in the law or machinery of govern-
ment.

Sweden Bans Dieldrin

As from 1 January, 1970, all use of aldrin
and dieldrin is forbidden in Sweden,
together with the use of DDT in household
and home-garden preparations. Other uses
of DDT are prohibited for a trial period of
two years. Hungary is the only other
country with a complete ban on organo-
chlorines, and Russia has in fact never
permitted the use of aldrin and dieldrin.
(IUCN Bulletin, April).

Norway has followed Denmark and Sweden
in banning the use of DDT, aldrin and
dieldrin as from October 1970.

(Daily Telegraph, June)

Ban DDT in U.S. Call

The National Audubon Society has
launched an all-out national campaign to
ban DDT. Michigan has already banned
DDT, and California has done so for

home and garden use as from January 1970.

Sunset magazine in California has said it
will no longer accept advertisements for
products containing DDT and ﬁve other
hard pesticides. Conservationists have
thwarted a plan by the Army to cover
2300 acres at Kelly Air Force Base near

4

 

San Antonio, Texas, with 69,000 lb of a
dieldrin compound, to ward off a possible
invasion of insect or other pests in cargo
from Vietnam.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has
ordered both the Forest Service and the
Agricultural Research Service to stop using
DDT, dieldrin, endrin, aldrin, chlordane,
toxaphene, heptachlor and BHC pending
a review of the Department’s pest control
programmes.

Michigan Wins Award

Michigan Department of Natural Resources
and its Director, Dr Ralph A. MacMullan,
have won the 1969 Annual Outdoor Life
Conservation Award. They have been
chosen for their successful restoration of
sport ﬁsheries in Lake Michigan and for a
successful two-year battle to end pesticide
pollution in the Lake Michigan watershed.
Michigan has recently banned DDT.
(Outdoor News Bulletin, June).

DDT and Sparrow Hawks

Experiments with the sparrow hawk or
American kestrel at the Patuxent Research
Station of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
has shown that birds given a diet rich in
DDT or dieldrin manifested the following
symptons: increased egg disappearance,
increased egg destruction by parent birds,
and reduced eggshell thickness. Thus still
further light is shed on the mechanism by
which the organochlorines have devastated
the populations of many species of birds of
prey in both Europe and North America.
(R.D. Porter and SN. Wiemeyer, Science,
v01. 165,1969) '

More DDT Effects

Experiments at the Montana Cooperative
Wildlife Research Unit suggest that two of
the effects of sublethal doses of DDT are

to make it more difﬁcult for young
predators to learn how to obtain their food,

and to make it more difficult for prey spec-
ies to avoid being killed by predators.
(Outdoor News Bulletin, June).

Swallow Catastrophe

Disaster overtook many European swallows
wintering in South Africa last November,
when many thousands were picked up dead
or dying in north-east Zululand. It is
thought that an unseasonable cold spell
greatly reduced the amount of food
available, so that the birds had to draw on
their fat, thus bringing the DDT and other
pesticide residues up to lethal level. The
DDT content of some carcases analysed
averaged 70 parts per million.
(Lammergeyer, June).

Dispersol Disperses Oil

Imperial Chemical Industries claims to

have produced a new substance, Dispersol,
which disperses spilt oil as very ﬁne droplets
in sea water, is harmless to marine organisms
and is cheap enough to compete with
conventional detergents. Development

tests are being carried out by three govern-
ment departments.

BRITISH ISLES

Farmers and Naturalists

The ﬁrst-ever working conference of farmers
and naturalists to discuss mutual problems
met at the National College of Agricultural
Engineering, Silsoe, Beds, in July. On the
ﬁrst day separate syndicates of farmers

and naturalists walked a 400—acre farm in
Hertfordshire and prepared detailed plans
which were discussed by the conference on
the second day. The aim was to accommo-
date conservation interests without undue
prejudice to the proper agricultural use of
land under modern economic conditions.
The conference was organised jointly by the

5

Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds, the British Trust for Ornithology,
the National Farmers’ Union, the Society
for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, the
Nature Conservancy and the Ministry of
Agriculture.

 

Ospreys in Scotland

Five pairs of ospreys either nested or
attempted to nest in Scotland in 1968. The
Loch Garten pair, visited by 37,500 people,
reared two young. The second Speyside
pair failed to rear any young for the sixth
year running, breaking one egg and failing
to hatch the other, which was fertile. At the
third Scottish site, ﬁrst used in 1967 , three
young were reared, one of which was
recovered in Spain in December. A fourth
pair built a nest nearby but did not lay,
and elsewhere in Scotland a ﬁfth eyrie was
also found, but without eggs.

(Scottish Birds, Summer).

In 1969 four pairs of ospreys are known to
have bred, and at least 20 other ospreys
were reported in various parts of Scotland.
Three pairs produced two young each, but
the eggs of the fourth pair failed to hatch.

 




  

The snowy owls bred for the third year
running on Fetlar, Shetland. Including
young from former years, at least 15 snowy
owls are now present in Shetland, and it is
hoped that some more may breed in 1970.

Bountiful Bounties

The Northern Ireland Government has
been paying bounties on foxes since 1943,
and in recent years the total paid for never
seems to have dropped below 70000 a year.
Since a check of snares set for foxes in
Wales showed that 1440 settings accounted
for eleven badgers, four foxes and a dog, it
seems likely that this bounty system has
resulted in the destruction of many animals,
both domestic and wild, besides foxes. The
one thing the scheme does not seem to have
brought about is the reduction of the fox
population. Instead a steady income is
provided for a few people with a special
skill in catching foxes, and a casual bonus
for a large number who chance to kill a fox.
Might the NI. Government not spend its
money more effectively?

Mink in Ireland

North American mink Mustela visorz,
escaped from fur farms, have now been
reported from eleven counties in Ireland,
ﬁve of them in Northern Ireland, which
waited until January 1968 to prohibit the
keeping of mink without a licence. Family
parties have been seen in Tyrone, on the
Strule, Mourne and Glenelly Rivers, and it
seems only a matter of time before the
whole island is colonised.

(Irish Naturalists ’ Journal, July).

Exotic Pheasants in Dorset

Six pairs of Elliot’s pheasants Syrmalicus
ellioti have been released on Furzey Island
in Poole Harbourby the Ornamental
Pheasant Trust. It is hoped that they will
establish themselves as successfully as the
Swinhoe’s pheasants Lophura swinhoei
have done on neighbouring Brownsea

6

Island, where at least two pairs are known
to have nested successfully in 1968.
Although two pairs of blue-eared pheasants
Crossoptilon auritum also nested on
Brownsea last year, they failed to rear any
young.

Sea Eagles at Fair Isle

The three young white-tailed or sea eagles
from Norway, which were released last year
on Fair Isle, Shetland, where they have long
been extinct, came successfully through

the winter, and are now regularly seen.
They have learned to fend for themselves,
and food is no longer left out for them.
(Birds, July).

Two British Firsts

Two North American birds were recorded
for the ﬁrst time in the British Isles in
March: an evening grosbeak at St Kilda on
the 26th and a ring-billed gull at Gairloch,
Wester Ross, on the 30th.

(British Birds, May).

Geese and the Airport

The construction of the third London
Airport at Foulness, Essex would mean
the loss of the winter feeding grounds of
one-ﬁfth (6,000) of the total world
population of the dark-bellied brent goose,
conservationists told the Roskill Commiss-
ion’s F oulness Inquiry in July. Moreover
the 180,000 gulls which roost there every
autumn evening would create great air-strike
problems.

(Birds, July).

London's Wildlife ‘

A pair of kestrels has successfully reared. a
brood of four in a window box on the 16th
ﬂoor of a block of ﬂats near the Old Kent
Road.

Deer Parks in England
There are now just over 100 deer parks in

England covering a little more than 30,000
acres. In 1892 there were 395 such parks,
with a total enclosed area of nearly 150,000
acres, but by 1949 the number had fallen
to 143. There are very few deer parks left
in either Wales or Scotland, but well over a
dozen in Ireland.

(Deer, June).

Zoos in Britain

At the beginning of the 1969 season 82
zoological collections were open to the
public in Britain, and 22 more were being
planned, of which it was expected that
three would be opened in 1969 and perhaps
another eight in 1970.

(Annual Report, Federation of Zoos of
GB. & I)

Salop Nature Trail

The ﬁrst nature reserve in Shropshire, across
the Shropshire Conservation Trusts’ Earl’s
Hill reserve at Pontesford, was ofﬁcially
opened on August 2 by Christopher Cadbury,
President of the Society for the Promotion
of Nature Reserves.

First Stereo Recordings

The ﬁrst serious attempts to start a collect-
ion of sterophonically recorded bird sounds
has been launched in Somerset by

Jeffrey Boswall and Peter Copeland. Tests
on robins and tawny owls in February were
most encouraging. Wildlife recordists
interested in this work should write to
Jeffrey Boswell at Birdswell, Wraxall,
Bristol BS19 1JZ.

Another Merger in View

The Game Research Association and the
Eley Game Advisory Station are jointly
exploring the possibility of merging their
activities in a new independent organisation
to be based as at present at Fordingbridge,
Hants. The Station has recently opened a
Game Centre at its headquarters.

EUROPE

Saving Birds of Prey

A new method of saving rare and decreas-
ing birds of prey, which usually lay two
eggs but rear only one young, has been
pioneered with lesser spotted eagles
Aquila pomarina in eastern Slovakia. The
newly hatched second young birds were
removed from two eyries, and reared in
black kites’ nests, from which the young
kites were removed to a third kites’ nest.
One young eagle was returned to its original
eyrie just before it could ﬂy, and left the
nest along with its elder, but the other
developed too fast and ﬂew before it
could be returned “home”. It is suggested
that this method could be used with other
large birds of prey, such as the golden
eagle and the 1ammergeyer.

(Berliner Naturschutzblatter, December).

Eagle Owls in Germany

Detennined efforts are being made by the
Deutscher Naturschutzring to re-establish
the eagle owl as a breeding bird in parts of
northern and western Germany where it is
rapidly decreasing or has become extinct.
Releases of wild caught birds were found to
be ineffective, because the old birds were
killed by road or rail trafﬁc while defending
carrion prey and the young ones wandered
away. Renewed attempts are now being
made with young aviary-bred stock, with
the assistance of the Ornamental Pheasant
Trust.

Slovak Bears Saved

In 1932, when it was ﬁrst protected, the
brown bear was almost extinct in
Czechoslovakia, only about 20 surviving.
Today there are some 300-330 in northern
and central Slovakia, and allegations of
damage to livestock have resulted in
permission for a few to be shot each year,
for “hard currency” , the number not

 




 

exceeding 5 per cent of the total
population.
(Ochrana Fauny, 1969, no. 3)

Wolves in the Landes

Wolves have reappeared in the Landes in
south-west France this year for the ﬁrst
time for many years. French conservation-
ists fear the time is not yet ripe to propose
that they should stay there, farmers being
compensated for any damage they may do,
so the World Wildlife Fund has suggested
that they should be caught and removed to
a nature reserve.

(Courrier de la Nature, April).

Whoopers in Finland

Protection of the whooper swan, on both
its breeding and wintering grounds is begin-
ing to pay off. The number of breeding
pairs in southern Finland has increased
from 21 in 1964 to 30 in 1968.

Threat to La Vanoise

French conservationists are protesting
vigorously at the decision of the conserv-
ators of France’s ﬁrst national park, la
Vanoise, founded only six years ago, to
sacriﬁce an important part of the park to a
vast tourism development project. They
feel that this is hardly the way for France to
celebrate ECY 1970.

National Birds
The azure-winged magpie has been chosen
as the National Bird of Portugal. The
bird’s scientiﬁc name has also been chosen
as the title of the new journal of the Port-
ugese ornithological journal, Cyanopica.
The first issue appeared at the end of 1968.
The white wagtail has been chosen as the
National Bird of the Latvian SSR, and the
peregrine as the National Bird of Czecho-
Slovakia.

NORTH AMERICA

Harp Seal Harvest

The total number of harp seals taken by
Canadian and Norwegian sealers from the
Gulf and Front herds off eastern Canada
and Newfoundland in 1969 is estimated at
253,000, compared with 190,000 in 1968
and 331,000 in 1967. The scientists advis-
ing the Seal Panel of the International
Commission for Northwest Atlantic F ish-
eries (meeting in Poland in June) recomm-
ended that no more than 175,000 pups a
year should be harvested if the stocks were
to be maintained at their present level. This
is 60,000 less than the actual number taken
in 1969. To prevent disturbance of the
whelping patches, and to ensure the con-
tinuance of an adequate stock of female
seals, it is also recommended that sealing
be conﬁned to the period between

7 March and 25 April..

Caribou Increase in Canada

An aerial survey by Donald C. Thomas has
estimated the number of caribou in north:
ern Canada at some 325,000, according to
a Canadian Wildlife Service Report. This
appears to represent a substantial increase
since the last censuses in the late 1950’s,
when 200,000 to 277,000 were estimated.
As recently as 1949, however, there were
670,000, and in 1937 there were believed
to be three million. It is gratifying that the
numbers of this important natural resource
appear at last to have taken an upward
turn.

Blast that Refuge!

Widespread fears were expressed among
conservationists at the possible impact on
the wildlife of the Amchitka Wildlife

Refuge in the Aleutians of the underground
nuclear explosion planned the re in October
by the Atomic Energy Commission. Further
fears were expressed that the blast might

9

touch off earthquakes in various parts of
the North Paciﬁc. At the time of writing
(early November) no earthquakes have been
reported, but it may be too soon to assess
the impact on the wildlife.

Airport Site Rejected

The preservation of natural values was a
key factor in the rejection by Minnesota’s
Metropolitan Council of plans to site a
major airport for Minneapolis and St Paul
next to the Carlos Avery Wildlife Manage-
ment Area. Siting the airport there would
have disrupted the recharge area for ground
waters, lowered water tables, degraded the
wildlife area by altering existing water
relations, and brought low-ﬂying aircraft
into close proximity to ﬂocks of birds,
with obvious safety risks.

Prizes for Torture in US Schools

“There is a growing fad among high school

students to perform heart transplants,
brain surgery and other radical experiments
on animals . . . High School students are
not usually skilled enough to perform
these difﬁcult operations. They frequently
end by torturing the helpless monkey or
bird or rabbit or inadvertently sending it

to a slow, lingering death . . . High School
science teachers and national organizations
can bring this unhealthy fad under control
by refusing encouragement and prizes for
bizarre and inappropriate biological
projects.”

Vandalism at Baltimore
Animals in Baltimore, Maryland, Zoo are

being killed by a wave of vandalism. Three

sea-lions were killed by a massive dose of
pesticide, a tiger was recently given a dose
of barbiturate which would have killed a

When Fox Bites Fox

lemmings are the chief prey of arctic foxes,
according to ‘ The Dynamics of Canadian
arctic fox populations”, a Canadian Wildlife
Service report by AH. Macpherson. In
years when lemmings are scarce fewer
whelps survive. Conﬁdent statements that
man is the only animal to kill his own kind
seem to be controverted by the ﬁnding
that ﬁghting among the whelps is an
important factor in reducing the number of
whelps which survive from each litter.

Animal Barter

LATIN AMERICA

Mountain Tapir in Danger

The Swiss zoologist Paul Schauenberg,

who has carried out missions for the World
Wildlife Fund in Ecuador, conﬁrms that
the mountain tapir, Tapirus pinchaque of
the Andes is in danger of extinction if the
present drain on its population to supply
zoos is not checked. It survives only in
Colombia and Ecuador, to the number of

a few hundred, and certainly not more than

I 2000. The mountain tapir should be

greatly helped by the recent institution of
the national park of Cayapas in Ecuador.
The American Association of Zoological
Parks and Aquariums has placed a ban on
the acquisition of the mountain tapir by
its members until the end of the year,
pending the investigation of its status in
the Andes.

New Export Bans

Five Latin American countries (Brazil,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Peru)
are repOrted to be imposing restrictions on
the export of certain animals. From Peru,
for instance, the export of a few rare
animals will be prohibited, while others
will require a licence. Fresh restrictions on
animal exports are expected in several
African countries as a result of their
signature of the new African Wildlife
Convention. In Thailand certain rare
species may now only be exported through
the Bangkok Zoo.

White Rhino Statistics

In 1968 the number of white rhinos in

the Hlulhuwe-Corridor—Umfolozi complex
in Natal stood at 1020, compared with
567 in 1959. During the eight months to
31 January, 1969, 34 more white rhinos
were translocated from these overcrowded
reserves to Angola, Swaziland and other
parts of South Africa, bringing the total
number moved so far to 516.
(Lammergeyer no. 10).

The South African National Appeal of the
World Wildlife Fund has made a grant of
R.5,000 to the National Parks Board of
South Africa to cover the transport expenses
of 40 more surplus white rhinos from
Natal to the Kruger National Park. It will
also grant-aid the translocation of 56 white
rhinos from the Umfolozi reserve in
Zululand, to the Gorongosa National Park
in Mozambique.

ASIA

Jungle Fowl Ban .

To support the Government of India,
which has banned the export of the feathers
of the endangered grey jungle fowl Gallus
sonnerati, the United States Government
has acted under the Lacey Act to ban the
import of these feathers into the United
States. The feathers are in great demand
by salmon and trout ﬁshermen, and there
has been widespread evasion of the quota
originally ﬁxed. The British Section of the
International Council for Bird Preservation
has for several years been trying to persuade
the Board of Trade to take similar action,
and the Board has now withdrawn the
existing quota arrangements for the annual
import to Britain of 4,250 grey jungle fowl
skins. (IUCN Bulletin, April).

BOOKS IN BRIEF

The Domestication and Exploitation of

' Plants and Animals, edited by Peter J. Ucko

and G.W. Dimbleby (Duckworth, £735),
is the proceedings of a research seminar at
the Institute of Archaeology, London
University, and is the most important
contribution to the subject since Zeuner’s
great work. It occupies the hitherto ill-
explored borderland where biology meets
both archaeology and anthropology, and

‘ ranges from the origin of agriculture to

the exploitation of molluscs and the use of
the onager as a draught animal. Among
the biologists contributing are J .G. Hawkes,

C.D. Darlington, Peter Jewell and R]. Berry.

Kangaroos, by H]. F rith and J .H. Calaby
(Hurst, £6. 65.) is a comprehensive review
of the biology of these large marsupials,

which admirably summarises our present

knowledge. In an important final chapter
the authors tackle the tangled question of
conservation. There is in fact no conserv-

ation policy for kangaroos (and precious

little for anything else) in Australia, and
the plight of the red kangaroo, in serious
danger of extinction if uncontrolled crop-
ping continues much longer, high-lights
that of the whole group.

Andalusian Flowers and Countryside, by a
distinguished plantsman, Lt. Cdr. C. M.
Stocken, who died tragically in an accident
in Greenland in 1966, is now published by
his widow (Mariners, Thurlestone, Kings-
bridge, S Devon (163 post free or $2.50 for
soft cover, 285 p.f. or S4 for hard cover).
It covers Gibraltar and Morocco as well as
Andalusia, with—a ﬁne array of photographs
including some colour, and will slip very
handily into the pocket of any botanist or
ﬂower lover visiting that delectable part of
the world.

Biology and Ethics, edited by F.J. Ebling
(Academic Press, 40s), the proceedings of

a symposium of the Institute of Biology, is
a valuable examination of the biological
background to human ethics, including the
problems raised by developments in genetics
and an important discussion on biological
warfare. Among the biologists taking part
were J .R. Busvine, F. Fraser Darling,

N.W. Moore, A.S. Parkes and J .W.S. Pringle.

Though he does not go to quite such lengths
as Len Howard does with birds in making
his house available to badgers, Phil Drabble
has much of the same spirit in him in his
Badgers at my Window (Pelham, 308).

There are many fascinating sidelights on

the behaviour of both tame and wild
badgers in the book.

Animal Partnerships, by Maurice Burton
(Warne, £1), is a most interesting survey of
the various types of relationship between
different species of animal, broadly kndwn
as symbiosis: commensalism, parasitism,
inquilinism and mutualism. The author
ranges over the whole animal kingdom,
from lions to sponges, for his examples.

The Trees of Bicton, by N.D.G. James
(Blackwell, 30s) lists the specimen trees in
the well known Devon arboretum, with
some most interesting historical notes.

 




  

  

Modern labour troubles seem to have had

Growing Points for 1969

At the outset of the present
decade, at the new year of 1960,
the British press indulged in the
most extraordinary outburst of
euphoria, which was quickly
dampened as the decade ad-
vanced. We may hope therefore
that the current deluge of gloom
will prove equally unrealistic.
While there is plenty that is
wrong in the conservation world,
as readers of KINGFISHER are all
too often reminded, there is also
much that is right, and moving
in the right direction, that gets
all too little publicity. The inde-
pendent governments of East
Africa, for instance, have been
much more willing to recognise
and promote the importance of
their wildlife resources than the
colonial administrations they re-
placed. The Department of the
Interior in the U.S. and the
Nature Conservancy in Britain
both lead the world in certain
aspects of conservation, and the
men who put them in the lead,
Stewart Udall and Max Nichol-
son, are still working with us
even in their ‘retirement’.

2

There is, too, encouraging pro-
gress in the protection of some
seriously endangered species. The
united efforts of the Indonesian
Government, IUCN’s Survival
Service Commission and others
seem to have put a stop, for the
time being at least, to the lethal
trade in orang-utans. Positive
action is also being taken to deal
with the varied threats to the
Arabian oryx, the Javan rhino,
the nene goose and the blue and
humpback whales, among others.
BOth the Nature Conservancy in
the United States and the county
naturalists’ trusts in Britain are
vigorously tackling the problem
of saving speciﬁc areas of land as
reservoirs for wildlife. More-
over, it is fair to say that thanks
to the efforts of a very Wide spec-
trum of conservationists, in
which the sterling efforts of the
World Wildlife Fund and the
continued excellence of Oiyx
have both played a large part,
there is now a greater and more
widespread public awareness
both of the dangers facing wild-
life and of the cultural im-
portance of combating those
dangers.

Threat to Albert N.P.

Since November 1967 an ex-
tremely grave threat to the Parc
National Albert in the Congo
has developed as a result of a
massive invasion of the park by
tribesmen from across the
Rwanda border, according to
Kai Curry-Lindahl in the IUCN
Bulletin for October. As a result
the greater part of the park has

been ravaged by an army of
hunters equipped with a varied
assortment of weapons ranging
from guns and traps to spears
and bows and arrows, who roam
the entire area without hin-
drance. A large-scale trade has
developed in poached meat and
Other wildlife products. On the
Semliki River, for instance,
some 5,000 hippo are believed
to have been killed. The situa-
tion is especially grave in the
mountain gorilla sanctuary in
the Virunga Volcanoes, where
several thousand Rwanda peas-
ants with their cattle have moved
in and destroyied a large part of
the limited habitat suitable to the
gorillas. Partly as a result of this,
and partly by direct killing, it is
estimated that three-quarters of
the gorillas in the sanctuary have
perished. In short, almost the
entire park and its facilities are
facing total disintegration unless
quick and decisive action is taken
by the Congolese Government.
[It is understood that some
action has already been taken.—

Ed]

Dingell Bill Delayed

The Dingell Bill to protect en-
dangered Wildlife, which had
passed through all its stages in
the House of Representatives,
failed to clear the Senate in time
to become law before the end of
the 90th Congress. It is hoped it
will have a better chance in the
9lst.

Introduced Species Policy
IUCN has issued a policy state-

ment on introduced animal and
plant species, arising out of the
discussions on the subject at its
Lucerne meeting in 1966. This
calls for steps to minimise acci-
dental introductions, severely
restrict introductions of any kind
into national parks and nature
reserves, and to allow the intro-
duction of species into new
habitats only after the most care-
ful and comprehensive assess-
ment of the likely consequences.
The statement is given in full in
the IUCN Bulletin for October.

For Fishery Scientists

The International Academy of
Fishery Scientists, founded at
Rome in July, 1967, is now open
to membership. The Academy is
dedicated to the recognition of
those ‘who devote their profes-
sional lives to the advancement
of ﬁsheries for the beneﬁt of
mankind’. Applications for mem-
bership should be sent to the
Executive Secretary, L. P. D. Ger-
tenbach, Dept. of Fisheries,
FAO, Rome, Italy. There is an
initial membership fee, but no
annual dues.

A Change of Name?

At the 1968 general assembly of
the International Youth Federa-
tion for the Study and Conserva-
tion of Nature, held in Finland,
it was agreed to change the name
of the IYF to the International
Youth Federation for Environ-
mental Studies and Conservation.
The proposal now has to be rati-
ﬁed by the member societies.

Deﬁnition

A conservationist is not blindly
opposed to progress, but is
opposed to blind progress. (Nat-
ional Wildlife, October).

 

Pollution News

 

A Deadly Remedy

The use of detergents to counter-
act oil pollution in shallow or
conﬁned waters is a cure worse

4

 

than the disease itself, pointed
out the House of Commons Select
Committee on Science and Tech-
nology in its report on coastal
pollution published in August.
The Plymouth Marine Labora-
tory had established that the
absence of young ﬁsh south of
the Seven Stones between Corn-
wall and Scilly a month after the
wreck of the Torrey Canyon in
March 1967 was the result of
spraying detergent against the
escaping oil, for ﬁsh eggs and
young ﬁsh tend to float near the
surface. Detergents, moreover,
do nOt destroy oil but merely dis-
perse it, and enable it to penetrate
the gills of ﬁsh and the digestive
systems of ﬁlter-feeding organ-
isms. The Committee rebutted
the view that ‘the question of
marine life doesn’t really affect
the holiday industry’, pointing
out that to many people one of
the delights of visiting the sea-
side is to study and enjoy the
wide variety of marine fauna and
flora.

After Torrey Canyon

The few stretches of Cornish
coast which were affected by
Torrey Canyon oil but not
treated by detergents now show
no signs at all of their once
heavy pollution. The last residues
of the oil were either eroded
away by the storms of winter
1967-68 or grazed off by the
large numbers of limpets and
other gastropods which were not
seriously affected by the oil itself.
On the treated sections of the
shore, limpets are still largely

absent, and as a result there is a
substantial growth of the brown
seaweeds on which they feed.
Winkles, however, are gradually
returning, and there has been a
large deposition of the larvae of
the acorn barnacle. (Neiwlelier,
Cornwall Naturalists’ Trust,
September).

Pesticides in Ruminants

The rate of pesticide removal
from ruminants can be more
than doubled by feeding them
with charcoal, reports a team of
dairy scientists at Michigan State
University. Routine feeding of

charcoal to cows will probably

prevent milk ever being taken
off the market on account of con-
tamination with organochlorine
residues, the legal tolerance for
which in the United States is
at present zero. (BioScienee,
August).

Dieldrin in the Soil

Scientists at Wisconsin Univer-
sity have identiﬁed six chemicals
produced by bacteria as they de-
grade dieldrin in the soil. One is
aldrin, an equally deadly pesti-
cide, but the other ﬁve are not
known to exist in nature, and it
is important that their toxic
properties should be ascertained
as soon as possible. One of the

‘ new compounds appears to be a

terminal breakdown residue, or
the ﬁnal outcome of the use of
dieldrin in the environment,
which may accumulate in the soil
indeﬁnitely. (Tloe Timer, Septem-
ber 3).

Pesticides in Sweden

Since mercury compounds have
been banned in Sweden, seed-
eating birds such as yellowham-
mers and ortolans have returned
to areas from which they had dis-
appeared, Kai Curry-Lindahl
told the Ninth Conference of the
European Continental Section of
the International Council for
Bird Preservation in Hungary in
May. Birds of prey and owls,
however, do nOt yet show any
signs of recovery.

New Jersey Pollution Ban

For the ﬁrst time on record a
group of New Jersey communi-
ties have been ordered to halt
major construction programmes
in the interests of keeping the
state’s rivers clean. Nine com-
munities have been ordered by
the State Superior Court to sus-
pend any further building until
they stop polluting the Rock-
away River. (Mam. Audubon
N ewileiier, October).

No DDT in the Parks

The use of DDT has been
banned in the national parks
of Canada, to avoid serious
damage to ﬁsh and wildlife popu-
lations. (British Columbia Wild-
life Review, September).

Weedkiller Banned

The agricultural chemical herbi-
cide picloram is to be banned in
Great Britain because it persists
and steadily accumulates in the
soil. It has been widely used for
clearing scrub.

 




 

Spain Bans Detergents

As from January 1, 1969, the
Spanish Government has banned
the import, export, production
and distribution of household
and industrial detergents which
do n0t conform to stringent stan-
dards of biodegradability. This
strong action to protect the en-
vironment from permanent pol-
lution takes into account the
highly successful German law
which lays down a minimum
biodegradability of 80 per cent.
(1 U CN Bulletin, October).

 

British Isles

 

New Look at Nature Reserves
The time has come, writes Dr
Duncan Poore in the latest report
on the Nature Conservancy’s
progress, for 1964-68, to stop
thinking of ‘nature reserves’ and
‘the rest’, and instead to plan a
graded series of degrees of con-
servation, from are-as which are
managed exclusively as nature
reserves at one end to areas
which are devoted exclusively to
other uses. In between these ex-
tremes there may be combina-
tions of uses, some nature re-
serves, for instance, being used
also for public recreation, educa-
tion or limited agriculture, while
some farms, forests and reser-
voirs are partly set aside for wild-
life. Although such secondary
uses may slightly detract from
the efﬁciency of the primary use,

6

only by such concessions can
the needs of everybody in this
small and overcrowded country
be met, and the lasting values of
our countryside be preserved.
What has happened in the past
incidentally and almost by acci-
dent, through balanced land and
estate management, must more
and more in the future be done
deliberately and of intent.

Welsh Countryside Unit

At the invitation of the Country-
side Commission the Field
Studies Council has established
a Countryside Unit in Pembroke-
shire, of which John Barrett,
Warden of the Dale Fort Field
Centre, has been made Director.
The new unit is a contribution
towards the Commission’s educa-
tional and information services,
and will, for instance, prepare
guides and itineraries to the
wildlife, geology, antiquities, and
Other aspects of the Pembroke-
shire coast and countryside. The
Pembrokeshire coastal footpath
will be annotated in much the
same way as has already been
done for the Dale peninsula.
Field excursions and evening lec-
tures will be organised. The
Unit’s temporary address is An-
chor Cottage, Dale, Haverford-
west, Pembs.

Bird Ringing Report

Once more the British bird ring-
ing scheme notched up new
records in 1967, with a total
of 574,529 birds ringed. The
swallow and sand martin headed
the list with totals of 49,581 and

48,581 respectively, followed by
the blackbird (58,557), blue tit
(29,017),house sparrow (28,976),
greenﬁnch (28,856) and starling
(26,085). Recoveries during the
year included the ﬁrst Whooper
swan from the Faeroes, Bewick’s
swan from Latvia, curlew-sand-
piper from the USSR, and san-
derling from Ghana. (Brim/.2
Birds, November).

Rabies Safeguards

In reply to a parliamentary ques-
tion from Marcus Kimball, M.P.,
the Minister of Agriculture
stated that he was considering
the possibility of extending the
quarantine regulations to include
species Other than canines and
felines which might introduce
rabies into Britain. A report
from the United States Public
Health Service has shown that
skunks, foxes, bats, raccoons,
bobcats, mongooses, squirrels,
opossums, coyotes, woo-dchucks,
mice, groundhogs, wolves, rats,
guinea pigs, ﬁshers, ringtail cats
and mink are all carriers of
rabies, which is currently spread-
ing in Europe.

The Otter in Cornwall

Ten years ago the otter was still
plentiful in Cornwall, but today
it is very much scarcer. The total
Otter population of the county is
certainly under 200 and most
probably. only about 120, of
which the great majority fre-
quent the coast. At the former
headquarters of the species on
the Lizard numbers are now
greatly reduced, but how far this

is due to oil pollution from the
Torrey Cam/0n it is impossible
to say. (Bulletin, Cornwall Nat-
uralists’ Trust, September).

Reservoir for Dartmoor

The Meldon valley on north-
western Dartmoor is to have a
reservoir after all. The Minister
of Housing and Local Govern-
ment has ruled in favour of the
North Devon Water Board after
a six-year ﬁght between the
Board, the Dartmoor National
Park Committee and the Dart-
moor Preservation Society, who
say that one of the wildest and
most beautiful valleys on the
moor has now been lost.

Salmon in Britain

The annual commercial catch of
salmon in Britain is 520 tons,
according to the October Newl-
lelter of the British Ichthyo-
logical Society. The sea trout
catch is 155 tons.

Wiltshire Schools and the M.4
The ecological impact of the M.4
motorway across Wiltshire—
described as the greatest event
in the county since the coming of
the Great Western Railway—is
being studied by teams of chil-
dren from Wiltshire schools.
Stretches of road that will be-
come disused will be surveyed,
as well as habitats that will be
profoundly inﬂuenced by the
construction work. Geological
and civil engineering aspects of
the construction work will also
be studied. (Countryside in 1970,

Exotic Pheasants in Dorset

At least two pairs of the Swin-
hoe’s pheasants released by the
Ornamental Pheasant Trust on
the National Trust’s Brownsea
Island in Poole Harbour, Dorset,
nested successfully last year, and
the t0tal number of birds on the
island is now 19. In addition
two pairs of blue-eared pheasants
nested, but none of their young
survived. Six pairs of Elliot’s
pheasants have now been re-
leased on the neighbouring Fur-
zey Island.

Bluethroat in Sc0tland

More details are now available
about the ﬁrst nesting of the
bluethroat in Britain (vol. 4,
no. 2, p. 6). The nest was found
by four ornithologists somewhere
in the Moray Basin faunal area
of Sc0tland on June 13, and con-
tained four eggs. Unfortunately
only the hen bird was ever seen
so it was n0t possible to deter-
mine if the cock was of the red-
spotted or white-spotted race.
The eggs failed to hatch, and
were probably eaten by a small
mammal. (Britta/9 Bim’J‘, Novem-

ber).

Linnean Society Appeal

The Linnean Society of London,
premier natural history society
of the British Isles, has issued an
appeal for £55,000 to provide
adequate protection for the
priceless collections of the great
Swedish naturalist Linnaeus,
which the Society bought from
Sir J. E. Smith’s executors after
his death in 1828. It is intended

8

to build a ﬁreproof and water-
proof room for them in the base-
ment of the Society’s rooms in
Burlington House. In addition,
it is planned to modernise the
Society’s accommodation and
library at Burlington House, and
prepare a new and comprehen-
sive catalogue for the Library.
Donations may be sent to the
Honorary Treasurer, the Earl of
Cranbrook, Linnean Society of
London, Burlington House, Pic-
cadilly, London W1. Covenants
would be especially appreciated.

Wildfowl Trust Develops

The Wildfowl Trust is shortly to
launch a Development Cam-
paign, appealing for £320,000 to
expand and develop its educa-
tion and research work, its propa-
gation of rare species, and its
Wildfowl refuges at We-lney and
elsewhere, among Other objects.

M.Sc. Conservation Course
Overseas students are being en-
couraged to apply for the one-
year postgraduate course in con-
servation at University College,
London, which is now an M.Sc.
in Conservation. Inquiries for

Registrar, University College
London, Gower Street, London
W.C.1. Some advanced course
studentships are available from
the Natural Environment Re-
search Council.

Europe

 

International Duck Count
Thousands of ornithologists and
wildfowlers throughout Europe,
western Africa and southern Asia,
from Norway and Nigeria to
Assam and East Pakistan, enu-
merated hundreds of thousands
of ducks in a midwinter census
in January 1967. The most num-
erous duck was the mallard, with
just over a million, followed by
364,000 wigeon, 290,000 tufted
duck, 200,000 common pochard
and 171,000 teal. The rarest duck
enumerated in the area was
Steller’s eider, with only 30, all
in Norway, followed by the
velvet sc0ter, with 1,078. (IWRB
Newsletter, nos. 23/24).

EUREL

The European Association of
Free Nature Reserves—EUREL
—has now acquired an ofﬁcial
status in Belgium, where its
statute has been approved by
royal decree. EUREL works in
close association with the World
Wildlife Fund and has as its
main aim the establishment of
nature reserves by agreement
with landowners, a technique
which has already been widely
exploited by the county natura-
lists’ trusts in Britain. EUREL is

also especially interested in the
protection of birds of prey. Its
President is E. KestelOOt of Bel-
gium, and its Secretary, Martin
Bijleveld of the Netherlands;
other ofﬁcers and board mem-
bers hail from France, Spain,
West Germany, Austria, Luxem-
burg and Ireland. EUREL’S
address is 31 rue Vautier, Brus-
sels, Belgium.

Awards for Swedish Parks
Three national parks in Swedish
Lapland are the latest recipients
of the Diploma for Nature Con-
servation awarded by the Coun—
cil for Europe: Muddus, just
north of the Arctic Circle in Lule
Lappmark, and Sarek and Pad-
jelanta, which are adjacent to
each Other and lie further west,
close to the Norwegian border.
Illustrated booklets on them are
available from the European In-
formation Centre for Nature
Conservation, Council of Europe,
Strasbourg, France. Sarek and
Padjelanta, together with Stora
Sjofallet, which lies a little fur-
ther north, are also the subject
of an excellent illustrate-d booklet
in English, by the eminent con-
servationist Kai Curry-Lindahl,
published by Raben and Sjogren
of Stockholm at 9.50 kr.

The Pillaging of France

The weakness of the French
wildlife conservation laws is lead-
ing to a widespread pillaging of
the French Alps by dealers and
private individuals from Ger-
many, Austria, Italy and Switzer-
land, all of which carefully pro-

9

 




 

tect their own ﬂora and fauna.
Entomological dealers systemat-
ically strip areas of their butter-
ﬂies, caterpillars and chrysalids,
which are often taken for manu-
facture into tourist souvenirs.
Tourists ﬁll the boots of their
cars with wild ﬂowers, including
their r00ts, rhizomes and bulbs.
Already one French nature re-
serve, Le Lauzanier, has had to
be abandoned because of this
rapine. (IUCN Bulletin, July).

Beavers in N. Russia

The beaver, which had long been
exterminated in the Kola Penin-
sula of northern Russia, has now
been successfully restored there
and is increasing at a rate of 10
per cent a year. In the 1930’s a
reserve was set up in the upper
reaches of the River Ponoi, and
several score beavers were
brought from southern Russia.
In very severe weather the re-
serve wardens help them by
deepening their water holes and
replenishing their food resources.
Hunting is strictly controlled.

German Game Law

The new game law of Western
Germany protects all game ani-
mals throughout the year, except
for recognised open seasons for
such standard game animals as
deer, chamois, hares, capercaillie,
blackgame and partridges. It is
curious, however, to ﬁnd open
seasons for the stone and pine
marten (December and January),
badger (July 1 to January 15)
and common and rough-legged
buzzards, goshawk and sparrow-

10

hawk (November to February).
C00t and great crested grebe may
be hunted throughout the year,
except that it is forbidden to
kill parents which are still rear-
ing young. (Information: H.
Deetjen).

To Save the Marismas

The British Ornithologists’
Union has issued an appeal for
funds to help save as much as
possible of the marismas of the
Guadalquivir, which adjoin the
famous Coto Doﬁana nature re-
serve in southern Spain. ”The
more money that can be col-
lected, the greater and more
secure the area that can be saved”,
the Union says, adding that the
money must be raised quickly if
the opportunity is to be seized.
Subscriptions may be sent to the
B.O.U., c/o Bird Room, British
Museum (Natural History),
Cromwell Road, London S.W.7,
and will then be channelled
through the World Wildlife
Fund.

No Lynx for the Valais

The hunters of the Valais, to
whom the decision was left by
the Swiss Federal Government,
have vetoed the proposal of the
Federal Forest Authority to re-
introduce the lynx in the Aletsch

 

nature reserve in the Valais. They
were sufﬁciently out of touch
with modern knowledge of the
value of predators in the eco-
system to fear its effect on their
game. (Schweitzer Nammcbiilz,
Ocrober).

New WWF Appeal

The Swedish National Appeal of
the World Wildlife Fund has
now been ofﬁcially launched.

MammOth Mammoth Find

A very large group of mammoth
remains has been found near the
Pechora River, close to the Arc-
tic Circle. They have been radio-
carbon-dated to 20,000 years ago,
and are the ﬁrst mammoth ﬁnd
in the European part of the
USSR. It is believed that they
represent heaps of bones made
for ceremonial purposes by prim-
itive hunters.

Relief for the Polar Bear

At the instance of the World
Wildlife Fund, a Basle tourist
agency has abandoned its plans
for polar bear hunting expedi-
tions in Spitzbergen in 1969, and
instead has made a donation to
the Fund towards its efforts to
preserve polar bears and other
endangered species.

Iceland’s Bad Winter

The winter of 1967—68 was one
of the coldest in Iceland in living
memory, with temperatures fall-
ing to —30 degrees Centigrade
in places. Unusually large num-
bers of drifting iceﬂoes from the
Arctic were seen off the north

and east coasts, on one of which
a polar bear was seen. (Iceland
Review, no. 2, 1968).

 

North America

 

Spotted Cat Imports

Some striking ﬁgures on the im-
portation of spotted cat skins
into the United States during the
ﬁrst eight months of 1968 have
been produced by the Ofﬁce of
Endangered Species of the
Bureau of Sport Fisheries and
Wildlife. $1,181,000 worth of
leopard skins were imported
from 20 countries, representing
more than 6,000 leopards killed.
The three largest suppliers were
India with 3,253, Kenya with
883 and Ethiopia with 572. From
the other side of the world came
7,238 of the less valuable jaguars,
worth $864,000. Here the three
largest suppliers were Brazil with
4,473, Colombia with 677, and
Mexico with 397.

Poacher Turned Keeper

Louis Kaplan, the well-known
New York furrier, placed an ad-
vertisement in the New York
Timer for September 21 drawing
attention to the depletion of
leopard stocks in Africa by illegal
hunting, and recommending that
women should forgo spotted cat
furs so that 'in 20 years time
your daughters will again wear
them’. The move was warmly
welcomed on behalf of the US.

11

 




  

National Appeal of the World
Wildlife Fund and the New
York Zoological Society, but less
warmly welcomed by other New
York furriers, although some
claimed they were selling more
leopard furs as a result.

Man the Predator

Some striking facts are given by
William G. Conway, General
Director of the New York Zoo-
logical Society, in the Society’s
magazine Animal Kingdom for
June. In 1967 American pet busi-
nesses, laboratories and zoos im-
ported more than 28 million
live wild animals. In the same
year American furriers and
leather goods traders imported
more than 22 million lb of wild
animal skins. At the same time
American hunters were killing
more than 60 million birds and
mammals. . . . Squirrel mon-
keys were being advertised in
New York as ‘the perfect house
pet’ at $13.50. ‘A dozen or so
terribly spoiled ladies in New
York’, ran another advertisement,
‘will get this gift for Christmas,
the "Ultima” II u1200”, our
twelve hundred dollar travel case
of ﬁnest African baby alligator.’
(This means Nile crocodile;
there are no alligators in Africa).

Lab Animals in U.S.A.

A questionnaire from the Insti-
tute of Laboratory Animal Re-
sources has established the num-
bers of animals used for research
purposes in the United States in
1967. The list is headed by 27

million mice, nine million rats,

12

 

more than three million chickens
and over one million hamsters.
Guinea pigs totalled some
848,000, rabbits 639,000, and
monkeys more than 70,000.

Amateur Surgery in U.S.A.
The Animal Welfare Institute
draws attention to the alarming
increase in the number of high
school students of biology con-
ducting highly unsuitable animal
surgery and pathological studies.
Out of a total of 802 biology
projects exhibited at ten science
fairs, one-ﬁfth involved pain or
death to higher animals. It is esti-
mated that some 50,000 such
projects are undertaken in the
United States each year. In one
such experiment a 13-year-old,
working at home, was allowed to
inject 25 mice with LSD, seven
of the mice subsequently dying,
ﬁve of them from faulty injection
procedures. Both the mice and
presumably the LSD were sup-
plied by a reputable government
research institution. Another case
is known of an 18-year-old who
operated on a dog’s heart in a
garage. (AWI Information Re-
port, April).

Fur Seals off California

A colony of up to 100 northern
or Pribilof fur seals was dis-
covered in July on San Miguel
Islands, some 30 miles off Point
Concepcion, California. The only
other known breeding places of

‘this fur seal, which has been

restored from near extinction by
the US. Fish and Wildlife Ser-
vice, are on the Pribilof Islands

of Alaska and a few other islands
in the Bering and Okhotsk Seas
of the USSR. The discovery was
made by a party of scientists
headed by Dr Richard S. Peter-
son, Assistant Professor of Bi-
ology at the University of Cali-
fornia. The site is already in
restricted waters under the con-
trol of the US. Navy, and the
island is included in a Channel
Islands National Park proposed
by the National Park Service.
(AAZPA Newrletter, October).

The Trumpeter Saved
Measures to protect the trum-
eter swan have been so success-
ful that it is now to be deleted
from the Red Book of Rare and
Endangered Fiji) and Wildlife in
the United States. There are at
least 2,200 in the wild in North
America, widely scattered geo-
graphically, in addition to the
specimens in more than 50 zoos.
(Information: Bureau of Sport
Fisheries and Wildlife).

Birds’ Alarm Sounds

Birds respond much better to
their alarm calls or sounds, which
are designed to warn against im-
pending danger, than they do to
their distress calls, which mean
that the danger has actually mate-
rialised, according to Gordon W.
Boudreau in the 7th issue of T/oe
Living Bird from the Cornell
Laboratory of Ornithology. This
might have been deduced from
ﬁrst principles, but nevertheless
distress calls, especially of star-
lings, have been widely used to
scare birds away from airports.

Hitherto the cacophony of the
starling distress sound has
limited its use and has been
largely responsible for its unpop-
ularity as a bird repellent, especi-
ally in the quieter residential
neighbourhoods.

Waterfowl Carrying Young
Do waterfowl ever ﬂy carrying
their young, either in their bills
or on their backs? Hitherto
scientiﬁc waterfowl experts have
tended to pooh-pooh the num-
erous observations of non-scien-
tists to this effect on the grounds
that (a) their bills are ill-adapted
to carrying and (b) that it is im-
probable that they could carry
them on their backs. However,
now that ducks have been proved
to carry egg-shells, and several
Other species, including the
woodcock, have been proved to
carry their young bodily, Paul
Johnsgard and Janet Kear have
reviewed the problem, and con-
clude that “we cannOt dismiss too
casually the fact that some water-
fowl may at times carry the
young in the bill”, while being
able to ﬂy with the young might
have great survival value. (Tloe
Living Bird, no. 7).

A Thirsty Industry

By 1980, according to Senator
Edward Kennedy, the power in-
dustry alone will be using about
20 per cent of all the fresh water
run off in the United States for
its cooling needs. The senator
was introducing a bill directing
the Federal Power Commission
to survey possible sites for ther-

13

 




  

mal and nuclear generating
plants and to publish a plan of
their location. He pointed out
that the industry’s needs have a
potentially disastrous effect on
bOth aquatic wildlife—ﬁsh and
Wildfowl—and agricultural irri-
gation. (Muss. Audubon News-
letter, August).

Conservation in New Jersey
The State of New Jersey has
passed a law, similar to those of
Massachusetts and New York,
empowering municipalities to
establish conservation commis-
sions ‘for the protection, devel-
opment or use of natural
resources, including water re-
sources’. (Audubon Conservation
Guide, October).

Back to the Wild

The Staten Island, New York,
Zoo acquires as many as possible
of the snake eggs that are gath-
ered up by curiosity-seekers in
the New Jersey Pine Barrens and
hatches them out for eventual
release back into their natural
habitat. Most are pine and corn
snakes, and more than 70 corn
snakes alone were hatched and
liberated in ‘the barrens’ during
the 1968 season. Trips have been
made as far away as North and

 

South Carolina, and Syracuse,
New York, to release hatchlings
in their precise habitat and
locality. (AAZPA Newsletter,
October).

Proﬁtable Forests

Products and services from the
187 million acres of national
forests administered by the US.
Forest Service brought in a
record $207 million in the ﬁscal
year 1967-68, of which $52
million will be distributed to the
states in which the forests lie.
(Conservation News, October).

Bad Year for Waterfowl

Last summer was catastrophic for
North American waterfowl, with
the toral breeding population
down to 16 per cent, largely as
a result of the widespread drying
up of potholes and ponds, whose
numbers fell from a normal two
million to about 600,000 by late
June. Blue-winged teal were
down by 30 per cent, redheads
by 22, pintail by 12 and mallard
by 4. On the Other hand gadwall
increased by 40 per cent, bald-
pates by 22 and canvasbacks by
13. (Muss. Audubon Newsletter,
August).

For Documentary Photographs
A National Photoduplicate File,
in the form of 35 mm. slides, is
to be established at the Patuxent
Migratory Bird Populations Sta-
tion in Maryland, under the aus-
pices of the US. Fish and Wild-
life Service. It will preserve
photographs that serve to docu-
ment the presence of rarities and
to substantiate extra-seasonal
occurrences, range extensions,
breeding records and so forth.
The photographs will also be
published in Audubon Field
Notes.

Education in the Galapagos
Sr Lucio Saltos Gomez has been
appointed by the Ecuadorian

Ministry of Education to orga-
nise and co-ordinate conservation
education in the Galapagos
Islands. For the past four years
Sr Saltos has been working
closely with the Charles Darwin
Research Station to develop edu-
cation programmes to promote
an understanding of conserva-
tion needs and principles among
the islands’ communities. This
new post will enable him to ex-
tend the teaching of conserva-
tion biology in the islands’
schools, and to develop pro-
grammes for adult education,
exhibitions and training courses
for the future guides of the Gala-
pagos National Park.

Guyana Wildlife Attacked
Jaguars, tapirs, capybaras, pec-
caries, sloths, anteaters, arma-
dillos, several species of monkey
and many other kinds of wildlife
still frequent the elevated hinter-
land of Guyana. Within recent
years, however, they have been
subjected to indiscriminate
slaughter by bands of Amerin-
dians from across the Venezu-
elan border. Arapaimas, caimans,
capybaras, otters and turtles have
all been overhunted, and face ex-
tinction unless the organised
poaching can be checked. (Wild
Life and Conservation in Guy-
unu : report from Field Research
Projects, no. 8).

Mountain Tapir Threatened

The demand from zoos for moun-
tain tapirs, which are virtually
conﬁned to Colombia and Ecua-
dor, has led local animal dealers

15

 

 




 

to mount several expeditions to
capture them this year. To obtain
the dozen or so tapirs which
reached Quito in 1968 it is be-
lieved that more than 60 wild
tapirs had to be killed. To check
this potentially disastrous drain
on the tapir stocks, IUCN is
seeking the collaboration of bOth
the International Union of Direc-
tors of Zoological Gardens and
the American Association of
Zoological Parks and Aquariums
to ban the purchase of any fur-
ther specimens of this rarest of
the tapirs. (IUCN Bulletin, Oct.).

Lake Atitlan Grebe

The latest census of the giant
pied-billed grebe, at its only
known breeding site on Lake
Atitlan, Guatemala, early in 1968
yielded a count of 116, an in-
crease of ten per cent on June
1967 and of 20-25 per cent on
the low level reached in 1965-66.
A presidential decree now pro-
hibits the cutting of reeds or cat-
tails on the lake during the
grebes’ breeding season from
May to August. Four birds,
which it is hoped will make two
pairs, have been transported to
the National Grebe Refuge,
which was ofﬁcially opened in
June. (World Wildlife Fund).

Another Ancient Seed Lives

The seed of a species of reed still
to be determined was recently
taken from a 530-year-old Amer-
indian necklace and germinated
by botanists at La Plata Univer-
sity, Argentina. The necklace,
consisting of walnut shells, each

16

with a rattling seed inside, was
found during excavations of an
Indian city in north-eastern Ar-
gentina. A llama bone from a
nearby rubbish-tip has been
radio-car‘bon-dated to about 1420
AD. (The Timer, September 20).

Threat in Juan Fernandez

Increasing numbers of domestic
livestock are severely damaging
the endemic ﬂora of Juan Fer-
nandez, the ‘Robinson Crusoe’
islands 350-450 miles off the
coast of Chile. There are 3,000
sheep and 1,000 cattle on Mas a
Tierra island alone, not to men-
tion goats and rabbits. Only
on the inaccessible cliffs of El
Yunque is the endemic ﬂora safe-
from goats and other livestock.
Introduced plants, such as the
European bramble and the Chile-
an maqui Aristotelici cloinenrir,
are a further threat to the native
ﬂora. The native sandalwood
Sanmlnin fernnndezinnnin has
already gone and the endemic
palm Innninn nnrtmlir has seri-
ously declined. (IUCN Bulletin,

July).

 

Africa

New African Convention

At the Conference of Heads of
States and Governments of the
OAU at Algiers in September
the African Convention for Con-
servation of Nature and Natural
Resources was approved and
signed by 38 member states. The

 

 

new convention replaces the
London Convention of 1953, and
was prepared by OAU with the
Advice of IUCN. Its aim is to
‘ensure the conservation, utilisa-
tion and development of soil,
water, ﬂora and faunal resources
in accordance with scientiﬁc
principles and with due regard to
the best interests of the people’.

Poaching at Q.E.

Trafﬁc in game meat and skins is
now known to be going on be-
tween the Congo, Rwanda and
Uganda, according to the quar-
terly report of the Uganda
National Parks. .It is understood
that Rwanda is being used as the
base for legalising wild animal
trophies before sending them
overseas or offering the-m for sale
on the local market. In the Ish-
asha section of the Queen Eliza-
beth National Park many topi
have been killed. A. well-beaten
track, used by the Congo rebels
as they travel back and forth
to collect food supplies from
Uganda, has been discovered in
the park north of Mpondwe.
These rebels also poach within
the park. Another illegal trade
exists in the area of QUE adjacent
to Dura railway station, the
smoked and dried meat being
railed to Kampala in bags
labelled as charcoal.

The Great Rhino Movement

Up to the end of May 1968,
Operation Rhino, which was
launched in 1961 to relieve the
pressure of the increasing num-
ber of white rhinos in the Um—

folozi game reserve in Zululand
on their habitat, had shifted 482
animals. Of these 78 were
shipped overseas, 57 of them to
the United States, and the re-
mainder to various parts of
Africa south of the Sahara. Of
the latter group, 96 went to the
Kruger National Park, 92 to
other parts of the Transvaal, 78
to Other parts of South Africa, 82
to Rhodesia (35 to the Wankie
national park), and 38 to Mozam-
bique. (Lmnmergeyer, Oct.).

Translocating Puku

When, as seems likely, the Puku
Flats are ﬂooded after the build-
ing of the Meshi-Teshi darn, it is
planned to translocate the 300
puku antelope that live there to
another site about 15 miles away.
This will avoid the necessity of a
costly Kariba-type rescue opera-
tion. However, a snag has just
developed in the capacity of
translocated puku to home over
this distance, and further experi-
ments are obviously necessary.
(Black Lee/awe, August).

Roads in National Park

There is no doubt, according to
Dr U. de V. Pienaar in the 1968
Koe‘cloe, that by far the greater
part of the erosion in the Kruger
Park is man-made, and more
often than n0t is associated with
some road - building activity
in the past. Moreover, heavy
tourist trafﬁc along certain roads
is a deﬁnite limiting factor to the
movements and daily routines of
timid species and breeding herds
of other species. The limits thus

17

 

 

 

 




 

imposed on available grazing
areas or favourite watering points
may be so severe that the animals
may be forced into adjoining
areas, which may not be entirely
suitable to their needs or which
are already occupied by resident
herds. This applies particularly
to elephants, while timid species,
such as eland and sable, may be
forced right outside the park by

excessive numbers of tourists.

New Lodges for Uganda

A preliminary agreement be-
tween the Uganda Development
Corporation and Danish Turn-
key Hotels Ltd, provides for an
extensive hotels development
programme, which will be ﬁn-
anced from a new £1 million
Danish loan to Uganda. Sites
have been recommended at Mur-
chison Falls National Park (a
100-bed lodge at Pakuba and a
60-bed extension to Paraa), and
Kidepo National Park (a 24-bed
lodge). (Ugana’a Argnr).

Celebrations in Malawi

The National Fauna Preservation
Society of Malawi celebrated its
coming of age with a dinner at
Limbe, attended by 60 members
and their guests, on September27.
The President, who is the
Society’s patron, was represented
by the Hon. G. W. Kumtumanji,
Minister of Local Government
and Health. A life-size cut-out of
a nyala ram, made by an artist
member, was exhibited, prior to
being placed in the rest camp at
the Lengwe game reserve, Mal-
awi’s nyala sanctuary.

Rhinos at Udjung Kulon

The latest report from Dr and
Mrs Schenke-l, who are engaged
in the World Wildlife Fund pro-
ject to save the Javan rhino at its
sole remaining known site, the
Udjung Kulon Reserve at the
western tip of Java, describes a
further census taken in August,
which showed a minimum of 19
and a maximum of 29 different
animals, including, for the ﬁrst
time for several years, a calf.

(World Wildlife Fund).

The Lion-tailed Monkey
There are now probably fewer
than 1,000 lion-tailed monkeys
Macarca Jilennr left in the world,
and if steps are not taken to pro-
tect them, they will become ex-
tinct, according to Yukimaru
Sugiyama in the Journal of the
Bombay Natural History Society
for August. They have always
been restricted to the part of
India lying between 140 N. and
the southern ends of the Western
Ghats, but hunting for their
meat and beautiful fur has greatly
reduced this range. Today they
are restricted to the mountains
between 90 30’ and 110 30’ N.,
from the Nilgiri Hills to Peri-
yar Lake.

White-winged Wood Duck

The white-winged wood duck
Catrina rentnlata is one of the
world’s rarest waterfowl, whose
nest has never been found,

 

although it ranges from Assam
south to Java. Nothing is cur-
rently known of its status from
Burma southwards, and in Assam
its numbers are now very low.
Only one or two individuals
appear to survive in the Dibru-
garh sanctuary created for it a
few years ago, and M. J. S. Mac-
kenzie of the D‘eamoolie Tea
Estate is seeking to interest the
Assam Forest Department in a
project to save the remnant from
extinction. (IUCN Bulletin,
October).

Protecting the Takin

The takin, a rare ungulate of the
mountains of northern Burma,
northern Assam and north-
western China is to be completely
protected in Burma. (Rangoon
Gaavra'z'an, September 5). The
continued sh00ting of this rare
animal in Kachin State has made
this step necessary. Many animals
are believed to be shot and left
lying, their meat not being
utilised.

More Pheasants for Taiwan
Six more pairs of Swinhoe’s
pheasant have been sent by the
Ornamental Pheasant Trust to
Taiwan for release from the
original release pen in the Che-
Chi Experimental Forest. The
cost of their transport has been
grant-aided by the Joint Revolv-
ing Fund of the Fauna Preserva-
tion Society and the World Wild-
life Fund.

Drought in Rajasthan
More than a million cattle and

other animals have already per-
ished of hunger and dehydration
in the serious drought now
affecting Rajasthan and Gujarat,
India. (Information: I.S.P.A.).

 

Australasia

 

The Great Barrier Reef

Four recent events have threat-
ened the Great Barrier Reef off
the north-eastern coast of Aus-
tralia: a plague of the crown-
of thorns seastar Acant/oarter
planet, which attacks the coral
animals; the granting of licences
to prospeCt for oil offshore; an
application for permission to
mine coral detritus on Ellison
Reef (which was refused); and
the destruction of large numbers
of giant clams by the crews of
foreign ﬁshing vessels. The Aus-
tralian Conservation Foundation
has recommended that a proper
survey of all aspects of the Great
Barrier Reef should be made
before any further action to per-
mit exploitation of any kind is
taken. It has joined with the
Great Barrier Reef Committee in
proposing that this survey should
be carried out by a team of quali-
ﬁed investigators, over a period
of two or three years if necessary.
(ACF Newsletter, July).

Queensland Conserves Turtles
The Queensland Government
has prohibited the taking of any

19

 

 




  

species of turtle or its eggs in the
waters or on the shores of the
state. This is the culmination of
four years research into turtle
ecology by Dr Robert Bustard of
the Australian National Univer-
sity, and is the most important
single piece of turtle conserva-
tion legislation so far enacted
anywhere in the world. Five
species of marine turtle and their
eggs are now fully prOtected
along 2,500 miles of coast as well
as 1,200 miles of the Great Bar-
rier Reef. (Om/x, December).

Takahe and Kakapo

Extensive surveys were made last
year of the known habitat of both
these rare New Zealand birds,
and of areas where unconﬁrmed
reports suggest that small popu-
lations might still survive. The
range of the takahe was slightly
extended by the sighting of a
few birds in the Stuart Moun-
tains, but the overall population
is still estimated at 400-500
birds. The status of the kakapo
in their known range in the Mil-
ford region remains precarious,
with very low numbers. (Ofﬁcial
New Zealand Report on Wildlife
Research).

Tasmanian Conservation
Largely as a result of the Lake
Pedder controversy in 1967, a
Tasmanian Conservation Trust
has been formed, with Dr J. L.
Davies of the University of Tas-
mania as President. Its address is
Box 684G, G.P.O., Hobart, Tas.
7001.

The Nature Conservancy has de-
clared a new nature reserve at
Saltfleetby-Theddlethorpe Dunes
on the coast of Lincolnshire, part
of which has hitherto been man-
aged as a reserve by the Lincoln-
shire Naturalists’ Trust. The
Conservancy has bought 293
acres from the Ministry of De-

Dear Christine,

This feature article is being sent for Mr. Jack Howard's
approval and placement. It is meant for publication
either in the magazine section of a newspaper, or as one
in a series in the regular sections of a paper.

Yours and Mrs. Leavitt's "Animals and Their Legal Rights”
has been of great help in preparing this article, as you will

. SEQ.

The part involving the newspapers' contribution and
the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act will be found on page 17-20.
Your publication is mentioned on page 7. ( and again in gather}.
. , art.)
Please feel free to changéf with pencil, directly on
the copy, anything you choose and I will pick it up aroudd
ll a.m. tomorrow if you will call me.

I am thrilled and excited because Mr. Howard has
permitted me to send these, but I am also apprehensive because
my feeling toward the subject is much stronger than my
capability in journalism -- hence I am prone to overplay.

Thanks so much for your help.

Fondly,

 




 

Q. Dear Alice: Ever know
of a cat who likes olives?
Our Harry does! When we
put our Christmas treats on
the cocktail table, I came back
to find Harry had s’nitched

on the olives out of the dish!
Will olives give our Harry
a tumMy ache?

A. Of course not! I became
very well acquainted with a
brown cat called Charlie who
adored Martini olives. He be-
longs to TV actress Pamela
Mason. When I visited her
home in California~ one day,

‘Charlie left his tooth marks
' on every olive he pawed out
of the glasses! It was almost
‘ cat~a-strophic!

it?

A. In bitter cold weather,
use your crumpled newspap‘

will have a sick puppy. Take
him to these newSpapers im-

and before bedtime. When the
weather gets warmer, and we
have sunshine, you can take
newspapers out to a certain
corner in your yard, and
puppy will soon realize where
he is to perform his duties.
Be patient! Kind! Never, nev-

Thursday Eve

Dear Christine,

would you be so kind as to check this article for accuracy
and offer any suggestions on other points too, if necessary.
I held all of the articles over for a week.

I took this part out of the other article and made this an
extra one becaue I felt that the subject is current and needs special
emphasis just as you did in your article. we need circulation in any
locations we can find. I have not met anyone who knows the difference
between the Rogerquavits kind of bill and the one that is now a ﬂaw.
And the other one sounds actually desirable unless one knows the
background and the purpose.

Your article was of great help to me. I regret having to:
bother you further, but you are the one person who knows all sides
of the question, and it is better to delay everything that to send in
something that is not correct or upeto~date. I'm.truly glad you rescued
me.
I may see you at the hearings on the 19th and 20th.

Sherry
Telephone: 493 6434

P.S. Call me twmorrow.sometime if you think any additions, omissions
or corrections are needed. Otherwise just mail my copy back
when you find the time.

The Truth
About ;

Drew Pearson 1

By Patrick Anderson

REW PEARSON, America‘s most
D widely read and most powerful

journalist, remains a paradox after
nearly forty years in the public eye. He
is famed as a journalistic hatchet man,
yet it may be closer to the truth to see
, him as a political crusader. No news-
paper writer has been denounced by
more of the nation’s politicians, or ap—
preciated by more of the people who
elect those politicians. Few syndicated
columnists are more liberal in their p‘ol-
itics, yet no columnist is printed in more
of the conservative newspapers of small-
town America. The potency of Pearson’s
New Dealish progressivism has always
been better understood by right—wingers,
who hate him, than by left-wingers, who
usually dismiss him with a shrug.

The essential Pearson is surrounded,
almost obscured, by colorful diversions:
He was once married to an authentic
countess; he feuded in print with the
countess’ mother, who was newspaper
publisher Cissy Patterson; he owns a
farm that sells manure billed as “Drew
Pearson’s Best—Better Than the Col-
umn”; he was kneed in the groin by Joe
McCarthy; he splashed in the Black Sea
with Nikita Khrushchev; his interna—
tionalism has often been expressed in
such Barnumesque ventures as 1951’s
Freedom Balloons, which sent thousands
of goodwill messages soaring paSt the
Iron Curtain by balloon.

All this makes good copy, but it is
largely irrelevant. The one vital fact
about Drew Pearson—to Pearson himself,
to his allies and his enemies, to his role

in the political process—is just this: He

writes, and has been writing for thirty-
ﬁve years, a daily, eight hundred word

column that is published in six hundred

PHOTOS BY J. WAYNE HIGGS

newspapers with a total readership of
forty million. By comparison, the second-
ranking political columnist in terms of
subscribers is the conservative David
Lawrence, with about 350 papers; far-
ther back, William F. Buckley, Jr., has
165 and Joseph Kraft, 110.

The political implications of Pearson’s
readership are staggering. Political prog—
ress in a democracy must be built upon
public awareness—on whom and what
the people believe—and Pearson has been
in more direct communication with more
Americans for a longer time than any
politician, any novelist, any religious
leader, or any other journalist.

Pearson won his mass audience not

because of his progressive political be-
liefs, but despite them. He captured his
readers with a brilliant, often outrageous
blend of political gossip, exposés, senti-
mentality, showmanship, and muckrak-
ing. Himself the most political of men, he
has come to embody the national distrust
of politicians. Millions of his readers
look to Pearson to keep their elected

- ofﬁcials honest, and his part in the down-

falls of Congressman Adam Clayton
Powell and Senator Thomas Dodd is
only the latest chapter in three decades
of political exposés.

, But for Pearson the exposés and show-
manship have always been means to an
end. He is like one of those Southern
politicians who treats a crowd to two
hours of hillbilly music before he in-
ﬂicts on them his one hour of speech-
making. Pearson is not writing for the
politically aware, college—trained urban-
ites of the east and west coasts, but for
the apolitical millions of the mid-Amer-
ican Heartland, and having won them
with his exposes, he can now and then

penetrate the Heartland with such nug-
gets as these:

“What causes the. real trouble for the
U. S. in Latin America is not Castro
but poverty and the wide gap between
the wealthy aristocracy and the land-
less, illiterate peasants.”
January 1963, in criticizing
JFK’s saber-rattling speech
to the Cuban refugees in
Miami.
“What the U. S. needs today is a giant
Marshall Plan to rebuild the ghettos of
our big cities and rehabilitate their
people. We have Negro insurrection
in our major cities with effects worse
than communism, all because we refuse
to remedy the basic causes—poverty,
slum housing, overcrowded schools,
inadequate teachers, alcoholism, and
crime.” '
July 1967, after the Detroit riot.

“The military dictatorship in Greece
has resulted from the U. 8., for'twenty
years, pouring in military aid while
ignoring political and military reform.”

May 1967, after the coup in Greece.

“Our chief accomplishment in Vietnam
has been to laill 200,000 men. Our bomb-
ing of North Vietnam hasn’t helped im—
prove the situation in the South. . . .
Very few villages are secure. . . . The
South Vietnamese Army is almost worth-

lessf’
July 1967.

These statements will not excite read-
ers of, say, the New Y orla Times or the
New Republic, but the point is that Pear-
son’s column goes to hundreds of com-
munities where those journals do nor, and

is read by people who otherwise rarely
hear the liberal line. The unsolved prob-
lem of American liberalism is how to
reach these very people, people to whom
the problems of urban America seem
strange and distant, people whose
thoughts on foreign affairs are too often
at the level of “If we don’t stop the
Communists in Vietnam, next thing we’ll
be ﬁghting them in California.” It has
been Pearson’s peculiar role to be a lib-
eral who does reach these people. Just
what impact his oversimpliﬁed, far from
consistent statement of progressive politi-
cal views has had on the thoughts and
votes of his millions of readers is beyond
objective measurement. But no one in
politics would argue that it has been
inconsiderable.

contemporaries in public life, Pearson

compares most closely with Lyndon
Johnson. Like Johnson he is ﬂamboyant,
vainglorious, emotional, ruthless, maud-
lin, shrewd, corny, power-obsessed,
effective, durable. Like Johnson he is
liberal when he can be, conservative
when he must be, consistent only in self-
interest. Like Johnson, he built a vast
national constituency because of his
ability to be all things to all men on a
grand scale.

Theodore White once. said that Lyn-
don Johnson could only be fully appreci-
ated in his proper setting—White sug-
gested a meeting of small-town Southern
Democrats in the local Masonic temple
with the ladies of the Eastern Star serv-
ing a hot lunch. Pearson, too, to be fully
appreciated, must be viewed not only
in his role of muckraker and reformer,
but in its corollary, his role as Uncle
Drew—traditionalist, ﬂag-waver, writer
of sentimental columns to his grandchil-
dren, man' of goodwill and common
sense.

He was glimpsed in this role one day
early this year as he addressed a lunch-
eon meeting of‘the Washington Jaycees
in the ballroom of a downtown hotel.
His and the Jaycees’ common interest in
the Big Brothers youth program had
brought him there, but they seemed to
have little else in common. The Jaycees
were Nixonites to a man, screwed-up-
tight young admen and dry-goods im-
presarios who whooped and clapped
their way through the luncheon’s inter—
minable announcements: the Member—
ship Committee and the Program Com—
mittee and the Christmas Party and the

I t has often seemed to me that, of all his

Boss of the Year Award and the Man
of the Year Award and the Woman
Behind the Man of the Year Award and
the Basketball Team’s progress (“We’re
still undefeated—all the way, menl”)

Throughout these sacraments, Drew
Pearson sat quietly at the head table,
just beneath a purple and gold banner
proclaiming the Jaycee Creed, smiling.
There was something beautifully incon-
gruous about the scene: Pearson, an old
radical who had been passionately and
endlessly denounced by every right-of-
center notable from Joe McCarthy to
Dwight Eisenhower—this same Pearson
here being honored by an organization
that is the very quintessence of respect-
able American conservatism. He seemed
the proverbial whore come to church.

So it must have seemed to others as
well, for as Pearson was introduced,
some of his young hosts were smirking
at one another as they applauded him.
But Pearson had been smirked at before,
and he moved smoothly into his civic
luncheon routine, one he has delivered
a thousand times in his trips across the
nation. He told how Harry Truman
had called him an S.O.B., but that had
really meant Servant Of Brotherhood.
He told his brassiere joke: abOut the
Communist bra (“supports the masses”),
the Salvation Army bra (“uplifts the
fallen”), and the Drew Pearson bra
(“makes mountains out of molehills”).
The two or three wives present blushed
demurely and the Jaycees roared.

Pearson stood there, quite relaxed, one
hand in his pants pocket, clad in a suit-
ably undistinguished blue suit, an elderly
gentleman with pink cheeks and a de-
ﬁant moustache who managed to discuss
the problems of urban America for
twenty minuteswithout saying a word
that would have offended Barry Gold-
water: “We must help these fatherless
boys lest they drift into a life of crime.
. . . The greatest factor in preventing
crime is the Family. . . . I believe the
Jaycees and the Big Brothers reﬂect the
best in the Free Enterprise-Capitalist
System. . . . The remedy is not "for Con-
gress to pass more laws—the remedy is
Love!”

When he ﬁnished they gave him a
plaque and some ﬂowers for his wife
and, this time, a heartfelt ovation. Pear-
son had turned the Jaycees on with his
brassiere joke and his invocations 0f the
Family and Love to cure the urban
crisis. For years, they had heard that
Pearson was a left-winger, a radical;

now, as they ﬁled out of that enchanted
ballroom, they were not so sure. Half
of political success lies in disarming
one’s opponents, and Pearson’s perform-
ance for the Jaycees was a small but
lovely instance of this art as performed
by a master. ‘

Pearson has zigged and zagged, he has
been all things to all men, and yet when
the time has come, on the big issues, he
has taken his stand and it has usually
been the right stand. He fought Joe
McCarthy as hard and as effectively as
anyone, and he has fought the Klan and
George Wallace and the oil and drug
lobbies and the military-industrial com-
plex. He has given important support to
crusaders like Estes Kefauver and Paul
Douglas, and for consumer legislation,
foreign aid, domestic welfare programs,
and an East-West détente.

‘He returned from his 1961 meeting
with Premier Khrushchev convinced that
the Russian leader wanted accommoda—
tion with the West. When he told his
partner, Jack Anderson, that he planned
a series of columns on Khrushchev’s de-‘
sire for peace, Anderson, a relentless in-
vestigative reporter who is unencum-
bered by ideological baggage, pleaded
with him not to write them. In the ﬁrst

at ease. He wears a wine-colored smok-
ing jacket and he greets .a visitor with the
informality of a country squire. Only
the clatter of the teletype machines in
the next room belies the bucolic mood
of the place.

“What are your most important con-
tributions to the passage of legislation
on Capitol Hill?” he is asked. He ﬁrst
mentions his part in obtaining Federal
regulation of the sale of Wall Street
securities in 1931. Then he jumps for—
ward a decade and a half to the years
just after the Second World War:

“I helped put across civilian control of
atomic weapons. At the end of the war,
the Army controlled the atomic bomb.
I joined with Senator Brian McMahon of
Connecticut to back legislation to set up
the Atomic Energy Commission. When
the question was in the balance I invited
to a private dinner some of the leading

place, Anderson insisted, you couldn’t-
trust Khrushchev. (“That guy got where
he is the same way a Maﬁa boss does”)
Secondly, Anderson argued, whether or
not Pearson was right about Khrushchev,
the John Birch Society, then in its prime,
would roast him for being soft on com-
munism.

“We’ll lose papers,” warned Anderson,
making the ultimate argument.

“I don’t care,” Pearson replied. “It’s
what I think and I’ve got to print it.”

So he did write the series, and he did
lose some papers, and a few years later
he could immodestly claim that his col-
umns had helped pave the way for the
nuclear test-ban treaty, the nonprolifera-
tion treaty, and other milestones of So-
viet-American accord. And in fact, to
some immeasurable but not inconsequen-
tial degree, they had. \

 

earson lives and works in a large,

handsome yellow brick house in

Georgetown. A visitor
through a gate on Twenty—ninth Street,
passes through a rose garden and into
an outer ofﬁce containing Pearson’s three
secretaries. A photograph of Pearson and
Lyndon Johnson hangs over a ﬁreplace
—three more such pictures adorn Pear-
son’s own ofﬁce—and along the opposite
wall are a dozen grey ﬁle cabinets which,
one assumes, contain the fruits of three
decades’ muckraking. The index card on
one cabinet bears the intriguing notation,
“Mesta—Negro.”

Pearson’s own ofﬁce is in the next
room. It is small, cluttered with books
and papers, and looks out on the rose
garden. On the wall behind his desk is
a portrait of his granddaughter in a
ballerina costume; on the opposite wall is
a portrait of his father. The front of
Pearson’s desk is covered by a half—dozen
wooden in-boxes; in one of them there
sleeps a large brown and white cat
named Skunkie. Now and then Skunkie
will stretch, walk across the desk to be
scratched by Pearson, or leap to the
ﬂoor to rub against a visitor’s leg.

Pearson sits behind the desk, and, like
Skunkie, he is old, large, and very much

enters

Republican Senators who were against
it, and had in some atomic scientists to
tell them the whole story. We won the
AEC vote, and Senator McMahon al-
ways thought that dinner tipped the
balance.”

He recalled how he helped Estes Ke-
fauver launch the 1950 underworld in-
vestigations that projected the Tennessee
Senator into the Presidential race in
1952:

“I had written a series of columns on
the Maﬁa, independent of Kefauver, but
he had the same idea. He introduced a
resolution to investigate the rackets but
he couldn’t get it passed. I went to Scott
Lucas, the Majority Leader, and told
him he ought to let it through. I
warned him that some people said he
had received campaign contributions
from gamblers, and it might look bad if
he blocked Kefauver’s investigation.”

“Couldn’t that warning be interpreted
as . . .” his visitor begins.

“Blackmail?” Pearson injects. “Oh, no.
Lucas was a good friend of mine.”

Pearson is asked if it is true that his
muckraking has been a means to an end,
with the advancement of his political
beliefs his primary objective. He answers
a bit reluctantly, like a magician asked
about the rabbits up his sleeve, but in the
afﬁrmative:

“Yes, the people who dwell on the
controversies fail to see through to the
fact that I’ve been trying to do some—
thing for the country and the world.
For instance, we were hammering away
at Medicare for years when it waS-highly
unpopular, when all the doctors were

calling it socialism. But the pounding
away of columns to put across construc-
tive things is not spectacular. It’s the
exposés that sell the column. I plead
guilty to being a showman. My sister
tells my wife that I’m a frustrated actor.
But I’ve always maintained that you have
to tell your story so it will be read.”

The door behind Pearson opens, the
door to his living quarters, and his wife
appears in search of the morning paper.
Luvie Pearson is wearing a camel-colored
pants suit, and she is tall, blonde, and
patrician. When they met in the 1930’s,
after Pearson’s divorce from the countess,
Luvie was married to a wealthy news—
paperman named Abell. Her divorce
from Abell and marriage to Pearson was
a sensational episode at the time, com-
plete with a custody ﬁght over her son,
Abell’s threats to kill Pearson, and Pear-
son’s carrying a gun in case he tried.
Such were the passions of yesteryear;
today Luvie Pearson is a striking woman
of middle years, a woman one sees lunch-
ing at the Rive Gauche in Georgetown
or La Grenouille in New York with
other sleek, expensive women.

Luvie departs with the Washington
Post but she leaves behind, like good
perfume, a whiff of elegance that belies
Pearson’s old-shoe manner; men who
attract elegant women often possess an
elegance of spirit that does not immedi-
ately meet the eye.

The talk turns to Lyndon Johnson, of
whom Pearson has little bad to say these
days, and Robert Kennedy, of whom he
_ has little good to say. Pearson insists

that he considers Kennedy to have been
a good Attorney General and to be a
good Senator. Then why, he is asked,
is he forever criticizing him in the col-
umn?

“Well, Bobby is vindictive,” Pearson
says.

“Isn’t the same true of Johnson?”

“Oh, no. Johnson blows hot and cold,
but he’s not vindictive.”

The visitor asks if Pearson’s own deep
doubts about the U. S. involvement in
Vietnam don’t put him closer to RFK
than to LBJ on the war issue.

'“Ah, but you’ll notice I never criticize
Bobby about his dissent from the Viet-
nam policy.”

Pearson is asked about his relationship
with Johnson, and in particular a report
that the President had called him about
one of his recent columns.

“No,” he insisted, “he didn’t call me.
I called him.”

After a moment, he added: “Look, I

for the most part treated him
generously. He never cared for Robert

Kennedy.”

the impression that I’m trying to tell
the President what to do.”

“Isn’t it your job to tell Presidents
What to do?”

“Yes, I suppose it is,” Pearson said.
“But Johnson is so sensitive. Look, I
know he reads the column, and I think it
inﬂuences him, but I don’t want him to
think I’m bragging about my inﬂuence.
He’s going to be mad enough when he
reads What I’m writing about Walt
Rostow.” -

Pearson, in his occasional criticism of
the war in Vietnam, has thus far man-
aged to avoid blaming the President for

it. After theViet Cong offensive of Feb- '

ruary 1968 he called for the ﬁring of
General Westmoreland; next, he planned
an attack on ROStow, the hawkish White
House aide.

Pearson’s phone rings, and he takes a
call from the young lawyer-crusader,
Ralph Nader, who has been closely
allied with Pearson in recent legislative
ﬁghts for an auto—safety bill, Federal

standards for gas pipeline safety, and
beter meat inspection laws. Nader is
calling to report an industry maneuver
to block the gas pipeline bill. Pearson
listens intently, jotting notes on a yellow
legal pad. Finally he asks, “How does
Staggers feel about this?” He means
Harley Staggers, the chairman of the
House committee handling the pipeline
bill. “No,” he tells Nader, “I’ll talk to
him. He’s an old friend of mine.”

His visitor’s hour is up. Pearson offers
to extend it, but the visitor is tempo-
rarily out of questions, so he ejects
Skunkie from his lap, is helped into his
coat, and departs. In the outer ofﬁce he
passes Pearson’s next caller, a prominent

umnist’s support in a campaign for Con—

s all this suggests—Pearson’s mem-
ories of battles fought, his partner-
ship with Nader, the would-be

Congressman in his outer ofﬁce—Capitol

 

  




 

Hill is his natural arena, the place he can
best apply his powers and achieve his
goals. His and Anderson’s next book,
to be published soon, is called The Case
Against Congress. Pearson’s ﬁrst novel
(written with an assist from novelist
Gerald Green), scheduled for publica-
tion this fall, is titled The Senator and
is, he admits, more fact than ﬁction.
His own status in Washington has long
been roughly comparable to that of a
powerful, entrenched, particularly venge-
ful Senator.

His role as public educator is hard to
evaluate, but his role as watchdog over
Congress can be more clearly seen. His
relationship with most members of Con—
gress is simple: They’re scared to death
of him. It is a two-edged fear: Congress-
men don’t want to be on Pearson’s
blacklist (his assistants sometimes begin
talks with politicians, “Do you want on
Drew’s blacklistP”), but they don’t want
to seem too chummy with him either,
lest their colleagues suspect them of
leaking stories to him. The result is that
scores of Congressmen serve as secret
sources of information for Pearson.
(The same is true of executive branch
ofﬁcials, and it is this very profusion of
sources which leads to Pearson’s biggest
fault—his countless mistakes, half-truths,
and distortions. Apparently while some
of these are politically inspired, others
result from a reluctance to make that ex-
tra fact—checking phone call—the one
that might ruin a good story. The back-
lash from his attacks causes him to keep
a libel lawyer busy almost full time set-
ling cases out of court.)

No other columnist concerns himself
with the Congressmen’s endless junkets,
and many junkets are never taken for
fear of his exposure. No other national
columnist will report that a Philadelphia
Congressman’s son was involved in a pa-
ternity suit. No other columnist will
print the names of House Democrats
who failed to vote for aid to Appalachia,
adding to each name such comments as
“one of our champion junketeers,” or
“a big booster of funds for outer space,”
or “put his nephew on the Un-American
Activities Committee payroll.”

Now‘and then, House leaders, to save
members from having to take a stand on
hard issues, will arrange unrecorded
votes, wherein the members “vote” by
simply ﬁling past the Clerk’s desk to be
counted. Pearson, in such cases, will have
his assistant, Tom McNamara, on duty in
the House press gallery to record the un—
recorded vote, so the stand of key Mem-
bers can be reported in his column the

next day. This is no small feat, since it
depends on McNamara’s being able to
identify almost all the 435 Members by
sight.

Few Congressmen can afford to ignore
Pearson’s jabs, for they can start talk
back home, mobilize letter writers, snow-
ball into major political problems. One
prominent Senator who was driven to
near distraction by Pearson’s pinpricks
in the 1950’s was Lyndon B. Johnson.
In those days, Pearson felt Johnson was
too cosy with the oil lobby and had been
soft on McCarthy, and he liked to call
him “Landslide Lyndon” and “Lyin’-
Down Johnson.”

But in 1959 Pearson decided he wanted
to block Eisenhower’s nomination of
Lewis Strauss as Secretary of Commerce,
and he knew that his only hope of doing
so was to “make a deal with Lyndon.”
Jack Anderson was therefore dispatched
to the Majority Leader’s office.

“How would you like to get Drew off
your. back?” he asked Johnson.

“Who do I have to kill?” Johnson
replied.

Lewis Strauss, Anderson replied, and
explained what Pearson wanted. It was
impossible, Johnson said. Okay, Ander-
son said, and started for the door. Wait,
Johnson called, maybe it was not impos—
sible. Terms were negotiated, agree-
ment was reached, Strauss was defeated,
and Pearson, for a time, was off John—
son’s back.

Pearson’s enemies—and he and Johnson
were never enemies, just rivals—fear
most of all his willingness to saturate an
issue, to hammer away at it day after
day, before other writers have recog-
nized it or after they have drOpped it.
Had he and Anderson written only one
or two columns about Tom Dodd’s finan—
cial dealings, nothing would have hap-
pened. It was only by writing dozens
of columns that Pearson and Anderson
were able to force other, more respect-
able journalists to look into Dodd’s tan-
gled affairs, force public concern about
the charges, and eventually force the
Senate to take action.

Similarly, during the last two weeks
before the ﬁrst censure vote on Joe Mc-
Carthy, Pearson devoted almost every
column either to damning McCarthy or
praising his critics. It is this sort of sat-
uration, day after day after day, that
grabs people Out There and makes them
shake their heads and say, “Well, maybe
the old so-and—so’s right”—-thus is the
monster, Public Opinion, aroused.

The most recent prolonged Pearson-
Anderson campaign has been against

Congressman L. Mendel Rivers, the
South Carolina Democrat who is chair-
man of the House Armed Services Com-
mittee. They dislike Rivers because he is
a segregationist, a reactionary, and a
hawk, but they are attacking him on
another ground: He is, they say, an
alcoholic and therefore a security risk.
Their goal is to force his ouster as
chairman of the Armed Services Com—
mittee. Their'prospects for success do
not seem bright (their ﬁrst attack won
Rivers a standing ovation from his
House colleagues), but Anderson is pro-
ceeding with his accustomed single-
mindedness. “We’re going to get Rivers,”
he tells Congressmen, “and if you sup-
port him, we’ll get you too.”

It is not a threat to be taken lightly.
Pearson has brought about the defeat,
disgrace, or imprisonment of more poli-
ticians than he can remember. His re-
porting on corruption in Huey Long’s
empire sent a governor of Louisiana to
jail in the 1930’s. J. Parnell Thomas,
Republican chairman of the House Un-
American Activities Committee, was
jailed after Pearson revealed in 1948 that
he had extorted kickbacks from members
of his Congressional staff. The Dodd
case was only the latest.

As a rule, Pearson’s exposés are di—
rected at his political Opponents on the
right. (In this he differs from his partner,
Jack Anderson, who has no politics
beyond a vague afﬁnity for the under-
dog, and considers Pearson’s ideology a
nuisance because it limits the number of
politicians he can attack.) One major
exception to this rule came when Pear-
son helped expose Adam Powell’s ﬁnan-
cial misdeeds. The Powell case forced
Pearson to choose between his muck—
racking and his liberalism; he chose the
former, but Powell’s expulsion from the
House caused him no little anguish. Just
before the House vote on POwell, Pear-
son tried to head off expulsion with
several columns that pointed out the
misdeeds of otherCongressmen, but it
was too late.

Pearson can build as well as destroy.
His columns can create what Ralph
Nader calls “an atmosphere of inevi-
tability” for legislation he favors. Be-
sides drumming up public support for
legislation with his columns, he works
behind the scene's on Capitol Hill. Often
he will call key Congressmen to warn
that if they vote the wrong way, he will
be obliged to attack them. His columns
are often timed to coincide with key
votes or committee meetings. Senate

The Truth about Drew Pearson
from page 41

 

insiders give Pearson’s behind—the-scenes
intervention much credit for the pas-
sage of a tough meat—inspection bill, and
for the passage of the provision that
cigarette packages would have to carry
a health warning.

Today, Pearson’s closest allies in Con-
gress are probably Senators Wayne
Morse and Warren Magnuson; most
often, Pearson’s are loose alliances. “He
praised me yesterday,” shrugs one liberal
Congressman, “but it may suit his pur-
poses to attack me tomorrow. How can
I know?” One Senate ﬁgure comments
on the difﬁculties of working with Pear-
son: “You know that when you deal
with Pearson you’re playing with ﬁre.
When you time one of his columns to
inﬂuence a House-Senate conference, for
example, you may be using a bludgeon
on very delicate negotiations. You may
bring some Members around, but you
may stiffen the resistance of others.”

Pearson has as many enemies as allies
on Capitol Hill, and his enemies have
over the years denounced him with unre-
lenting fury. Several hundred of these
castigations have been collected in a
far-right pamphlet titled “Drew Pearson:
All—American Louse”; the most memor-
able of the outcries was by the late
Senator Kenneth McKellar of Tennessee,
who branded Pearson as, among other
things, an infamous liar, a revolving liar,
a pusillanimous liar, a lying ass, a natural-
born liar, a professional liar, a liar for a
living, a liar in the daytime, and a liar at
night.

Pearson, who has rarely received such
serious critical attention, ran McKellar’s
entire speech in his column the next day.

Pearson loves the intrigues and com-
neglected the other end of Pennsyl-

’ vania Avenue; he has been playing the

game of Presidential politics since Her-
bert Hoover’s era.

It was in 1931 that Pearson, already a
prominent Washington correspondent
for the Baltimore Sun, ﬁrst won national
attention by co-authoring (with Robert
S. Allen) a book called Washington
Merry-Go-Rozmd. The book, a hodge-
podge of political gossip, went through
nine printings in two months and was
considered such a rank case of rumor-
mongering it cost both authors their
newspaper jobs. Undaunted, they began
a syndicated column, also called “Wash-
ington Merry-Go-Round.” _

This best-selling book won Pearson
overnight celebrity,ibut it was no ﬂuke,
for Pearson had all his life exhibited the
brains, charm, and audacity of a, young
man with worlds to conquer. He was

at Swarthmore College. He attended
Phillips Exeter and Swarthmore, where
he made Phi Beta Kappa and edited the
school paper. After graduation, Pearson,
a Quaker, spent two years in Europe
with a relief program. He returned to
America in 1921, looked for a newspaper
job, couldn’t ﬁnd one, and so taught
geography for a year at the University
of Pennsylvania. Next, he Used his col-
lege newspaper experience to land a job
covering the 1922 Washington Disarma-
ment Conference for a Collegiate press
association. When the conference ended,
he took off on an around- the- world voy—
age, sending back articles to an Ameri-
can newspaper syndicate. VVhen he re-
turned, the syndicate hired him as a
salesman, and agreed to let him write
some features on the side.

Such was his status in the mid-1920’s—
a kind of Quaker version of Sammy
Glick—when he suddenly advanced his
journalistic career to a new plateau by
marrying Cissy Patterson’s daughter.

Cissy, an heiress to the Chicago Trib—
une empire, and later owner» of the
Washington Times-Herald, was then
Countess Gizycka, divorced from a P0-
lish nobleman, mother of the nineteen-—
year-old” Countess Felicia. Pearson met
Cissy and her daughter while, visiting
friends in Washington in 1924. The
young countess was unimpressed, but her
mother took a shine to Pearson and in-
vited him to visit her ranch in Wyo-
ming. Of the several accounts of Pear—v
son’s subsequent cOurtship with the
Countess Felicia, the best is his own:

“The young Countess Felicia was not
fascinated with me. The more I fell in
love With her, the more bored she be-
came. Finally, in an effort to escape both
me and her mother, she got on her pony,
rode to a railroad station, and caught a
train west. . . . She went to Los Angeles
and I went on peddling syndicated fea-
tures. _

“For many months I did not know
what had become of the girl who was to
become my wife. Nor did her mother.
Then Felicia wrote me from San Diego,
where she had a job as a waitress. In the
spring of 1925 I went there and we
were married.”

The marriage ended a few years later
in a highly publicized divorce (“There
in ﬂaming headlines, for all the world
to see, was the story of my attempted
happiness—and how it had ended in
failure”), but Pearson in the meantime
had risen to the top level of Washing-
ton journalism.

Franklin Roosevelt became President
just a few months after Pearson and
Allen began their column, and the col;
umn’s salacious style was well suited to
the intrigues and ﬂamboyance of the
New Deal. Roosevelt once called Pearson

a“chronic liar” for attacking Secretary
:f State Cordell Hull, but fo1 the most
part FDR and the columnist got on well,
and Pearson backed Roosevelt’s policies
down the line. (continued)

Pearson cared much less for Harry
Truman. He believes the Cold War re-
sulted in large part because an inexperi-
enced Truman let himself be talked into
an overly hostile anti-Soviet policy by
Secretary of Defense James Forrestal.
Pearson’s dislike of Forrestal led to one
of the low points of his career. After
Mrs. Forrestal was robbed in front of
her home, Pearson printed a version of
the incident in which Forrestal ﬂed from
the robbery scene. Then Pearson de-
clared: “A man who runs out the back
door of his house into the alley, leaving
his wife to cope with a jewel robbery
alone, would not appear to have the
courage or chivalry to be the best sec-
retary of national defense.” The ac—
cepted version of the incident was that
F orrestal was inside the house and un—
aware it was happening. Pearson later
wrote of Forrestal’s suicide:

“My greatest depression occurred
when James Forrestal, after resigning as
Secretary of Defense, threw himself out
of a window in the Bethesda Naval Hos—
pital—and a chorus of critics blamed me
for his death. I won’t dwell on the

tragedy, except to say that after it hap-

pened there were awful moments when
I woke up in the night ﬁghting back an
almost paralyzing urge to join Forrestal.”

It is characteristic of Pearson thus to
turn his expression of regret into an oc—
casion for self—dramatization.

Pearson was one of the few national
journalists who didn’t like Ike, and the
feeling was mutual. During the 1952
campaign he wrote so extensively of the
Nixon “slush fund” that numerOus pro-
Eisenhower papers dropped his column.
His columns did much to force Sherman
Adams’ resignation and to kill the con—
troversial Dixon-Yates private power
contract. Eisenhower would declare in
later years: “I don’t read any newspaper
I consider irresponsible, and I consider
any newspaper that carries Pearson’s
column to be irresponsible.”

Pearson admired John Kennedy and
for the most part treated him generously.
He criticized Mrs. Kennedy for not
visiting his favorite Washington orphan-
age (she ﬁnally did); he never cared for
Robert Kennedy; and he deplored the
frequent conservatism of the President’s
friends and policies. But when Kennedy
was killed, Pearson wrote: “He was one
of the rare combinations of youth, Wis—
dom, devotion, gaiety, and humor. .
He would have become one of our great
Presidents.”

Pearson had known Lyndon Johnson
for many years, and during Johnson’s
ﬁrst days in the White House, the col—
umnist speculated ~on the sort of Presi- .
dent he might make. He conceded John- f.
son’s knowledge of the governmental '
process, but warned that LBJ “is not
versed in the immediate background of .
peace, nor temperamentally suited to
conduct delicate diplomatic negotia-
tions.” He added that Johnson has “a

 




 

 

 

 

  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  

   

l. slight Texas chip on his shoulder when it

comes to foreign affairs” and a “natural
Texas impulse to wave the ﬂag.”

Truer words were rarely written, but
this was almost the last time Pearson
wrote with candor or perception about
Johnson. Soon he became a White House
apologist to a degree perhaps exceeded
only by William S. White.

Like most liberals, Pearson admires
Johnson’s domestic goals and the skill
with which he has achieved many of
these goals. Pearson’s anguish has come
over Vietnam, but despite his deep con-
cern about the war, he has rarely criti-
cized it, and never put the blame for it
on Johnson himself. He says he has not
criticized Johnson because he has no
alternative—no “way out”—to suggest.
When various “ways out” are put forth,
Pearson throws up his hands. The Presi—
dent is learning, he says; we must give
him time.

Meanwhile, ignoring Vietnam, Pearson
regularly credits LBJ with a diplomatic
ﬁnesse that eludes other students of in-
ternational affairs. He declared that at
the Glassboro Conference, which most
observers viewed as a minor farce,
“Johnson did an excellent job” and “con-
vinced Kosygin that the U. S. really
wants peace.” He announced that the
Pan-American summit conference was
“a much greater triumph for Lyndon
Johnson than appeared in the press.” He
credits Johnson with “boldly” seeking
peace with China (by bombing her
borders?), and .so on, and so forth.
When he is not praising Johnson’s diplo-
matic skill, he is likely to be lauding his
warm, humble, human qualities, or pass-
ing on such tidbits as that the President’s
grandson never cries except when his
diaper needs changing. .

A couple of days after Johnson’s
March 31 announcement that he would
not seek the Presidency again, Pearson
informed his readers that (1) he had
been expecting it all along and (2) the
writers who were interpreting the Presi—
dent’s move as “a surrender to the po-
litical polls Where he was licked” were
wrong, for Johnson “was making a great
sacriﬁce, with the country’s unity in his
heart.” Moreover, Pearson advanced a
novel explanation for the President’s
stepping down: It was largely because his
one-time protégé Bill Moyers had
deserted him. “The President has no sons,
and to some extent, Bill Moyers occupied
a son’s place withhim. . . . Moyers
wanted to be Undersecretary of State
when George Ball retired, and the Presi-
dent wouldn’t go for that. . . . At about
that time, Moyers had become intimate
with Bobby Kennedy. . . . It was Bobby
who got Moyers his new post with
Newsday. . . . From his sickbed, he
[Johnson] watched, on three TV sets
placed in his bedroom, Bill MOyers’ pub-

lic statement of resignation. You could
tell it hurt him.”

This touching, but incredible, explana-
tion of Johnson’s retirement parrots the

anti-Moyers line put forth fOr many
months by Marvin Watson, George
Reedy, and other Johnsonites who have
long envied and resented Moyers. A
great deal of Pearson’s recent reporting
on White House affairs has seemed to
come from such sources.

It was not always so. In the 1950’s
Pearson delighted in twitting Johnson’s
vanity and exposing his under-the-table
political deals. A typical column de-
clared: “The reason Lyndon Johnson
ducked the McCarthy issue was that
Texas oilmen were heavily behind Mc-
Carthy. Lyndon feared they might put a
candidate in the race against him if he
bucked McCarthy. . . . It was this evasion
that helped win for the Senator the
nickname of ‘Lyin’-Down’ Johnson.”

The 1959 Pearson-Johnson pact (the
Lewis Strauss deal) had fallen through
by January 1961, and Pearson revived
the soft-on-McCarthy charge against the
new Vice President. But four years later,
when LBJ was inaugurated as President
in his own right, Pearson recanted:
“Looking back on it,” he wrote, “John—
son was canny to bide his time on Mc-
Carthy. There’s a saying in the news-
paper profession that a war correspondent
must live to tell his story. And, in poli-
tics, a Senator has to be reelected to be
able to vote.”

Several theories are advanced to ex-
plain Pearson’s conversion from critic to
disciple of Johnson. (Pearson’s own, of
course, is that Johnson underwent a
transformation from the evasive wheeler-
dealer of the 1950’s to the wise and
warm—hearted statesman of today.) Some
observers suggest that Pearson has simply
let himself become too personally en-
tangled with Johnson. One of Pearson’s
grandsons is named for LBJ; his stepson,
Tyler Abell, Was for several years an
Assistant Postmaster General; Abell’s
wife, Bess, is Mrs. Johnson’s social sec-
retary.

Yet these entanglements are probably
symptoms of the problem rather than its
cause. He is seventy years old, he has
begun to mellow, and he is susceptible to
the ﬂattery Johnson will now and then
lavish upon him. One member of the
White House staff, speaking with the
cool cynicism that beﬁts his post, says
of Pearson:

“One Visit here supplies him with
enough tidbits for four months, so he
doesn’t have to come often. Every now
and then, to show he’s not ‘in,’ he writes
a critical piece. But the President under—
stands that is how the game is played,
and he will tolerate Pearson doing so
far more than anyone else, because, he

says, ‘Pearson has seven hundred papers r.

and they’re papers that people read.’ I
don’t think he has any personal fondness
for Pearson, just knows a safe leak when
he sees one.”

earson’s career is nearing its end. In
the next few years he hopes to phase;
out of the daily column and devote

4 .. most of his time to writing books. Jack
Anderson will carry on the muckraking,
but Pearson’s special role of muckraker/
crusader may never again be ﬁlled. Like
Luce, like Hearst, like Pulitzer, he was
an original. ‘

Whatever his lapses in recent years——
and if he has been soft on Johnson, he
has also been very strong on consumer
issues, and on Dodd and Rivers, and civil
rights—Pearson deserves to be judged
on his complete record.

By sheer force of personality, he made
himself an important political force in
the nation’s greatest period of growth
and change. Certainly it is difficult to
measure Pearson’s precise impact, for
social progress comes about in America
only after a mingling of forces so com;
plex that, while we hail the idea whose
time has come, we are rarely sure just
who or what made it come.

Nonetheless, in any period of progress,
the contributions of a few individuals
can be singled out. Presidents, ob—
viously, have the greatest opportunity

,. to advance the public interest, as Roose-

l velt and Johnson did in domestic affairs.

A few inspired bureaucrats, with Presi-

dential support, have made major con-

tributions: Rexford Tugwell and Harry

Hopkins in the 1930’s; Bill Moyers in

1964-66. In Congress, the crusading of

Kefauver and Douglas was outstanding

in recent years. Now and then an out-

sider, a gadﬂy like Upton Sinclair, can
speed the political process by arousing
public opinion.

Pearson deserves to be considered in
this small circle of effective reformers.
Among journalists, probably only Walter
Lippmann has done as much to advance
progressive causes. They make quite a
team: Lippmann the oracle, Pearson the
gut-ﬁghter, Lippmann taking the high

road, Pearson the low.

But Pearson had set for himself a
special role. He began with the vanity,
the ambition, the common touch of a
p01itician, and he saw that the kind of
power he wanted could only be built on
mass appeal—on compromise, on ambi-
guity, on Showmanship. He has wielded
vast power, and most often to good ends;
if he has sometimes been wrong he has
more times been right. He has never
been fashionable, never much appreciated
by more sophisticated liberals, but he has
passed the tests of time and popular ac-
ceptance that, in a democracy, should
not and cannot be scorned. Norman
Mailer has correctly said that all writers
are secretly running for President, and
Pearson, with his six hundred papers and
his forty million readers, has been leading
the race for a long time. Pearson once
suggested he should have inscribed on-
his tombstone: “Here Lies Drew Pear-
= son, S.O.B.” That’s fair enough, but he
' could add in the small print that he was
an S.O.B. who gave America’s newspaper
readers most of what they wanted and
perhaps a little more than they de-
served. El

What Washington Thought; .
before the Riots from page 48

 

Conversations With
the Middle Class (continued)

up with the political news, “the answer
is very simple. People must learn to re-
spect one another as human beings. I’ve
worked around Negroes all my life and
that’s the solution. I don’t mean people
should be hypocritical about it, though;
now, one time a Negro girl worked in
my ofﬁce who was simply no good as a
human being. She was a horrible person,
as a person; no one in the world could
have gotten along with her. With only
two people in'thatoﬂice, I don’t see why
they had to make one of them a Negro
anyhow.” Such innocently racist remarks
were typical of a number of people who,
without convictions one way or another,
were probably not so much racist as
merely out—of-date.

The majority of Washington outside
the ghetto, however, sounded liberal and
were pleased to describe themselves as
liberal. At the beginning of spring there
was a well-mannered calm to the way
people spoke of race riots; only the war
and the Presidential elections appeared to
be occasions for real distress.

There were several evident reasons for
the calm, apart from the pleasantness of
the spring and the usual prosperity. The
most evident was that middle-class
Washingtonians neither saw nor felt
strongly the tensions of the ghettos. Oc-
casionally, people were explicit about
this: “Frankly, I’m more concerned
about other things, like I guess the war,”
said a civil servant who lived in the reno-

vated part of Capitol Hill and was lunch-
ing with his wife in Lafayette Square,
“than I am about race relations. After all,
the race problem doesn’t directly affect
me.” Other times people responded so
perfunctorily as to make the same point,
like the George Washington University
junior, browsing in a bookstore on
Pennsylvania Avenue, who said he was
mostly interested in his studies (he was
a history major), “but I would say that
I sympathize with Negro goals and
would deeply regret racial disorder,
which could have an adverse effect.”
The prevailing opinion, in both white
and Negro middle-class sections of town,
was that there might be no riot this year
in Washington since, as it was typically
put, “the Negroes here are too well-off.
They have too much to lose.” A young
Negro who lives on Eighth Street down-
town and is planning to go to college

in Baltimore next year, doubted there '
could be riots “because the people are f

too intellectual and there’s not much‘
ghetto.” A Negro housewife on Arkan- '_
sas Avenue in upper Northwest likewise .

claimed that “the Negro community is
.making too much progress, and it’s too

People Who Care

By now all involved in the pet
industry have no doubt heard of
the Federal Laboratory Animal
Welfare Act which is designed to
improve conditions for research
animals and discourage theft of
pets.

While this law has been suc-
cessful in curbing much‘ of-the
abusive treatment to animals that
we all abhor, more needs to be
done.

Standards of care for animals
need to be established in such
areas as pounds, shelters, pet

shops and further regulations on

wardens and dealers, not subject
to the federal statute, are needed.
Through enactment in each state
of laws supporting the federal
act, this can be accomplished.
The U.S_. Animal Health Associa-
tion has designed the “Model
State Law” which will fill-the
need as follows: 7

1. Establish standards of care for
dogs in pet shops, ' municipal
pounds and humane society shel-
ters.

2. Regulate dog dealers and dog
wardens.

3. Discourage theft of pets by
dissociating impoundment and
disposition authority.

4. Assure that fees paid for re-
demption or sale of impounded
dogs and cats be paid to the mu-
nicipality or the humane society.
5. Provide for licensing or regis-

KENNEL MANAGEMENT

tration of‘ people and agencies
which handle small animals in
quantity or for commercial pur-
poses.

6. Offer uniformity of definition
and approach to animal welfare
problems at state and- federal
levels. .

The Council of State Govern-
ment's approvedthe model law,
and it is available for presentation
to all state governments by in—
terested groups or individuals.

It is now up to “people who
care” to get the ball rolling.
What better place to look for
“people who care” than amoung
the professionals of the pet in-
dustry - you the kennel operators,
veterinarians and handlers.

By presenting the model law
to your state governments for
adoption, the lot of the pets in
our country can be on the road
to, improvement.

Perhaps your breed club would

organiZe such a presentation or a

group of local kennel operators
and veterinarians could be assem-
bled for this purpose. Remember,
you can act on your own as well.
The implement is available for
us to stop further abuses to ani-
mals, will we supply the action
needed?

tion, New York, N. Y. 10017 for

THE MATURING
AGGRESSIVE DOG

Many people who buy dogs be-
come quite unhappy when their
loving puppy starts to become
aggressive at 10 or 12 months of
age. They sometimes feel that as
the dog gets older, he will out-
grow this a gressive behavior pat-
tern. But t e truth of the matter
is that the dog will become more
aggressive. Why take such a pessi-
mistic attitude? Why should the
dog become more aggressive? Do
you mean he will become more
aggressive until he dies?

No, this is not a pessimistic atti-
tude, but a realistic attitude. The
reason a dog becomes aggressive
is the changing of the chemical
structure in the dog’s body as he
attains puberty. When he reaches
his full growth in sexual maturi-
ty, we generally see a leveling
off in the aggressive growth rate.
Small dogs reach sexual maturity
at a younger age, but let’s dis-
cuss our larger dogs, where most
of the problems exist. Such dogs
as those in the 80 lb. weight
range reach maturity at about 18
months of age. As the dog gets
older, more male hormones enter
the system and change the hor-
mone balance. In human beings
you see the secondary sex charac-
teristics developing in young teen-
a er males and females. This
c ange in the hormone structure
of the body also affects person-

18

Capt. Arthur J. Haggerty
of Capt. Haggerty’s School for Dogs

ality in teenagers with varying
results. It is wrong to e uate a
young dog to a teenage uman
being. The psychological prob-
lems that beset a human are a
million-fold greater than those
in which dogs are involved. With
the dog, we have a fairly simple
change in the chemical structure
of the body.

The breeds that generally come
to mind in this 18-month ma-
turity pattern are the German
Shepherd and Doberman Pin-
scher, which over the years have
been bred to be protective and be
excellent guard dogs. Many of
our giant breeds such as Great
Dane, St. Bernard, Mastiff, etc.,
mature at an even later date
(approx. 21/2 years of age).

There is nothing wrong with a
German Shepherd that has a
moderate amount of protective-
ness in him; a desire to protect
the members of his household.
The problem arises when the dog
becomes too protective. Any dog
that at 6 months of age shows
extreme signs of protection or
aggressiveness is a dog that is
going to be extremely difficult to
handle. Six months of age is too
young for a dog to manifest
these signs. If we are talking
about our 80 lb. dog which ma-
tures at 18 months, we have 12
more months in which increas-

PETATURTLES can be dan-
gerous because they can
cause gastrointestinal ill-
ness. Many parents mistake
it for flu. The Food and Drug
Administration is consider-
ing banning sale of small pet
turtles; For several years all
turtlestshipped in interstate
commerce have had to be
tested and certified free of
salmonella and Arizona or-
ganism. The FDA has evid-
ence, that the certification
requirement has limited ef-
fectiveness \in preventing
contaminated turtles from
reaching buyers. A survey
showed, that 54 per cent of the
turtles. were contaminated
when retestr fter certifica-
tion. One 5. , of salmonel-

losis showed that 14 per cent'

of all cases were turtle-asso-
ciated;

The ban on turtle sales is
supported by the Animal
Welfare Institute, which em-
phasized that small turtles

The FDA is also studying
an alternative proposal that
would improve the certifica-

requirements on the sale of
turtles. According to this pro-
posal all retail displays of
turtles would have to have
prominent Warning signs. A

Those who have pet turtles »

now might want to take the
precautions in the FDA pro-
posed handling instructions,
which follow:

 

(Wash hands throughly af-

. ter handling turtles or any

water or object that has been
in contact with the-turtle.

(2) Keep turtles, the turtle
bowl, and turtle water away
from .food, from food prepa-
ration utensils and from
places where foods are pre:
pared. Do not clean turtle
bowl in the kitchen sink or in
other areas where food prep-
aration utensils may become
contaminated.

(3) Clean the turtle bowl
with a strong cleaning solu-
tion and sanitize with a
household disinfectant after
cleaning.

\ (4) Warn children about the
dangers of touching their

faces, foods or other objects
after handling turtles, the
turtle bowl or the turtle wa-
ter.

causes of Salmonella. Manda-

are the chief, problems now.

bacteria, but cooking meat or

WASHINGTON (AP) —
Those cute little pet turtles
may be hazardous to your
health. And you may be to
theirs as well.

So. the Food and Drug
Administration is taking steps 1
to either ban or rigidly curtail
turtle sales and shipments
throughout the country.

The agency detailed both al~
ternatives in the Federal _
Register Tuesday and asked
for public comments by July
29.

According to recent esti-
mates, pet turtles annually
transmit salmonella poisoning
to about 280,000 Americans,
mostly young children. The ill-
ness is marked by abdominal
pain, nausea, fever and
diarrhea but rarely is fatal.

Consumers Union petitioned
for a total turtle ban last De-
cember in the interest of
public health, charging that
the FDA’s 1972 attempt at
controlling the problem had
been a “dramatic and
‘ demOnstrable” failure.

The Humane Society of the

United States and the Animal
Welfare Institute joined in the
move, pleading the cause of
humanity to turtles.
/ They said that most turtles
sold in pet stores are not min-
iatures but rather baby red-
eared sliders, which “under
proper care” could live 40
years in captivity but which
generally die within four to six
months.

However. in proposing an;

FDA Commissioner Alexa-9

ther ban or rigidly Cw‘tail turtle
sales and shipments throughout
the country.

The agency detailed both a1-
ternatives in the Federal Regis-
ter‘Tuesday and asked for pub-
lic. comments by July 29.

According to recent esti-
mates. pet turtles annually
transmit salmonella poisoning
to about 280,000 Americans,
mostly young children. The ill-
ness is marked by abdominal
pain. nausea. fever and
diarrhea but. rarely is fatal.

Consumers Union petitioned
for a total turtle ban last De-
cember in the interest of public
health. charging that the FDA's
1972 attempt at controlling the
problem had been a “dramatic
and demonstrable“ failure.

The Humane Society of the
United States and ”19%
Welfare I’LELLMF joined in
mov e p eading the cause of hu-
manity to turtles.

They said that most turtles
sold in pet stores are not
miniatures but rather baby
red-eared sliders. which “under
proper care" could live 40 years
in captivity but which generally
die within four to six months.

them, and she makes war against

They are the unscrupulous “pet

available so ur ce 7—- including dog
thieves, in some cases -— and sell the
animals to research laboratories for

will and simply take
any dogs he wanted
to fill his orders."

ing in Michigan’s Humane Slaugh-.

ter ' Law was amOng the first such
state laws in the nation.

Another fight for animals —- and
Michigan’ 5 taxpayers —-— that Mrs.
Dyce helped win was the 1965 abol-
ishment of the state’s “bounty sys-

tem” on foxes, bobcats, and coyotes. .

Most bounty hunters left their traps

, unattendcd’for days and weeks, while .

the painfully unprlsoncd animals
died slow deaths from starvation

and thirst. In the Spring each year

the fox holes would be dug out, the
pups clubbed to death for the $5
bounty, and the mothers left living
so they could reproduce more pups
for the next year’s slaughter. Many
hunters brought dead coyotes in from
Wisconsin across the upper penin-
sula to collect the bounties. In 1964

‘ the state had paid out a $250, 000

to the bounty hunters. The law for
which Mrs.D Dcyce fought stepped the
slaughter CO] 111 its tracks -- and
the outflow of tax donars.

It Was largely due to Mrs. Dyce’s

efforts that Michigan became the

first state in the nation to have a
law requiring licensing and regula-
tion of dealers selling dogs and cats
to research institutions and labora-

tories. She and Dr. Robert Willsonv

of the City of Detroit Public Health
Service wrote the bill.

Once, Mrs. Dyce heard a dOg deal-
er brag, “The dog dealing business
is the third biggest business in the
Midwest.” Earlier, one of his drivers
had been arrested and convicted on
cruelty-to-animals Charges; he had
jammed 49 dogs into a 1952 CheVro-
let 2- door sedan; 33 were in wired-
shut crates behind the front seat and
16in a crate in the trunk. Three
of the dogs were dead.

“orders.” It is likely that many dogs
have been taken before. their owners
had a chance to claim them. '

At Presbyterian-St. Luke’s Hospi-
tal in Chicago, she saw dogs which
had just come in from a dealer.
They were housed in small metal
cages in one room, and most of
the dogs Were dirty, frightened, and
emaciated. All of them had distem-
per. At Northwestern University’s
School of Medicine, the dogs were
in the same deplorable condition.
Both of the laboratories got the ani-
mals from the Hargroves in Tennes-
see, whom Mrs. Dyce has since
brought to justice.

A_ Trade Day at Ripley, Miss.
involved roughly a thousand dogs,
many of them stolen, according to a
reporter for the Memphis, Tenn.,
Press-Scimitar. The, article revealed
in word and picture how the dogs
were beaten, kicked, and prodded
with metal poles into the deg dealer
trucks. It was described as, “. . . a
nightmare of man’s cruelty to living,
sentient creatures . . ."

Mrs. Dyce says: “The survivors of
these Trade Day brutalities are then

 

farms where they await delivery to
a research laboratory. Is it any won-

and frightened and not fit subjects
for scientific researchP”.

In testimony before the US. Sen-
ate Commerce Committee, Mrs. Dyce
pointed out that Northwestern Uni-

Right to lobby important
to maintaining democracy

If you mention the word “lobbyist” to
most people, they have an image of
some shifty-eyed pol with baggy pants
and dollar bills sticking out of his back
pocket. As a result of regulation of
lobbying activity and increased public

concern, that stereotype no longer

exists —— if it ever did.

In fact, representatives of
organizations from the Animal Welfare
Institute to Zero Population Growth
play” an important role in the legislative
process by serving as a link between
constituents andqtheir elected officials.
Even individuahcitizens who attempt
to inﬂuence the legislative process
could be considered lobbyists.

Lobbyists can work for any group or
cause which is affected by legislation.
Commonly lobbyists represent com-
mercial and industrial interests, labor
unions, ethnic ' and racial groups,
professional organizations, citizen
groups and foreign interests.

The difficulty rises when lobbyists
strongly pressure officials for the
selfish gain of a few. However, in many
cases, lobbyists are working to achieve
an ideological goal or to promote what
a group believes is in the national in-
terest.

The right of citizens to lobby is a,

firmly grounded American tradition.
The Constitution specifically
guarantees the right of the people “to
petition the government for redress of
grievances ” Founding father James
. Madison went even further. Writing in
“The Federalist,” he said that the
proliferation of opposing factions
would further the cause of democracy.

Special interests were represented at
the First Continental Congress, but it
wasn’t until the 18305 that the word
“lobbyist” became widely used in
Washington.

Then as now, large numbers of
lobbyists pushedlegislation to benefit
farmers, workers, business executives
and other economic or social interests.

As the government expanded an-
laws were passed on an increasin
range of subjects, the number of lob
byists and their causes also expanded
When America became the dominan
force in world leadership after Worl
War II, lobbying by foreign govern
ments or Americans with an interest i
foreign affairs increased substantially.
Another kind of lobbying group whic
has proliferated recently is the publi
interest group. These represent a
range of economic, consumer, en-
vironmental, legal. and social policy
issues. The League of Women Voters is
one of the oldest of the groups, while
Public Citizen, a group founded by
Ralph Nadar, is an example of a new
public interest organization.

To prevent lobbyists from exerting
undue pressure to benefit a few at the
expense of the national interest,
Congress approved laws to regulate
lobbying activities. The most import-
ant of these, the Federal Regulation of
Lobbying Act, was passed in 1946. It
requires paid lobbyists to file quarterly
reports of the money they spend in-
fluencing legislation.

However, laws making additional
reforms of campaign spending should
be passed to add further protection
against special interest legislation.

The role of the lobbyist continues to
change. With the tremendous increases
in communications technology, it is
easier for government ofﬁcials to stay
in close touch with constituents. This
means that more people can get
directly involved with the legislative
process.

If this trend continues, government
could approach the ultimate in
representative democracy where each
citizen would be his own lobbyist, and
government decisions will be decided
on the basis of a true national majority

' opinion.

 

Tom Hall is the us. representative from
the 3rd Congressional District.

The battle was joined on July 17
when the Air Force, with obviou s
pride in its scientific leadership, an-
nounced a million-dollar research pro-
grain, The program was intended to
determine the precise effects of brea-
thing various poisonous fumes now
contaminating the nation’s atmos-
phere. ‘

To accomplish this. the announce.

ment said. a group of 200 pure-bred
beagle pups would be exposed to the
fumes under controlled conditions at
the Aerosphere Medical R e s e a r c h
Laboratory; located in Ohio’s Wright
Patterson Air Force Base.

The Air Force stressed that the ani-
mals scheduled to die for the benefit of
humanity would not be subjected to
any unnatural poisonous gases or con-
coctions intended for military pur-
poses. On the other hand, it admitted,
the friendly animals would be “de-
barked” in advance to avoid the clinic
distraction of whimpering and yelping.

Rep. Aspin immediately protested
the undertaking, describing it with
such words as “excessive,” “uncon~
scionable.” and “obscene.” His at-
tack, despite the relatively small news

uppies

space it received, struck a responsive

chord in animal lovers from coast to
coast. Thus far the Air Force remains
adamant in its plans to go ahead.

The situation points up the continu-
ing argument between researchers
and antivivisecti’onists, who for years
have been complaining about the lack
of. controls over experiments on ani-
mals. According to the researchers,
death'of the animals is necessary to
help human existence; the protesters
claim unnecessary cruelty and offer
statistics in proof.

In the U.S.. in 1971. figures of the
Animal Welfare Institute show that
some 500.000 dogs and 200.000 cats

were destroyed in l a b o r a t o r y re- .

Turtles may behazard to health

By JOHN STOWELL

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) ——
Those cute little pet turtles
may be hazardous to your
health. And you may be to
theirs as well. .

So the Food and. Drug Ad-

ministration is taking steps to
either ban or rigidly curtail
turtle sales and shipments
throughout the country.
' The agency detailed both
alternatives in the Federal
Register Tuesday and asked
for public comments by July
29. ,

According to recent esti-
mates, pet turtles annually

transmit salmonella poisoning
r .

 

f

to about zaomo Americans,
mostly young children. The
illness is marked by ab-
dominal pain, nausea, fever
and diarrhea but rarely is
fatal.

CONSUMERS Union peti-.

tioned for a total turtle ban

last December in-the interest»

of public health, charging that
the FDA’s 1972 attempt at
controlling the problem had
been a “dramatic and demon-
strable” failure.

The Humane Society of the

United States and the ML

Welfarg‘ilnstdqtute joined in the
move peadmg the cause of
humanity to turtles.

They said that most turtles
sold in pet stores are not
miniatures but rather baby
redeared sliders, which “un-
der proper care” could live 40
years in captivity but which
generally die within four to
six months.

HOWEVER, in proposing an
alternative to an outright ban,
FDA Commissioner Alex-

ander M. Schmidt expressed »

the belief that more rigid
testing, certification and
labeling would be “cum-
bersome and unlikely to be
completely effective.”

He noted that ’a 12-month
survey last year by the US.

Center for Disease Control
found '54 per cent of all
supposedly disease-free
turtles to be carrying
salmonella sometime after
certifiCation.

THE NEW PLAN would
require more sensitive meth:
ods of testing for salmonella
organisms, provide federal
funds for state. certification
programs and require warn-
ing signs in pet stores and
warning leaﬂets distributed to
each and every new pet turtle
owner.

How does man share earth with ‘fellow. creatures"?

Much of the anguish
- is found unnecessary

By Clive Lawranoe
Staff writer of
The Christian Science Monitor

;. All over the world, every minute of
the day, countless animals are suffer-
ing untold pain and anguish at the
hands of man.

Almost all of this suffering, say
animal protection societies, is unnec-
essary. It is the result of vanity,
callousness, laziness, custom, and
lack of education, they say.

Suffering is caused, societies say,
as:

0 Animals are trapped in the steel
jaws of leg-hold traps, or jerked into
the air by one leg, to provide furs.

o Whales are killed by harpoons
carrying explosive charges.

0 Slaughterhouses fail to use hu-
mane stunning methods, but string
animals up before killing.

0 Domesticated, animals are
jammed into tiny, airless boxes for
transportation»; they are poorly fed
and roughly treated.

’0 Wild animals are badly trans-
ported to zoos and parks.

0 Animals are used for scientific
,, ' his.

Growing numbers of Americans
feel that their nation has to reassess
its attitude toward animals; they say
that having “dominion over the
beasts of the fields” does not mean
they can be tortured at will.

Cleveland Amory, head of the Fund
for Animals, epitomizes this growing
attitude by saying, “Animals were not
put here simply to amuse, use, or
abuse. They were not put here just to
eat, to wear, or to profit from in any
way. They are wonderful fellow
creatures with whom we are lucky
enough to share the earth.”

TRAPPING:

The Fund for Animals estimates
that 25 million wild animals are
trapped in the United States and
Canada alone every year. Two out of
every three are of no use to the
trapper. They are called “trash,” he
says, and include birds and domestic
animals.~ ‘

"Cruelty to animals: protests rise

1

‘ Continued from Page 1
“It is sometimes said that wildlife is
‘ cruel, and that the animals die a
.painful death anyway, by the teeth
and claws of predators,” former

. Canadian trapper Frank Conibear ’
.1 has written. “But the sufferings occa--
stoned by the common steel trap are ‘

‘inconceivably greater.” _ .

This concern led Mr. Conibear to
experiment for 12 years before per-

fecting , a trap that kills in-
stantaneously. The Conibear trap has"
been on the market since 1958, and
other “instant-kill traps” have sub-
sequently appeared, but the vast
majOrity of trappers are still said to
be usingthe 200-year-old painful leg-
hold.

The Conibear trap can be obtained
' free. ,

Since 1961 the Canadian Association
for Humane Trapping (CAHT), with
the Canadian provincial wildlife ser-
vices, has given away 7,000 Conibear
traps in exchange for leg-hold traps.

Mr. Amory tries to get trappers to
switch to' the Conibear trap (which is
, more difficult to handle than/the leg-
, old.types). Failing that, he works for

legislation to outlaw the leg-hold,

type, whichis already illegal in more
than a doZen countries including En-
gland, West Germany, and Kenya. A
year ago the Florida Fish and Game
Commission banned it as “barbaric. ”

The “springpole trap” jerks the
animal into the air by one leg. And
Christine Stevens, writing in “An-
imals and their Legal Rights,” calls
explosive harpoons a “hideously cruel
. method” of killing whales

The International Society for the
Protection of Animals (ISPA) reports
that while the importance of trapping
to Canada’s economy has dwindled, it
still “represents a colOssal harvest of
animal‘sufferin g. ’ ’

Most humane societies are against
trapping of fur‘ animals. Jacquie
Collins of Beauty Without Cruelty in
New York points out that “fake furs”
are far cheaper, just as warm, and
immune to moths.’

: However, many societies are pre-
pared. to Compromise With the fur
industry if.~.unnecessary suffering of

animals through painful traps is
eliminated.

SLAUGHTERING: ,
”Speaking, at a recent ISPA confer-
ence, British veterianarian H. E.
Bywater said, “ . . . probably the
greatest source of preventable animal
sufferingis amongst animals the ﬂesh
of which is used for human food.”

Every year about half a ' billion
animals, and 4% billion poultry around
the world are slaughtered for human
consumption. According to ISPA esti-

mates, only 11 percent are affected by ~

humane slaughter laws. .

. For almost 14 years the United
States has had a humane slaughter

bill (as haVe many other countries) .

but 20 percent of the country’ s s1augh--
terhouses are not affected by it: This
includes “kosher killing” — to comply

with Department of Agriculture sani- .

tary . regulations, the cut surface of
the animal may not touch the floor;
animals must be first strung up by
their legs, often resulting in broken
legs or a split pelvis.

Conditions in South America and _
'many developing countries are re-

portedly far more crude.

John Walsh, Boton-baSed field offi-'
cer of the ISPA, tries to persuade
other countries to adopt humane
stunning deVices.

Some progress is being made. Ar-
gentine, for example, has passed
humane- slaughter legislation.
long ago ISPA negotiated with thé
Greek Government to have 400 veter-
inary stations responsible for animal
welfare throughout the country.

TRANSPORTATION .

In Mexico City, says Mr. Walsh,
everymonth an average of 50 calves
arrive dead at a slaughterhouse.
Slaughter , animals are brutally
hoisted out of ship’s holds by ropes
tied around their horns. Sometimes
their horns break and they crash to
the deck.

Some countries have legislation

governing the humane transport of.-

animals — but many do not. . .
As for Wild animals destined for pet

shops, research institutes, and zoos, ; , ‘p
75 percent ofallKWild animals and, . .

Not"

birds coming into the U. S. alone are

dead on arrival, according to the“
Fund for Animals. That is 24 million

every year.

At Heathrow Airport, London,- a few,

years ago the RSPCA established a "
hostel for animals. The hostelhandles ‘

80, 000 creatures every month.

The ISPA claims: “Dangers can be ‘

reduced if not eliminated altogether
by shipping agencies adopting the

provisions laid down in the ‘Manuai ,3
far the Transportation of Live An
imals by Air’ issued by the hiter~~‘f~

national Air Transport Association. ”

By Mary B. Davis
EULOGY FOR BROWNIE
“Driver, were you so
unaware, in rushing blindly to
your goal? Could you not feel
the thunder the re -- the thud
of a snuffed out.canine soul?”
From a poem by Deborah E.
Katz, whose words kept running
through my mind as I listened to;
Toni and Terri Starkey tell how
their pet Collie was killed on
Friday, February 25, 1972, by a
speeding car -- “AND THEY
DIDN’T EVEN STOP! ! ” the little
girls kept repeating.
Driver, were you too wrapped
in your own selfish thoughts
to take a few minutes to con-'
sole ‘hu rt youngsters, and maybe
‘help - the dog? Maybe you didn’t
hear the “thud,” but there is

no doubt that you heard the
horrified girls as the scream-

ed “Mother, Mother, Mother!!”
while ; rushing to. the side of
their dying pet. One quick
glance in your rearview mirror
would have given you a glimpse
of a heartbreaking sight: be-
wildered, grieving children hov-‘
ering over
dog, h0ping somehow, someone
would arrive in time to save
it! .
For drivers without a con-
science, some states have laws!
requiring motorists to stop and
give assistance and notin own-
ers, if known; police; and the
closest humane society or ani-'
mal rescue league -- also giving
the motorist’s full identification
and the exact location of the in-
jured animal -- cat, dag, horse,
or cattle! Fines and jail sen-
tences are imposed for failure
to obey. this law. - “Animals
and Their Legal Rights” con-

-tains detailed information con-
cerning laws to protectanimals.

cousins, Pam and Debra, who
live near Iuka with their par-
ents, Mr. and Mrs. James Bay
Page. Young as he is, little
Richard is already feeding a
stray cat that comes to his
house -- and when it doesn’t
show up when he thinks it should,
he wants to know. where it is!
Pam and Debra also like ani-
mals and have a Dachshund.

Toni and Terri’s father was at
work, but their mother, Mrs.

  

' James (Linda) Starkey lost no

time in getting to her children.
Because the dog’s eyes were
open, the youngsters

was really dead, still hoping that
he would get up and go on home,
as he had Once done after being
hit by a car. But as gently as
such things can be eXplained to
children, Linda Starkey finally

convinced them“ that “Podch”

year-old Toni had seemed

. mostly concerned about his

knocked-out teeth. Suddenly,
she burst into sobs. Like ten-
year-old Terri, Toni, tea, now
understood that Brownie would
never go home again. ,
At this point in the story, I

couldn’t help thinking: When a.

“believer” in the Almighty

does he explain his cold indif-

children’s feelings by handling

wrapping him carefully in a
blanket, placing him gentlyin his
sleeping box, and taking 'himtoa

Afterwards, Toni and Terri
sat with their .mOther, talking
and remembering. Partly with;

in the fall of 1970; how shy he

So the Food and Drug
Administration is taking
steps to either ban or rigid-
ly curtail turtle sales and
shipments throughout the
'country.

The agency detailed
both alternatives in the
Federal Register and
asked for public comments
by July 29.

According-to recent esti-
mates, pet turtles annually
transmit salmonella poi-
soning to about 280,000
Americans, mostly young
children. The illness is
marked by abdominal
pain, nausea, fever and
diarrhea but rarely is fa-
tal.

Consumers Union peti-

tioned for a total turtle ban
last December in the inter-
est of public health, charg-
ing that the FDA’s 1972
attempt at controlling the
problem had been a
“dramatic and demonstra-
ble” failure.

The Humane Society of
the United States and the

Animal Welfare Institute
joined in the move, plead-

' ing the cause of humanity

to turtles.

They said that most tur-
tles sOld in pet stores are
not miniatures but rather
red-eared redeared sli-
ders, which “under proper

'care" could live 40 years

in captivity but which gen-
erally die within four to six
months. \ -

However, in proposing
an alternative to an out-

right ban, FDA Commis-
sioner Alexander M.

Schmidt expressed the be-
lief that more rigid testing,
certification and, labeling
would be “cumbersome
and unlikely to be com-
pletely effective."

He noted that a 12-month
survey last year by the
US. Center for Disease
Control found 54 per cent
of all supposedly disease-
free turtles to be carrying
salmonella sometime after
certification.

The new plan would re-

_ quire more sensitive meth-

ods of testing for
salmonella organisms,
provide federal funds for
state certification pro-

The local chapter of PRSA heard Dr. William Baker, chairman of
Group Satellite Communications, paint a scenario of challenge to
public relations professionals. Baker said that with the advent of
satellite transmissions to cable TV. systems, we are moving from an
undifferentiated mass market to specialty mass markets. To meet this
need, public relations personnel will have to define target audiences for
their clients, identify which audiences are actually reached by cable TV,
and generate new programming. EGG cooks at the possibilities that
may arise from this fresh media.

New Publications . . . A new. monthly specialty newspaper called

News Briefs

Opportunities missed?

WASHINGTON - Two congressmen complained
today that the Pentagon may be passing up opportun-
ities to free a small number of US. war prisoners by
exchanging them for North Vietnamese POWs.

Reps. Lucian Nedzi and James G. O’Hara, both
Michigan Democrats, leveled the charge after con-
versations with Sgt. John Sexton, recently released
by his Viet Cong captors, and with Defense Depart-
ment officials responsibile for overseeing the POW
matters. ‘

In a Dec. 2 letter to Defense Secretary Melvin R.
Laird, Nedzi and O’Hara said that when Sexton was
freed he carried with him the names of two North
Vietnamese officers who the Viet Cong sought in
return. The lawmakers said they understood that a
third officer was handed over instead because the
other two could not be readily located.

Tight security for trial

SAN JOSE -— The courtroom security for the trial
of Angela Davis has been tightened to include
closed circuit television, an alarm system and
metal detectors.

Miss Davis will be tried on Jan. 31, accused of
murder, kidnap and conspiracy resulting from a
bloody gunbattle at the Marin County Civic Center.

I o
Doesn t sunt her

LOS ANGELES — Actress Loretta Yosng is suing
a television network for $1.3 million because she
was not edited out of old films sold to stations in
foreign countries, where viewers might see her with _
unfashionable hair styles.

The trial of Miss Young’s suit began before a jury
in Superior Court Monday.

Miss Young said her 1959 contract with the
National Broadcasting Co. specifically required the
network to remove her appearances, as narrator in
opening and closing segments of a series of televi-
sion dramas, before the films were released for
foreign viewing.

Heavy Belfast bombings

BELFAST, Northern Ireland -—— Parts of
downtown Belfast were reduced to rubble today by
one of the most extensive waves, of bombings in the
city in three years of violence in Northern Ireland.

At least 13 bombs rocked the city center Monday
in another day of terror in the capital.

In Dublin the city’s Roman Catholic archbishop,
John C. McQuaid, appealed for a five-day Christ-
mas truce in Northern Ireland. But Lt. Gen. Sir
Harry Tuzo, commander of British forces in the
province, rejected the suggestion.

Whale meat use OKd .

, WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Adminis-
tration has reversed itself and given the green light
for use in pet food of two million pounds of sperm

. whale meat previously embargoed because of haz-

 

ardous mercury content.

The policy exception, not publicly announced,
drew criticism from Mrs. Roger L. Stevens, pres-
ident of the Animal Welfare Institute, who called it
a “very bad precedent.”

Sun shines for Hope

DANANG, Vietnam - Bob Hope brought his
Christmas troupe to Vietnam today, and halfway
through his opening monologue, a 24»hour rainfall
stopped and the sun peeked out.

“How hard does it have to rain here before we
call off this war?” Hope cracked just before the
deluge stopped.

Legal Old asked
LOS ANGELES — A resolution urging the Office
of Emergency Preparedness to provide legal ser-
vices to low-income Los Angeles County residents
who suffered losses in the Feb. 9 earthquake was
approved by the Board of Supervisors.

Two sentenced m death

LOS ANGELES - A couple has been sentenced to
prison in connection with the slaying of assistant
US. Atty. Michael Heuer. Catherine Lamb, 26, was
picked up as a hitchhiker on Sunset Boulevard by
the victim, last July.

Officials said they believed Heuer was killed in
the woman’s Hollywood. apartment after they had
met for a second time for a planned date in Las
Vegas, Nev. They said robbery was the apparent
motive.

Sentenced in Superior Court on Monday to five
years to a life term was Gordon Yates, 36, who
lived at Miss Lamb’s apartment. She was convicted
as an accessory and sentenced from one to five
years.

Presndential gift
WASHINGTON - President and Mrs. Nixon will
give full-time members of the White House staff a
velvet-cased color photograph of George Healy’s
1869 portrait of Abrham Lincoln for Christmas.

Police not liable

LOS ANGELES —- The grand jury has found no
evidence of criminal. liability on the part of the
Monrovia Police Department stemming from the
1hanging death of a 13syear-old prisoner in Novem~
er.

The criminal complaints committee of the grand
. jury released the findings Monday, after conducting

lunting the Whaling industry’s harpoon

By Lucia Mouat

Staﬂ’ correspondent of M
f ; The Christian Science Monitor» - "

Washington

HE ROMANTIC WHALING DAYS OF
Melville’s “Moby Dick” are no more.
The whaling industry has combed the

world’s sea’s with such efﬁciency that,

several species of the giant mammal are
close ,to extinction. . ‘ .

A vivid case in point is the now-rare
blue whale, ,largest member of the whale
family. While 30,000 were killed in a single
year some 40 years ago, today only, an esti-
mated 600 to 3,000 of the creatures still
exist.

The problem has intensiﬁed in recent
years. In the 1960’s more whales were killed

—for oil and meat processed into pet food, -

cosmetics, candles, and fertilizer—than in
any decade in the history of the world.

So scarce are they becoming that whale
hunters can barely ﬁll the generous quotas
the industry is allowed.» While hunters
snared 30,000 large ﬁn whales, for instance,
from the Antarctic in 1961, taking nearly
three times the sustainable yield, they now
catch closer to 2,500 ﬁns a. year because
there are far fewer to be found. They could
have taken 10,000 to 12,000 a. year in the

7;: at1¥19608 indeﬁnitely 'withOut depleting '

‘ the stock's.

'}

Alternativetcatch ‘i' ‘

As alternatives, younger ‘whales and
smaller spec1es, such as sei, minke, dol-

phins, and porpoises, are being sought. Any ‘

semblence 'of sport in the venture (if ever
there was any) is long gone since whale
-_,hunters use such sophisticated aids as
helicopters, radar, noise devices to scare
the mammals, and explosive harpoons.
“‘It’s a hideous triumph of efﬁciency—the
whales don’t stand a chance,” says Mrs.
Christine Stevens, president of the Animal
Wtute. '

While some whale protection measures

have been taken, most conservation groups"

feel the actionto date falls far short of the
need.

Main regulatory body for the whaling in-
dustry is the International Whaling Com-
mission (IWC), founded in 1946 by 17 in-
terested nations. Though. charged with con-
Servation“ of whales, it is—in the eyes of
environmentalists —- noticeably more inter-
ested in the short-term profit of the industry.

for the past three years. Many of the other

7 «- member governments ,arei»ar_epresented*by“

ﬁshery or agricultural ofﬁcials.
’ Quotas setvhigh . _

Although the group sets annual quotas on
whale catches, they are generally much
higher than its own scientiﬁc advisory com-
mittee recommends in the interests of pre-
serving the various species. IWC meetings,
held every June. and most recently here in.
Washington, are conducted in secret though
a handful of international-environmental-
group representatives are allowed to sit in
as observers (but only if they keep mum
about details of proceedings).

This year the United States took a strong
conservationist stand at the.,IWC meetings.
U.S. Commissioner Dr. J. L. McHugh, a

“professor of maﬁne resources at the State
University of New York and the man elected
as ,IWC’s chairman for the next three-year
term, forcefully urged reforms which/the
commission had talked about'in a casual
way for years. . ‘ ,

Top on his" agenda was agreement to an
international observer, scheme (to ensure
that Whalers "stick. . honestly to. allotted
quotas, spare protected species and adhere
to other IWC regulations) and to abolition
of the sggea‘lled blue-whale unit 9,! -

" In the end, bymost assessments, the U.S.
put "on an impressive show but" accomplished
little. Although an international-observer

'r plan was agreed to in" principle, the all-im-
portant details have yet to be Worked out.
These are due to be discussed soon and the
possibility for agreement prior to the next
Antarctic season still exists.

The cemmission also agreed that next year
it would consider abolition of the blue-Whale
unit. In setting” ’quotas the IWC cut last
year’s allowance in the North Paciﬁc by 20 ‘
percent but approved Norway’s proposal for
a substantial 2,300 blue-whale units (the U.S.
had recommended 1,800): in the'Antarctic.
With this quota, theﬁn-whale population will
be further reduced; .

“There were some encouraging signs but
there’s still a long way to go,” says a spokes-

- man for the U.S. Department of the Interior
on the subject of this. year’s IWC meeting.
“We’re cautiously hopeful to the point where s

 

" ‘ ﬁrm: on grounds” .

 

we’re going to stick with the commission for
at least another year.”

IWC adjoin-“'3“ *

At the opening plenary session U. Alexis
Johnson, Undersecretary of State for Polit-
ical Affairs, had observed that the very con-
cept of the IWC as an effective way of deal-
ing with conservation of whales was on trial.

Mrs. Joan McIntyre, representative of the
Friends of the Earth Who sat in on most of
the commission’s deliberations, was less
genefbus than the government in her ap-
praisal: “Essentially the commission ac-

'complished nothing. It promised to do more

next yearyrand that’s abOut it.”
. The United States, which has virtually no
whaling industry of its own but has been
importing 25 to 30 percent of the world’s
whale prOducts has recently taken the lead
in a number of strong Whale-conservation
moves. . '

Despite the objections of furriers and
other commercial, interests, Congress in
1969 managed ”to pass into law an endan-

gered-species bill. With this as his backstop,
former Interior Secretary Walter J. Hickel

late last fall put eight whale species (includ-
ing the sperm and major baleen whales) on

the,“endange_red,’.z’list, thus effectively bar-

extinction; ' -

Early positive action

“We’re not going to: Wait until all these
species are on the brink of extinction be-

forerwe take positive action,” he insisted; .
Secretary of Commerce Maurice H. Stan's
followed up the '-Hickel actionqa few months

ago \by taking steps ,to end the last whaling
in the United. States. San Francisco’s Del
Monte ﬁshing company, which takes 'in
aboutLOO whales+ a year in addition to its
main ﬁshing activity, will lose its whaling
license at the end of December. . '
Currently there is a widespread move in

this country to secure a 10-year moratorium ,

on all whaling. A joint resolution requesting
the Secretary of ‘State to call for such ac-
tion passed the Senate without debate June
29 and is under consideration in the House.
‘In introducing the bill there, Rep. William
:S. Broomﬁeld (R) of Michigan, observing
that “the :whale has no lobby,” termed the
:ban “the only possible solution” to the prob-
lem. ' ‘ .

Such groups as the' Environmental De-
fense Fund, New York Zoological Society,
Friends of the Earth, and the Society for

  
 

Animal Protection Legislation have, been _
working hard to build public .. pressureéfor; .

sucha moratorium." “ -

Supporters point to the return of the gray
whale (on the IWC protected list) to the
California coast as an example of what a
moratorium might accomplish. Theyalso
point out that female whales only produce
calves once every four or ﬁve years and
usually one at a time. Moratorium advo-
cates also stress that research into whale
intelligence and social behavior has only
begun to be tapped. _

Dr. Roger S. Payne 'of the Institute for
Animal Behavior, whose research into
whale sounds recently. has led to a remark-‘
able record titled “Songs of the "Humpback
'Whale,” calls the animals the “most be-
guiling, gentle creatures on earth.”

MuCh of the research 'data to date, in-
cluding census figures, are based on whale
carcasses. Biologists are eager to study
them as living creatures in their natural
habitat. A moratorium would give them

- that opportunity. .

“We’ve been killing whales much faster
than we’ve been learning about them,’",says
Mrs. McIntyre.

public concern/is there to act as a pressure
agent. They point to the precedent set by -
the Soviet Union’s banon killing polar bears
(1956), andldolphins (1966). - _
Also when Sén. Fred Harris (D) of Okla-
homa, ‘authorrof a sweeping ocean-mammal
protection bill, visited‘recently with a Rus-
sian ﬁshery ofﬁcial inMoscow, he was told
that the Soviet Union Wouldn’t stop killing
whales until other nations did. (Together
Japan and the Soviet” Union account for 85
percent of all whales killed.) Compared to ‘
the 'usual retort o'f whaling nations that there
are plenty of whales still in the seas, this
comment cuts to the heart of the matter and
points up anew the need for international
accord. ' '.
Economically, whaling is considered a
small business. In all, it may ”bring in $150
million for all nations takingpart in it. Sub-
stitutes for all whale products are available.
If these facts in addition to the U.S. move
to have a moratorium do. not encourage
Whalers to turn to'other more proﬁtable venm
tures, some observers suggeSt a boycott of
other goods from whaling nations may suf-

Dear Dr. Stevens:

‘we are very pleased to invite your organization to participate in the
United Nations Environment Program International Referral System.(UNEP/IRS).
This referral system is designed to improve the transfer and use of environ-
mental infbrmation on a global basis. It does so by joining those who need
infbrmation to those who have it.

Enclosed fer your infbrmation are several brochures which describe
UNEP/IRS and hOW'it works. we have also included source registration
materials for your use in becoming part of the system. we would very much .
like to have your organization share its resourcefulness with others as well
as raise questions through the system.on environmental matters of interest
to you. Toward that end, we encourage you to return the ferm as soon as
possible. As a registered source,.you will be included in both the National
Directory of the United States.and the International Directory of the United
Nations Environment Program.

Some 117 nations are eligible to participate in the UNEP/IRS. Of these,
58 nations have already confirmed their national centers in the system., just
as the State Department has designated the Environmental Protection Agency
to be the united States national center. When you become a source, you will
share infermation with users of these nations on request.

From the literature, you will find that UNEP/IRS has a totally integrated
concept of the environment and its approach is interdisciplinary This permits
you a wide scope fer raising questions. Answering inquiries, will, of course
be limited to your desCribed capabilities.

If you have any questions concerning UNEP/IRS, or on completing the source
input forms, please feel free to write to me or call our office on telephone
(202) 755-1836. We look forward to having your organization participate in
this important global environmental program. .

Si cerely y urs,

NOTE: The maximum length of this paragraph is 300 characters.
Since this section is free text it will appear in the multi-language
version on the International Directory.as four fields.

 

III. CODED ORGANIZATIONAL ATTRIBUTES OF INFORMATION SOURCE

Sponsorship — 3ll

 

The purpose of this section is to define the primary sponsorship
of your organization. In all cases, it is recommended that you indicate
only the maior source of funding and/or control. In many cases, this
will be the parent body, for which other information is requested in
Section 312.

 

It will normally be necessary to indicate more than one attribute
for sponsorship. The first set of attributes describes the type of
organizational sponsor and the second indicates the significance which
this sponsoring organization has for community or geographical area.

NOTE: Please check no more than 5 boxes under sponsorship and
3 boxes under community section,

 

Definitions:

A "Non-governmental (240)" organization can be industrial/commercial,
private (for profit), professional, religious/philosophical, etc.,
United Nations designated non—governmental organization (MGCs) should
tick both "United Nations" and "Non-governmental organizations”.

A "Political organization (320)" is concerned with and organized
for the influencing or directing, as distinguished from administering
of governmental policy:

Example: A political party, a lobbying group

Activities - 312

 

In order for a user to identify the best source, it will often
be an advantage to know the main activities of the parent body. Here
again it is suggested that only the main activity (ies) as seen by the

 

source should be mentioned.

 




 

NOTE: Maximum of 10 boxes

 

Functions - 313~’

 

This section provides a description of the function of the infor4
mation source. The terms unit, agency, department, centre, etc., are
meant to be broadly interpreted. Please choose the term(s) that most
clearly describe the function of your organization. '

NOTE: Maximum of 6 boxes

 

Definition:

"Environmental Unit (200)" — This term is intended to cover any
unit/service/expert which, inside an organization pursuing non-environ-
mental objectives (industrial, business . . . .), deals with the environ-

mental concerns of that organization.

IV. GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE - WORKING LANGUAGE

 

Geographical Area(s) — 414

 

The user's problem might be restricted to a specific geographic
area or unit, i. e., particular country, sea—shore, desert ...... therefore,
to help an efficient match between user and source, it is desirable
that the geographic coverage of information, knowledge, or expertise
of a source be specified as accurately as possible.

Working Language(s) - 415

 

For the purpose of international operation, the source is requested
to note all working languages in which it could effectively communicate
its working knowledge or information. Primary working languages should be
listed first. (English, French, Russian, Spanish).

V. CODED ATTRIBUTES OF INFORMATION SOURCE

 

Availability - 516

 

This section indicates the restrictions and conditions normally
applicable when information is requested. (Notwithstanding the
Availability coded here it is recognized that special conditions may
apply in certain circumstances.)

NOTE: Maximum of 8 boxes.

Output - 517

This section describes the information which can be supplied and
the forms or formats in which it is available.

NOTE: Maximum of 8 boxes under Output and 12 boxes under Output

 

Forms.

 




 

v1. CODED SUBJECT ATTRIBUTES - 618—619

 

This section describes, by the use of subject attributes, the
topics on which the source has available information or expertise.
It is this section which is used to match questions and sources in
terms of subject matter.

The authoritative list of environmental subject attributes is
included with this package of material.

Attributes are listed by alphabetic code in the 26 UNEP/IRS

categories. Attributes appear under all significant words contained
in original text. For example ”Plant Biology" is found under "Biology/
Plant”.

Some individual terms could be incomplete if used alone. It is
therefore normally necessary to use two or more terms to define a
particular environmental subject area. Care should be taken not to
use too many widely different attributes as this can generate
inappropriate requests for substantive information due to incorrect
pairing of subject attributes.

NOTE: 15 boxes are provided for Most Relevant Attributes and
15 boxes are for Other Associated Attributes.

 

Example:

A source has information on the effects of air pollution on
climate and on agriculture - therefore it might choose to
describe itself by the following attributes:

Pollutant effects, climate and meterology, agriculture.

This set of attributes would also match a request for "effects
of climate on agriculture". If this is not within your area
of competence the effective use of Section 205 would be particularly

applicable.

.The subject attributes are classified as "most relevant" and
"other associated". This distinction is provided to allow — source
to differentiate those areas in which information is most complete,
from marginal areas in which the source could, if necessary, provide
some relevant information. The "other associated attributes" fails
to produce Sufficient sources for particular questions and when cross—
disciplinary information is requested.

Maximum care in coding this section is vital to the operation
of IRS. When describing your information source (see definition
of source given previously) using the coded attributes, you should:

1. Strive to be as specific as possible.

2. Be sure to review the entire attribute list to ensure that
no relevant terms are overlooked.

VII. ADDITIONAL ATTRIBUTES— 720

 

This section should be used only when you are unable to adequately
identify the activities of your information source from the existing
attributes. Please indicate the new term(s) which you feel necessary
for an adequate description, with definitions. Whenver possible,
please list the codes of existing attributes which are most clearly
related to your new words or phrases.

 




 

THE INTERNATIONAL REFERRAL SYSTEM FOR SOURCES OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION

THE SOURCE GUIDE

 

1. INTRODUCTION

 

1.1 Background

 

The International Referral System for sources of environmental
information (IRS) is conceived as a mechanism to interconnect users of
environmental information with appropriate sources of such information.

A user, upon addressing a query to IRS, would be given a selected listing
of information sources which would be most likely to be able to satisfy
his information needs'and to help him in dealing with his particular
environmental problems. IRS refers users to potential sources of infor—
mation and is not a source of environmental information itself. Further
background is contained in the IRS brochure "IRS - A Non - technical
Description".

1.2 The IRS Source

 

An IRS source is a functional unit which has information or
knowledge on a particular environmental topic or range of topics, and is
able and willing to provide appropriate information when requested to
do so through the IRS.

An organization may possess one coherent body of environmental
information expertise in which case it should describe itself as a single
source, but many organizations willfind it necessary to describe themselves
as a number of inter-related sources with different areas of specialized
expertise. Since the scope of some sources is very broad, it is desirable
for them to use one input form for each specialized area of environmental
information, with possibly, another form for the more generalized expertise
of the organization as a whole. It is important that each input form
should contain only a limited set of related subject attributes, to
optimise the matching of users' needs with the information sources available.

1.3 The Concept of Parent Organization

 

The Parent Organization (or body) of an IRS information source
is a clearly identifiable directing organization of the source, which has
in common with that information source, the fulfilment of certain objectives.

An obvious charateristic of the parent body of a source is that
it has a name under which it is officially known, and which is sufficient to
identify it. This name for instance could be in a telephone directory,
whereas the source itself is very often identified as a service/organization
of the parent body.

The parent body may not be the direct administrator, controllor
or fund-provider for the source. However, the direction and overall
policy comes from this body. Examples of parent organizations could include:

(a) A government department which would be the parent body

 




 

 

of its division. )

(b) An intergovernmental committee could be the parent
body of one or more sources which themselves are .
funded, administered and controlled by different
organizations, whereas policies are determined
by the committee when it meets.

(c) A research unit dealing with environmental problems
within a company whose primary objective is production
or distribution of goods would normally identify
this company as its parent body.

 

 

II. RESPONSIBILITIES OF A SOURCE
2.1 Answering Requests
2.1.1 It is the responsibility of a source which is registered

in the International System to reply to all requests for information
generated through that system. Replies normally take one of three forms:

(3) Provision of the information requested.

(b) A statement of the specific conditions under which
the desired information can be provided.

(c) A statement, in unusual circumstances, that the
information is not available.

2.1.2 Some referral searches will generate erroneous referrals.
This can be due to incorrect coding of the source description or of the
question, or may be a result of the lack of sufficiently specialized
descriptors for a particular topic. This is inherent in IRS which pro—
vides descriptors at a rather generic level in order to reduce the volume
of descriptors used. In such cases of incorrect referral the source should
inform the user, and IRS, as soon as possible.

2.1.3 Some information in a sources holdings may be considered
as confidential in that its use by certain communities of users may be

unacceptable to the source or its focal point. In such cases the user

should be informed, as quickly as possible, that the information is un-
available.

2.1.4 In all other cases, and particularly where there is some
reason for delay in answering a question, a source should reply to the
request for information stating:

(a) The time it will take to fill the request.

(b) Any restrictions with respect to the availability or
use of the information which will be provided.

 




 

 

(c) Any costs involved (see section 2.2).
(d) Any other relevant information.

2.1.5 There is a section (Availability-516) in the Input
Form for Registration of a source (See Annex I) which allows for noting
of general conditions for the provision of substantive information by that

source.

2.2 Costs and Fees

 

2.2.1 It is a recognized fact that information costs money, and IRS believes
that in general, the user should pay for substantive information generated
through IRS.

2.2.2 The payment of fees is normally the subject of negotiation between the
source and user concerned. In some cases, the respective focal points and/or
UNEP may need to be consulted, particularly with respect to the international
transfer of funds where the user does not have a source of negotiable currency

2.2.3 The IRS is not responsible for the collection of moneys which result
from charges for substantive information.

2.3 Collection of Statistics

 

2.3.1 IRS will collect, through focal points, information needed to
evaluate the performance of the system. With respect to sources this infor-
mation will include:

(a) Number of requests received through IRS.

(b) Number of requests rejected, with reasons for
rejection (non—specific).

(c) Number of requests filled.
(d) Average time to fill a request.

2.3.2 Your focal point may request information from you on a periodic
basis to assist it in compiling the above statistics.

2.4 Communication with IRS

2.4.1 Communications with IRS by a source (other than an Organizational
Participant - see section III) will normally be channeled through its Focal
Point Communications received by IRS directly from sources will be copied
by IRS to the appropriate focal point.

2.5. Translation

It is normally the responsibility of the user to translate any material
received into his own working language. In certain cases the source may be
better able to provide this service in which case it is assumed that appro—

 




 

   

priate fees will be negotiated.

2.5.2 The International Directory operates in four languages

(English, French, Russian and Spanish) and it is assumed that ,
each information source will have facilities for reading IRS 1
documents in one of these languages. , y’. f

u' .

III. SUBFOCAL POINTS

 

3.1 Subfocal points will consist of selected government agencies

and non-governmental organizations which serve as parent organizations
of several sources. An agency or organization will be recommended

by the U. S. National Focal Point and approved by the Interagency
Committee before it is extended a formal invitation to become at.
focal point. Upon acceptance of the invitation the agency or
.organization assumes the responsibilities for the functions of a
subfocal point.

3.2 The functions of a subfocal point will be to identify and
register sources within its particular Agency on forms provided
by USNFP; update descriptions of sources voluntarily and as
requested by USNFP; aid users and the USNFP in defining questions
in areas of its special competence; assist in training UNEP/IRS
fellows as properly requested by USNFP; assist in evaluating the
system; and participate in special meetings on the International
Referral System organized by the National Focal Point.

IV. UPDATING OF SOURCE DESCRIPTION

4.1 After registering as a source and periodically thereafter
you will receive a computer printed version of the record for

your source of the International Directory. It is then your
responsibility to ensure that the information contained in this
record is correct, complete and up to date. Modifications can

be made on the printout and a-copy returned to your focal point.
For more extensive revisions, a new registration form will be

required.

I INTRODUCTION .

As a result of Recommendation 101 of the United

Nations Conference held in Stockholm, Sweden, inI' ..-
‘ June 1972, the U. N. General Assembly in October 1972 ‘ '

] established the International Referral System (“The

System”) under the United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) and is headquartered at Nairobi, g

Kenya.

In March 1975 the State Department designated the I
U. S. EnVironmental Protection Agency (EPA) to
serve as the U. S. National Focal Point Of “The Sys-'

tem” and EPA formally. opened its center on October
_ 6, 1975, at its Headquarters in Washington, D.V.C. <

_ The U. S. National Focal Point is named the
United States International Environmental Referral -

[Center (USIERC).

WHAT IS THE INTERNATIONAL REFERRAL - '

,- SYSTEM?

“The System” is a network of National and VI-nter- VV

national Focal Points engaged in developing and

operating directories of sources of environmental ' V

111101mat10n under the auspices Of the United Nations

Environment Program. It is a referral service, not ‘

an information delivery svstem

Each National Focal POint is designated and;

ﬁnanced by the gove111me11t of a country and is re—

sponsible for developing the diiectory and operating .

referral services f01 that nation as part of- “The
System”. By the end of 1975 some 58 nations had

" agreed to establish National Focal Points for “The? V

System”

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE ,
INTERNATIONAL REFERRAL SYSTEM ‘2

The purpose of “The System” is to link users and V V '
sources of environmental information .under condi- .

tions that will provide for, the transfer and use of

environmental information on a global basis. It

points out “who knows “hat to who needs What”
on request.

I WHAT IS A SOURCE?

A source is a single coherent body of information
concerning a single aspect of the environment. It

may be an organization or part of an Organization, .
which is a functional unit and has information or I
. knowledge On a particular environmental tOpic or
: range of topics.

Examples are infOrm‘ation - center‘s, data bases,

"libraries, research labOratories, monitoring stations,

legislatures, patent ofﬁces, planning centers, policy
making ofﬁces, or conservation clubs.
In action, a source performs the following functions:

0 Receives. Inquiries directly from users and answers

those it can

“Since Stockholm”
by

RUSSELL E. TRAIN
Administrator
Environmental Protection Agency

Like other lchairmen of national delegations to the United Nations
Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm in 1972, I
have been waiting impatiently to see practical, down-to—earth results.

Our impatience is ﬁnally being rewarded! Today marks the beginning
of the US. portion of an extremely useful UN Environment program——
the International Referral System—or IRS. This is the ﬁrst practical
activity, stemming from Stockholm, to reach the ﬁnal stages of com-
pletion. As the US. National Focal Point for IRS, EPA has a chance
now to actively contribute to a signiﬁcant world-wide follow-through
after Stockholm.

You will be hearing from Mr. Al Alm in detail as to how our National
Focal Point program will operate.

We have learned since Stockholm how important it is to seek inter-
national cooperation in our efforts to protect our own eco-system. Like
children growing up in different families, national programs for protect-
ing the environment are advancing at different rates and different
directions. This means that almost any country may have one research
program, or control device or even unusual environmental situation
which other countries could usefully know about.

No nation should have to do environmental research already com-
pleted by another or live in ignorance of control technology developed by
another. For this very reason we try to keep in constant touch with our
“opposite number” agencies all over the world, not to mention the en-
vironmental division of international organizations—particularly OECD,
NATO, and the Common Market, as well as the United Nations.

IRS will serve to .speed and spread the news of existing and newly
acquired data. It will help all UN members to build more quickly and
efﬁciently their own environmental protection mechanism.

UN members are moving with fairly commendable speed to implement
other positive actions approved at Stockholm.

 




 

Russell E. Train, Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency.

The ﬁrst was to establish the United Nations Environment Program
(UNEP) as a permanent Specialized Agency of the UN. This was done

_ at the UN General Assembly in the fall of 1972. Second, the recom-

mendation that delegations persuade their countries to act at the national
level has also brought a good response. Whereas in 1970 our EPA was
the ﬁrst one of its kind announced in the world, there are now some 50
roughly similar organizations in other countries.

I am happy to report that we have established excellent and useful
relationships with most of these other EPAs. In fact, thanks to Dolores
Gregory and Sarah Kadec there is a daily exchange of documents on
respective developments of other national environmental organizations
and our own. These exchanges are recorded in our monthly document
“Summaries of Foreign Government Reports.”

Additionally, since the Stockholm Conference, it has become common-
place to incorporate environmental considerations in development pro-
grams. For example, the World Bank will not approve a capital-intensive
project that does not have built-in safeguards in terms of environmental
impact. As you recall, Mr. McNamara, President of the World Bank,
said at Stockholm that the difference in cost between an environmentally
sound project and one without any safeguards is negligible.

Many developing nations now wish to establish environmental protec—
tion machinery as they industrialize their economy. They have sought
and received support to this end from the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP). EPA has provided scores of experts for varying
periods to assist these nations, and the UNDP and the World Health
Organization (WHO) have contributed resources for this purpose. We
wish we had more human resources to offer, but our ability to participate
is, of course, limited by our own national commitments and requirements.
I personally would like to see the US. Agency for International Develop-
ment "take on this kind of program and greatly expand what EPA has
begun.

Meanwhile, the US, and EPA in particular, will continue to assist
other nations by providing expertise and information, or participating
in seminars to support the UNEP and other multinational environmental
efforts.

We are proud to work with other nations as the spirit of Stockholm
continues to inspire mankind to save its biosphere. I must say I am also
pleased that many of our joint activities with other nations provide EPA
with answers to some of our knottiest problems. I am conﬁdent that IRS
will spread more answers to more EPAs everywhere.

“United Nations Environment Program”
by

NOEL J. BROWN
Senior Liaison Ofﬁcer
United Nations Environment Program

Ladies and Gentlemen—Distinguished colleagues

On behalf of the Executive Director and the United Nations Environ-
ment Program, I would like to say how very pleased we are to be asso-
ciated with this event today.

The INAUGURATION OF THIS NATIONAL COMPONENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL REFERRAL SYSTEM is a matter to which
we at the United Nations Environment Program attach particular signiﬁ-
cance and for which we feel a sense of genuine fulﬁllment and pride——
which I believe understandable.

From the earliest stages, the International Referral System has always
received strong support from the United States—which was one of the
ﬁrst countries to identify and mobilize major resources in support of the
system. Through the PROGRAM being launched today, we look forward
to the continuing support of the United States in this vital information
area. It is our hope also that this National Registry of Sources will serve
as a working model of the focal point concept and help train managers in
its design, operation and use.

As more national components like this one are established, I believe
we will see emerging one of the most unique and perhaps most widely
used systems of the United Nations environment community.

In essence, the IRS is designed to act as a dynamic mechanism to
encourage, on an organized and systematic basis, the interchange of
environmental information and environmental education programs at all
levels.

As such, it is a system designed to put the user in contact with sources
of information and, more importantly, to develop a relationship of
encouragement between the user and the source as well as among the
various elements of the referral program. In this connection, we foresee
a user community that is likely to be very broad indeed and will un-
doubtedly include—ADMINISTRATORS, LEGISLATORS, SCIENTI-

 

Noel Brown, Senior Liaison Officer, United Nations Environment Program.

 




 

FIC AND TECHNICAL PRACTITIONERS, PLANNERS, TEACH-
ERS, CITIZENS, J OURNALISTS AS WELL AS TECHNICALLY
TRAINED WORKERS ~IN GOVERNMENT OR INDUSTRY IN-
VOLVED IN THE SOLVING OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS.

Moreover, as environmental problems cannot be solved in isolation,
one can easily foresee the user list rapidly intersecting many other
disciplines and programs . . . and most certainly, many components of
the United Nations system itself.

For example, one of the most signiﬁcant developments within the
United Nations since Stockholm is what might be termed—the tendency
toward action planning at the global level. Here, one simply has to note
that characteristic of all the major conferences of the last few years——
Population and Food of 1974, Raw Materials and Development—1975,
HABITAT—1976, Water and Desertiﬁcation Conference—1977—are
ACTION PLANS. Within these plans, provisions are generally made for
monitoring mechanisms to serve as EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS,
including provisions for the creation of global data bases as a prime
requirement of sound policy making. Yet, with the exception of the
United Nations Environment Program, none of the plans established so
far makes any provision for referral services or information exchange
system on a scale comparable to that of the IRS. There can be little
doubt, therefore, that sooner or later the IRS will be called upon to
play a supportive role in the implementation of these action plans.

At the same time, it should be recognized that UNEP itself is likely
to be a major user in view of the potential of IRS as a GENERALIZED
“INVENTORY—TAKING FACILITY”, and our responsibility to pre-
pare periodically “STATE OF THE ENVIRONMENT REPORTS”
within the framework of EARTHWATCH. To be useful, however, any
such reports will require data of a high degree of accuracy and authority
which, through its comparative character and cross-veriﬁcation capa-
bilities, IRS is in a position to provide.

But despite the promise of IRS and its importance in environmental
problem—solving, there are some who have become IMPATIENT with
the slow pace with which it has evolved, and others who cite this as
proof of a slackening of the momentum of Stockholm and the lack of
serious commitment on the part of Governments to the realization of
the EARTHWATCH Program. EARTHWATCH, after all, has come to
be considered as the centerpiece of the United Nations Environment
System and the index of the Program’s viability. Consequently, the
progress of the Program tends to be measured in terms of EARTH-
WATCH capabilities and activities.

6

Such judgements, understandable as they are, may not fully appreciate

the magnitude of the task at hand and the complexity of the system
now coming into being. Moreover, it is an established fact that within
international organizations it takes anywhere from three to ﬁve years
to develop information programmes of the quality and reliability for
the kind of scientiﬁc research and uses envisaged under IRS—more
especially so, since the question of INTER-COMPARABILITY OF
DATA IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE.
_ On the other hand, we in UNEP have reason to feel encouraged—
our own administrative mechanism has undergone a major overhaul
and our capacity for organization and management of EARTHWATCH
has been greatly enhanced. More importantly, however, is the fact that
many Governments, which hitherto have either been hostile or indifferent
to the concept of EARTHWATCH and IRS, are increasingly displaying
interest in its operation, and their participation is being energetically
encouraged.

Presently, our network of national partners numbers 54, and we hope
that this number will increase rapidly. Certainly, leadership by the
United States in this area could go a long way towards accelerating that
process.

To be fully effective, however, IRS must move beyond the network
of national focal points to that of REGIONAL AND EVEN SEC-

TORAL PARTNERSHIP—and here again the trends are quite en- '

couraging.

Within the economic regions, certain of the Economic Commissions
have expressed interest in being associated—and in order to stimulate
and encourage regional interest, the United Nations Environment Pro-
gram will be sponsoring a series of Regional Seminars intended to serve
as a forum for intensive discussions on management issues relating to
the planning and operation of focal points. The ﬁrst of these was held
at the end of September in Nairobi for East Africa and West Asia. A
second is planned for Geneva at the end of October for North America
and West Europe for which both the United States and Canada are
providing expert support. Later seminars have also been planned for
West Africa, Latin America, East Asia, East Europe, etc., and should
average about one every 45 days.

When fully operational, the IRS will thus add an important manage-
ment tool to the international system, where issues of cause and effect
relationships are assuming increasingly ominous proportions. Moreover,
the world can ill-afford the pattern of “DISCOVERY BY ACClDENT”,
as we have in the case of the ozone—depletion and the risk that we may

7

 




 

have transgressed the outer limits in many areas vital to our survival.
Just as the environment cannot be nationalized, its management can
no longer be a matter of chance disclosures nor can the existence of
vital data be considered the exclusive possession of national Govern-
ments. In this connection, IRS potential for information-sharing is thus
a welcome development.

No system, no matter how well designed and efﬁcient in its operation,
can hope to meet the information needs of the world community without
addressing itself to the special information problems of the Third
World and inability of some of its members to fully participate in a
global information system. One of the major challenges facing UNEP is
to help develop the capacities of emerging countries to develop and
manage national environmental information systems—particularly those
countries lacking the basic framework for information collecting and
processing.

FOCAL POINT COLLEAGUES—at the United Nations today, the
Developing Countries have intensiﬁed their demand for a more effective
participant role in their call for a new international economic order and
suddenly the system seems to be responding, though much difﬁcult
work lies ahead. The best order, however, will endure only to the
degree that it satisﬁes basic human needs and enhances the quality of
“life for all”.

Without serious regard for the environment, a life of quality, as
called for in the New International Economic Order, is likely to be a
short-lived phenomenon. It is our hope that many of the critical de-
cisions yet to be made will reﬂect environmental preservation as crucial
to survival of human well-being—and here access to sound data is of
central importance.

It is clear, however, that as we attempt to assess conﬂicting global
trends, the basic challenge remains the management of the world’s ﬁrst
truly technological civilization. For, our technological order, barely two
hundred years old, has modiﬁed our existence more profoundly than
any other human activity in the several millenia of man’s existence.
Our culture seems to have lost the capacity to control technological
dynamics. As a matter of fact, one of the central factors of the techno-
logical order is the absence of interior control.

Some writers like Philip Rieff go so far as to suggest that “TECH-
NOLOGY IN ITS VERY PRINCIPLE IS THE ABSENCE OF IN-
TERIOR CONTROL” and that the technological ethos simply demands
that “what can be done must be done”.

There are some who argue that man is not intelligent enough to

survive his present crisis—he has built a world so complex with so
many interacting factors, that the human mind can no longer see its
way through the maze to discern the ultimate effects of decisions and
actions taken today.

Others, like Jay W. Forestors, suggest that the evolutionary processes
had not given us the mental skill needed to properly interpret that
dynamic behaviour of the system of which we have now become a part
—hence the use of simulators and mathematical models.

It is becoming increasingly obvious, however, that what is needed
is a technique that could help the world leaders assess the long-term
effects of their decisions on the physical and social environments
BEFORE such decisions are made. This would involve a fundamentally
new approach to societal decision-making.

It would thus seem, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, that what is
being suggested is a style of policy and action whereby long-term con-
siderations must become the premise of all decisions and a central
operating procedure. This would mean consideration of a signiﬁcantly
longer time horizon than the ﬁve years which is customary, as well as
better methods of evaluating the full consequences of decisions which
affect both the physical and social environment—and here the role
of IRS should become clearly manifest.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN—IRS is not a magic formula, but
another signiﬁcant step in the management of the planet man calls home.

“State Department’s Role”
by

CHRISTIAN HERTER, JR.
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Environmental and POpulation Affairs
State Department

Thank you very much. After that elaborate introduction, for which I
thank you, there is very really little, I think, needs to be said. You
got a full program getting into the substance of this operation. And
after what Noel Brown has described to you, there is very little left
to be said.

From the point of view of the State Department, I’d just like to
make two very brief comments. The ﬁrst is that at the Stockholm
Conference, as Russ Train has explained, there was this continuous
demand to know by people of the conference: What was going on in
the world environment? Where could one ﬁnd out information about it?
Why didn’t the scientist know more? How could we work out a system
whereby we could learn more about what is happening in the environ-
ment and through which the results of the learning could be made
available to all countries? This was the theme that pervaded.

Remember this was only about four years ago. As a matter of fact,
it was less than that. Stockholm was three years ago. And at that time,
many countries in the world did not even know what the word environ—
ment was. ’

But I think we’ve come an awfully long way since then, at least in
terms of awareness. For the ﬁrst time through the IRS Focal Point
systems as it appears in the United Nations Environment Program, we
are beginning to put together the threads here. This is what you fellows
have done. You are meeting the ﬁrst demand for scientiﬁc information,
and secondly, the demand for very practical information—as to how
and what has been done elsewhere.

I can remember just a simple old question and I use these purely
as examples, but if a tropical nation at a semi—developed level wants to
ﬁnd out what kind of sewage system, let’s say, it can use, given its
climate, that is within its means, obviously a very sophisticated indus-
trial state won’t be much help to it. How does it ﬁnd out what another
tropical nation of like resources has done about this problem? One of
our theories and hopes all along is that we would have a mechanism
to begin providing some of the answers not only in terms of the research

11

 

 

 




 

involved, and the more esthetic aspects of environmental learning, but
very practical useful information that some of the developing countries
can’t get elsewhere and don’t even know where to start looking for it.
Now this demand has been increasing as time has gone on since
Stockholm. On the other side, the supply, it seems extraordinary to me
the amount of information that there is but nobody knows where it is.
Not only are we talking about government but all levels of government
—federal, state, and local—in this country. We are also talking about
the extensive work going on in universities, in this area and out in in-
dustry. The industrialists themselves particularly those industries that
have the major problems of an environmental nature, have done a tre-
mendous amount of research and have a great deal of practical
experience. At any one time, it’s almost impossible to tell where this
information is, who do you get hold of for assistance, how do you ﬁnd
out about it. You add to what we know in this country, with its enor-
mous variety and great wealth of experience, the knowledge of other
countries, the total is vast. All countries have some knowledge, whether
they be developed countries dealing with environmental problems, such
as the UK, Germany, Soviet Union, or the developing countries.

There is a vast amount of environmental information. I think you
yourselves know that all you have to do is take a look at the EPA library
to ﬁnd out. There is also a vast amount to be learned too, but it is not
focused in any one place, and nobody knows how to get at it. So that
it seems to me today is the beginning of one half or one part of pulling
together a structure whereby it will be possible for those who want to
ﬁnd something out that would help their country deal with their prob-
lems, where they can ﬁnd out what information there is in the world
that is relevant to their own experience.

The second part is obviously the question of will it work and how
to make it work. We’ve set up the structure and as Noel Brown pointed
out I think the US. is the ﬁrst to have a focal point and I’d like to add
my congratulations to those of Mr. Green’s to the ladies who have done
so much about pulling this together. I understand that there is now a
ﬁve-man team here in EPA and this becomes the National Focal Point.
The real challenge now is to get similar focal points and to have some-
body realize that the system is some help to them so that they will use it.
I dare say this is going to take some time too. The whole concept of the
International Referral System is part of Earthwatch. It is the ﬁrst program
of Earthwatch that has actually gotten into action and we in the Depart-
ment are obviously very, very pleased.

12

 

 

Now the second point I mentioned, is how come EPA happens to be
the focal point for the system in the US. The State Department was
asked to select the focal point and I might say we’ve had an awfully
hard time trying to ﬁgure out what agency to use. We’ve tried all sorts
of agencies. We have been thinking about this thing and our problem
with the Environmental Protection Agency was its self sufﬁciency. As
you know, the focal point is supposed to reach out to other agencies, in-
dustries, the academic establishment, and other non-governmental orga-
nizations, all of which will take a period of time, but our experience
with EPA was that they knew'so much about so many subjects, we did
not feel that they’d ever go beyond their own resources and that we
would have no contacts outside. I’m saying this facetiously, but never-
theless this is one great worry. Well it wasn’t a very hard problem in
truth. EPA was the perfect natural place to have this entire system
operate in this country. With its research, with its very practical experi-
ence, with its regional ofﬁces all over the country, and with its growing
contacts both with the academic community, and we were delighted, in
fact, it was set up here, that it is operating.

Mr. Alm is going to talk about the mechanics of it. And we are
extremely pleased in the totality of our international effort to see it
established here.

Thank you very much and I appreciate the opportunity to say a
few words.

“EPA’s Role as National Focal Point”
by

ALVIN ALM
Assistant Administrator for Planning and Management
Environmental Protection Agency

Environmental quality control is extraordinarily complex, requiring
a wide range of information. Standard setting, problem deﬁnition, proj-
ect management involve a range of disciplines—biology, hydrology,
economics, technology and so on.

There is, we know, a vast store of information in all these ﬁelds.
Yet access is often limited by lack of awareness on the part of users of
information sources and lack of skills in retrieving the information.

The International Referral System is viewed as an opportunity not
only to trade information among countries of the world but also to
enhance national referral services. EPA, designated National Focal
Point for the United States, has committed signiﬁcant manpower and
ﬁnancial resources to the operation with expectations of better serving
the needs of environmental information users in the private sector as
well as government.

The National Focal Point, under the directorship of William Bennett,
is administratively under the EPA Library Systems Branch headed by
Sarah Kadec.

In its lead agency role, EPA has management responsibility for:
—inventory of U.S. organizations which will participate in the IRS.
-—-national directory of information sources to be included in the

IRS International Directory.
—referral service to respond to requests from IRS users both
within the U.S. and from other countries.

As National Focal Point, EPA is also responsible for liaison with
the UNEP/IRS Central Unit in Nairobi and with other countries on
matters related to national focal point management.

Success will depend upon active cooperation of all groups represented
here today—government, universities, business and industry, professional
associations, citizens groups and other non proﬁt organizations. EPA
invites all of you to actively participate in this important international

endeavor.

“Role of. Other Agencies ._ Importance of Participation”
by

JAMES T. CLARKE
Assistant Secretary — Management
Department of Interior

It is a pleasure for me, both personally and from an agency standpoint,
to participate today. The general subject matter has been thoroughly
discussed by the prior speakers. As a result, I’d like to focus on several
speciﬁc areas that have not been touched.

One of the things that has most impressed me during the three years
that I have been in my present job is the difﬁculty in identifying the rich
lodes of information which frequently lie hidden within the various
Federal agencies.

I had occasion to journey to Sioux Falls, a very delightful town in
South Dakota. It is also the home for the EROS Data Center—The
center, a part of the Geological Survey, is among other things a huge
computer processing facility. It acquires, processes and disseminates
environmental information mostly from two NASA satellites which are
currently rotating around the earth about 14 times a day, as well as some
other NASA research aircraft. These various scanning devices, use regu-
lar photography and various other kinds of rather exotic techniques.

You might be interested to know that there are presently ground
stations around the world Which have the capability of acquiring directly
the data output from these satellites, but most of it is processed by the
Data Center.

Looking at the wealth of information which this program was generat~
ing, I asked the program managers what were their most serious prob-
lems. Well, they said they had overcome most of the technical diﬁiculties.
Like all programs, they had their funding problems. But the thing that
was of most concern was getting the information collected to potential
users. I felt that it was quite signiﬁcant that their assessment of their
most severe problem was the diﬂiculty of making users aware that this
considerable environmental information was available. And second, to
get the people who were aware of it to become more sophisticated in its
application.

17

 




 

Now, I’m certain that Interior is no exception when it comes to
current strains on the budget. Each new demand strains the manpower
and resources that we have. We look very critically at any participation
in any program, especially one that is outside our department. We have
looked at this particular one. We’re impressed with its utility for us as
an individual agency, and we’re prepared to participate fully.

I might add at this point that one of the things we’re particularly
sensitive to is the problem of collecting environmental data and the asso-
ciated technical analysis. This sensitivity springs from the many environ-
mental impact statements which we have to prepare. These statements
are time consuming and demanding of objective data and analysis. We
know we don’t have a corner on the market in terms of this capability,
but we’re optimistic that programs of this nature will assist us greatly.

We’ve already hooked in about ﬁfty of our environmental data pro-
grams into the US. National Focal Point. We expect that other program
managers will soon join. We’re going to encourage them to do so.

As an old data processor, I still remember the term “GIGO.” It is a
term that translates—garbage-in—garbage-out. The purpose of mem-
tioning the term here is that the Focal Point structure which has been put
in place internationally and within this country is just that: its a structure.
And its going to be up to the participating agencies to make sure that the
kind 0f information which goes in is useful to the users when it comes out.

We’re going to fully support the Environmental Protection Agency in
this effort and expect to work cooperatively with other governmental
agencies. And we’re prepared to encourage the participation in and use
of this system. We hope you will do the same. Thank you very much.

INTRODUCTION

 

The United Nations Environment Program had
its origins in the first United Nations Conference
on the Human Environment held in Stockholm, Sweden,
June 1972. It was convened in order to bring to
the attention of governments and people of the
world evidence that man's activities were damaging
the natural environment and were giving rise to
serious risks for the survival and well-being of
man himself.

In closing, the Conference adopted a Declara-
tion on the Human Environment and an Action Plan
with proposed institutional and financial arrange-
ments for its support and implementation.

Later that same year, the General Assembly
of the United Nations adopted a resolution declaring
the need for the implementation of measures by
governments and the international community to
protect and improve the human environment. They
then formulated a Governing Council for the Environ-
ment Program composed of 58 countries, a secretariat
to serve as management headquarters, an Environment
Fund to provide additional financing and an Environ-
ment Coordination Board to synchronize United Nations
environmental programs.

The "Stockholm Conference" Action Plan was
accepted by the General Assembly and referred to
its newly created United Nations Environment Pro-
gram Governing Council for implementation.

Toward that realization, the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) seeks to achieve three
basic aims:

1. To promote international cooperation in
the environmental field.

2. To keep under review the world environ-
mental situation in order to assure that
environmental problems of wide inter—
national significance receive appropri-
ate consideration by governments.

3. To promote the acquisition, assessment
and exchange of environmental knowledge.

_ 1 _

 




 

Several diverse programs have evolved from
UNEP. One of them is the International Referral
System. It is predicated on a network of
national and international focal points, each
responsible for identifying and registering
sources of environmental information within its
scope of operation, and promoting the exchange of
substantive information.

Each of the governments of the 58 nations
comprising the Governing Council is responsible
for establishing a Focal Point Office in its
country and providing the necessary operating
funds. In March 1975, the United States Depart—
ment of State designated the Environmental Pro—
tection Agency as the lead agency charged with the
responsibility of the U. S. National Focal Point.
Then on October 6, 1975, the U. S. office officially
opened its doors and became operational. It has
since been named the United States International
Environmental Referral Center (USIERC). By
September 1, 1976 over 2500 potential sources had
been identified and over 500 had registered and
agreed to participate fully in the system.

The intent of this booklet is to offer assis-
tance and guidelines for using the United Nations
Environment Program/International Referral System.
It is hoped that by providing a thumbnail sketch
of the Program's history as well as a detailed
explanation of the terms of operation, accompanied
by illustrations, we will make the use of the
"System" simple and satisfying.

PURPOSE OF THE INTERNATIONAL REFERRAL SYSTEM

 

Since a data bank of all available environ-
mental information would be enormous and therefore
virtually impossible to effeciently maintain
up-to-date, a referral system was chosen as the
beSt mode of information dissemination. In this
way those with questions or problems concerning the
environment can be given names and addresses of
relevant knowledgeable sources anywhere in the
world which are able to supply the answers or
help in solving the problems. Descriptions of
the most likely sources and their capabilities

 

would be supplied in sufficient detail to enable
the questioner to choose the information source
or sources which best suit his/her needs. These
sources and their descriptions would constitute
the national directory and be included in the
international directory. It is the object of
this system then that it benefit decision-makers
at all levels by making available the best and
most timely knowledge in the forms and at the
time when it can be useful.

WHAT IS A SOURCE? — A source is a functional unit
which has information or knowledge on a parti—
cular environmental topic or range of topics and

is able and willing to provide appropriate infor-
mation when requested to do so through the "System".

 

WHO CAN USE IRS (International Referral System)?

 

The growing concern over environmental matters
is reflected in the very large increase in the
amount of information being produced and in the
number of people who need environmental information.
Those served by the International Referral System
are national and state government agencies, busi-
ness and industry, university and research insti-
tutions and others concerned with environmental
matters.

USERS'NEEDS - Many peOple who want to use environ-
mental information may not know what information

is available or how to go about asking their
questions. They need to know where to get this
information, how to get it, and perhaps even more
important, how to use it. The same information

may be used by different groups for different pur-
poses; for example by legislators to draft laws,

by citizen groups to participate in public hearings,
by journalists to write news stories and by tech-
nologists to measure and control pollutants. It

is the function of IRS to refer the questioner to
the best source which can supply information to
assist in meeting his needs in a form he can use.

 

 




 

WHAT AREAS ARE COVERED BY THE TERM "ENVIRONMENT"

There are twenty-six categories with 877
subsections, called subject attributes, which
cover everything from Atmosphere and Climate to
Waste (Appendix #1). Any question which is
covered by these categories is a likely candidate
for referral.

Many of the attributes appear under more
than one category. If there are two or more words
composing the attribute, they will also appear in
an inverted fashion. For example, forecasting,
short—range, weather can be found under short
range weather forecasting and weather, short-range
forecasting.

HOW TO SUBMIT QUESTIONS — When a need for environ-
mental information arises it should be defined,
preferably in writing, as concisely as possible
and submitted as an inquiry directly to the
U. S. International Referral Center.

While defining one's need, the following seven
broad elements should be considered.

Inquiries should begin with the expression:
"Would you identify sources of information
on ---------- " or“Request sources of informa-
tion on --------- ". The rest of the query should
be expressed in the natural language of the sub—
ject. It would also be helpful to describe brief-
ly the project which generated the request, state
its purpose, and tell how the information will be
used.

UNEP/IRS RESPONSE TO USER: When a query is received
by USIERC it is analyzed and coded using descriptors
from a subject attribute list agreed upon by repre-
sentatives of the 58 nations establishing the referral

 




 

 

system. The coded question is then used to

search the national directory for sources with
sufficient information to treat the inquiry. A
photocopy is made of each pertinent source descrip-
tion and transmitted to the requester. With source
descriptions in hand, the user can make a decision

as to which source(s) to approach directly for 3
information. In cases where the national sources i
cannot fulfill a request for any reason, a search 1

of the international directory will be made.

USIERC endeavors to respond to inquiries in 48

hours through its own data base. However, responses
through UNEP/IRS take considerably longer. It

could vary.from 10 to 30 days, depending on the
nature of the inquiry.

Upon receipt of the photocopied source sheet(s)
the user should examine the full record of each to
decide which source(s) to contact directly. There
are 13 elements of a source record which should
be considered. A sample source sheet with an
explanation of each element appears in illustrations
#2-5. The most pertinent element is the name and
address. After the examination is completed, the
user can present his query directly to the chosen
sources and request any substantive information
desired.

OBLIGATION OF SOURCES: The function of the source

is to accept and respond to questions submitted

to it through the International Referral System

in an effective manner and to participate in
evaluation of the system. Sources may raise questions,
as well as submit questions for clients to the United
States International Environmental Referral Center.
Sources may reServe the right to limit the provision
of information on specific cases. However, sources
participating are required to reply to all queries
addressed to them through the system within a
reasonable time.

COST: All referral services are free to users.

From the time a user send an inquiry to the National
Focal Point until he receives a source address,
there is no charge. A source may charge for
substantive information provided in response to

a query. In the event there are charges, they
will depend on the type of information requested
and the particular source selected. Deciding

and agreeing on the condition and mode of payment
is the responsibility of the user and the source.
The U.S.I.E.R.C. will not become involved in
setting and collecting fees for substantive
information growing out of referrals.

SYSTEM EVALUATION: Each National Center is re-
quired to collect statistics on the effectiveness
of the system. For this reason, USIERC may
approach sources and users to determine the
appropriateness of the referral information, and
the degree of satisfaction obtained in response
to requests for substantive information addressed
to sources as a result of each System referral.

A brief evaluative questionnaire will normally be
sent for this purpose and participants, sources
and users, are expected to respond.

 

CONCLUSION: The United States International
Environmental Referral Center is as its name
implies a "Referral Center". That means that it
is an analyzing, identifying and switching opera-
tion between source and user to join "Who Knows
What" with "Who Needs What".

We encourage you to use the "System" in order
to discover the treasure of information it can
provide.

POLICY STATEMENTS

I. ORGANIZATIONAL PARTICIPANTS
A. Policy

The U. S. National Focal Point (USNFP) will have two levels
of organizations in the referral system: subfocal points and
sources.

1. Subfocal point

Subfocal points will consist of selected government
agencies and non-governmental organizations which serve as
parent organizations of several sources. An agency or organi-
zation will be recommended by the U. S. National Focal Point
and approved by the Interagency Committee before it is
extended a formal invitation to become a subfocal point. Upon
acceptance of the invitation the agency or organization assumes
the responsibilities for the functions of a subfocal point.

a. Function

The functions of a subfocal point will be to identify
and register sources within its particular agency on forms pro-
vided by USNFP; update descriptions of sources. voluntarily
and as requested by USNFP; aid users and the USNFP in de-
ﬁning questions in areas of its special competence; assist in
training UNEP/IRS fellows as properly requested by USNFP;
assist in evaluating the system; and participate in special meet-
ings on the International Referral System organized by the
National Focal Point.

2. Source
The U. S. National Focal Point accepts the international
deﬁnition of a source as a single coherent body of information
concerning a single aspect of the environment. A source may be
an independent unit or part of an organization, or institution.
Several sources may have the same parent organization.

 

 




 

 

B.

a. Registration
, Any organization or part of an organization which is
a functional unit and has information or knowledge on a par-
ticular environmental topic or range of topics and is able and

willing to provide appropriate information when requested to

do so through the International Referral System may register
as a source. _

Sources will be invited to register directly by the
USNFP and /or by subfocal points on forms provided by the
USNFP. .

The USNFP will compile a directory of registered
sources for inclusion in the International Referral System.

b. Function
The function of the source is to accept and respond

to questions submitted to it thrOugh the International Referral
System in the most effective manner feasible and to participate
in evaluation of the system. Sources may raise questions as well
as submit questions for clients to the United Nations Environ-
ment Program International Referral System.
Procedures

Questions on environmental information will be submitted in
written form. Sources will be supplied copies of a standard in-
formation request form which the source may reproduce for use
in submitting inquiries. Questions may be sent by letter, tele-
gram, cable or memorandum. In some cases they may be sent
by telephone or on-line through a data base.

II. SOURCE REGISTRATION FORM WITH MODIFICATION
A. Policy

The U. S. National Focal Point will use a modiﬁed version
of the International Referral System International source regis--
tration form.

B. Limitations of Descriptors
The U. S. National Focal Point will follow the limitations
indicated below in describing sources for the United Nations
Environment Program International Referral System Directory.
Sources are requested to deﬁne themselves and their services as
accurately as possible using only those descriptors which are
vital, but not exceeding the indicated maximum.

Directory those Federal, State and Local, business and indus-
trial, university and other organizational sources which are ca-
pable and willing to reply fully to requests from foreign users.

 

 




 

IV. THE U. S. NATIONAL DIRECTORY
A. Policy

The U. S. National Focal Point will establish and maintain a
national directory of sources of environmental information in
addition to the International Directory of Sources.

The National Directory will contain all sources which have
environmental information and are willing and able to reply to
questions from United Nations Environment Program Inter-
national Referral System users.

Dear Colleague:

Reference is made to Mr. Mollenhauer's letter of 28th October 1976 con—
cerning the possibility of including the NGO Environment Liaison Centre's Profile
Survey of your organization into the first International Directory of UNEP's
International Referral System. Your "IRS record" was obtained by specialized
indexing from information contained in your profile survey questionnaire, and the
supporting documentation you had provided.

Our intentions were, of course, simultaneously communicated to IRS National
Focal Points of our partner Governments. The National Focal Point in your country
has informed us that (a) your organization has already been formally registered into
IRS, or (b) such registration is in progress, or (c) it is their preference that the
joint project effort of UNER/ELC not be used as a method of IRS registration since
although expeditious, it in fact lacks important features of the IRS design.

As the focal points who have so communicated to IRS are among our most active
and most capable partners, there is no reason to doubt that if (a) or (b) above do
not pertain, that (c) will soon be implemented and your organization will properly
appear in a subsequent (quarterly) issue of the directory. Should, for some reason,
you not be contacted in the near future by your IRS National Focal Point, we
suggest that you contact them and offer your potential as sources of environmental
information. Your IRS National Focal Point is:

important activity. *
