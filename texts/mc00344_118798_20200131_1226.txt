To Humanitarians in New Jersey:

WHY HASN'T THE WILD BIRD BILL COME UP FOR A VOTE? As you
know, A. 2332, introduced by Assemblyman D. Bennett Mazur,
was approved by the Assembly Committee last year.
Unfortunately, the Speaker of the Assembly has not yet posted
the bill for a Floor vote. Until A. 2332 is passed, poachers
and smugglers will continue to send the beautiful birds they
capture illegally into New Jersey for sale to the public.

Blease write to.the Speaker of the Assembly requesting him to

post A. 2332 for a vote. He may be addressed as follows:

Hon. Charles Hardwick

Speaker of the Assembly

203 Elm Street

Westfield, New Jersey 07090

Please write. too. to your Assemblyman gr.A§semblwaman.
Even if you have written them previously, new ie the time Le
write again. They can help by asking Speaker Hardwick to
post the bill. Remind them that capture of parrots, mynahs,
finches, and many other beautiful birds causes such terror
and severe injury to them that mortality, even before export
from their native lands, averages 45%-60%.

A. 2332 would ban the sale of wild-caught exotic birds in New
Jersey. A similar law was enacted in New York State in 1984.
It has long been illegal to capture our own native birds and
sell them. We should respect the laws of other countries in
the same way. Many birds are caught illegally in their
native countries and trans—shipped through Belgium and The
Netherlands. 0thers--officials estimate up to 50,000 a
year-~are smuggled into this country from Mexico. Many die,
and many carry diseases that endanger our native birds and
poultry. '

If you would like additional information on mortality in the
exotic bird trade, let us know. We can send you a free copy

of an Animal Welfare Institute Quarterly. If you wish, we

can also send you a copy of the Environmental Investigation
Agency's The Trade ie Live Wildlife, Mortality and Trensport
Conditions (price: $3.00).

We will be glad to send you extra copies of this letter to
give to neighbors and friends, for it's important now that

 




letters reach New Jersey legislators.

We are grateful to you for helping to preserve wild birds in
their native lands and preventing the atrocious cruelty
associated with the commercial trade. Your efforts will help
to make New Jersey the second state to enact this important
legislation. New York's Wild Bird Act survived the attempts
of the pet industry to nullify it. Now it is showing its
effectiveness in ending commercial exploitation of
wild—caught exotic birds.

THANKS FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE, and best wishes for the holidays!

Sincerely,

Madeleine Bemelmans Christine Stevens
President Secretary

Dear Ms. Bemelmans:

Thank you for your letter of February 29 regarding
Assembly Bill 694.

I supported A—69A in the past and will continue to do
so. However, I have checked the list of bills assigned to
the Conservation, Natural Resources and Energy Committee
and do not see A-694. I have learned that it is in the
Economic Growth, Agriculture and Tourism Committee. Thus,
I suggest you write to Assemblyman Mazur requesting its
release. His address is:

The Honorable D. Bennett Mazur
448 Main Street
Fort Lee, New Jersey 07024

Thank you for contacting my Office on an issue that is
of great importance to you.

Sincerely,

To Humanitarians New Jersey:

Good news on the wild bird bill! Speaker Chuck Hardwick has
written us saying, "please be assured that this issue will be
given my full consideration when the bill is considered
during the new session." The bill is identical to the one we
wrote you about last year. Its new number is A—694.

The bill is going to be scheduled soon in the Conservation
Natural Resources and Energy Committee whose Chairperson
Maureen Ogden has been a strong supporter of the wild bird
bill. There are some new committee members who are less
familiar with the legislation. So please write to each, and
thank Assemblywoman Ogden for her dedicated concern.

Assemblyman Gerald Naples District 15;

2nd Floor

Trenton, NJ 08609

It is'important that you writeftoo to your Assemblyman or
Assemblywoman NOW urging support ﬁg; A—624 to end commercial
sale 9: wild caught exotic birds. Please explain that under
the provisions of the bill pet shOps can continue to sell pet

 

(over)

 




birds bred in captivity. The vital difference is that the
terrible cruelty, suffering and death involved in the wild
bird trade will be eliminated if A-694 is enacted into law.
Let your legislators know the facts: approximately twenty
million birds are captured for sale every year in Senegal
alone, but they are so roughly handled and subjected to such
mistreatment that half are dead even before they are loaded
on planes to the United StatesL Europe and Japan.

SUCH MASSIVE SUFFERING CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. It
cannot be justified in any way. Only the greed of the pet
industry keeps the trade alive. The laws of many countries,
where the beautifully colored exotic birds live, prohibit
their export, but they are smuggled out anyway.

Recently a ring of bird smugglers operating between Mexico,
California and Louisiana were caught and fined. One received
a two—year prison sentence, but all too often the poachers
and smugglers continue their heartless crimes undetected, and
they have no difficulty in selling their unfortunate
victims——at least those that survive. The enclosed

photographs show their suffering more clearly than any words
can do.

So please d9 all you can to see that A-694 is passed. Thanks!

Sincerely,

W WW Cami/:0.
