Dear Tom,

It was good to speak with you last week and to hear that you
are still nurturing "large press" possibilities for SPRINGING
THE TRAPS. I looked over the manuscript again tonight and
think it's an original and important collection. I hope
we'll be able to bring it out soon in this new decade.

I've divided up the species we're still searching for and am
sending you half the missing critters. The Granger's

Poetry Index search is laborious, and involves some guessing,
but I think it's the most direct way to fill the gaps. Your
library may very well have many of the sources cited in
Granger's, like the New Oxford Book of Canadian Verse (1982),
which looks promising for a beaver, or John Gill's

New American and Canadian Poetry (1971), which should have a
suitable panda poem. The only animal I didn't find an entry
for in Granger's is the manatee. I've put several poet friends
on alert for that one, but it would be good if you also kept
an eye out for one.

 

 

While choosing animal poems to read at our Bethlehem Earth Day
celebration, I've been wishing our book were already

available to share with others. I imagine we'll both get
moving on it after June lO——but hardly much sooner!

All success to you and Nancy in changing the world, which
you are doing!

Warm good wishes,

 

Jean Pearson




  

l9 JUNE 1990

 
 

JEAN:

THIS IS A FIRST ROUGH-GO AT WHAT WE MIGHT SEND. I HAVE NO
EGO-INVOLVEMENT IN THIS, SO MAKE ANY CHANGES YOU LIKE. THEN SEND
IT BACK, I'LL HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT, AND WE CAN MOVE ALONG
FROM THERE. HOPEFULLY, NOW THAT THE MARCH IS BEHIND US, I'LL BE
ABLE TO SPEND SOME TIME ON SOME OTHER PROJECTS, WITH THIS ONE AT
(OR NEAR) THE TOP!

TAKE CARE.

YOURS IN THE STRUGGLE —
K

M...—

 

P.S. I'VE CHANGED THE TITLE SOMEWHAT, I KNOW, BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE
THE EMPHASIS ON CONTEMPORARY MIGHT BE USEFUL. BUT, AGAIN, I'M
AMENABLE KEEPING IT THE WAY IT WAS.

Dear xx:

Springing the Traps: Contemporary Poetry in Celebation of Animals fills
an important gap in the growing body of work relating to humanity's
reconsideration of the other animals with whom we share the Earth.

Philosophers were among the first of our contemporaries to begin the
process of reconsideration, and it is now widely acknowledged that
contemporary philosophers have written more on this matter during the
past twenty years than their predecessors had written in. the previous
two thousand. Theologians, too, have added their voice, as have legal
theorists, for example. In each of'these fields, it is now possible to
make use of well conceived and accessible anthologies.

Until quite recently, poets and writers of fiction, while they have not
been silent as individuals, have not spoken as a group, in appropriate
anthologies. Things are beginning to change.

In 1988 Andrew Linzey and Tom Regan published Song of Creation: An
Anthology of Poems in Praise of Animals (U.K.: Marshall-Pickering; US:
University of Illinois [pending]). In addition, Linzey and Regan have a

second volume, this one of short stories and excerpts from novels, that
has been accepted for publication (UK: Duckworth; U.S.: Crossroads). A

 
   




2

third book, In the Company of Dogs, edited by Michael Rosen, also a
collection of fiction, will be published later this year. All indications
are, these recent books are the early signs of a significant trend in the
publishing industry.

The market for these books is real enough. In its 1989 cover story on
the animal rights movement, Newsweek magazine estimated the size of
the movement at lO million-~and growing. Moreover, the
"reconsideration of the other animals," mentioned at the outset,
increasingly is explored in high school and college level courses. There
is, then, a large potential market, comprised of a significant sectre of
the general public and of classroom educators.

If Springing the Traps duplicated what has appeared to date, it would
have little to recommend it. But this book differs from others, first,
because, unlike Rosen's and one of the Linzey/Regan books, this one is a
collection of poetry,- second, because, unlike the Linzey/Regan poetry
anthology, this one is a collection of work by contemporary poets; and,
third, because of the novel way in which the poems are grouped, as
reflected in the Table of Contents.

Far and away the strongest reason for publishing this collection of

contemporary poetry, however, is the great strength of the collection
itself. From the opening poem by Robert Gibb to Denise Levertov's
celebration of pighood and Robert Bly's protestation at the death of a
seal, the poetry is uniformly excellent, poem by poem, and a real bench
mark anthology, considered as a group. Here, truly--or so we
believe--the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

Those "parts” are not quite complete. Certain animals, who should be
the focus of a poem, presently are unrepresented. There are also-
copyright matters to be finalizeu. incomplete thoughi’the anthology is,
we believe that its ultimate strength, and the significant potential
market, are evident. We hope you agree.

Looking forward to your response, we are,

Yours sincerely,

July 11, 1991

Dear Tom,

I've read through your new batch of animal poems with delight!
You've found a number of fine poets and poems I hadn't known
before. I think we're nearly done, and you have certainly
done your share of the research. I will integrate what seems
appropriate from your new additions into the Table of
Contents. I'm still hunting for good poems on the elephant
and the manatee, but I think the ms. could go into
circulation without them.

Just a few thoughts about our collection: if we call it
"Contemporary Poetry in Celebration of Animals," I lean toward
omitting D. H. Lawrence and others no longer living. That would

 

also serve to distinguish our book from its nearest kin——We Animals)
edited by Nadya Aisenberg (Sierra Club Books, 1989). I

enclose the cover and the concluding essay of her book for

your perusal. While we include a handful of the same poets

she uses——Bly, Levertov, Wendell Berry, et al.——we have

no overlapping poems. Another distinction we can point to is
that all our poems are in the original English——no translations.

And then I think our focus is different from hers. Whereas

she looks to animals largely to teach us about ourselves, we
focus more on the intrinsic identity and value of the
individual animal or species. That may not be the best

selling point for most publishers. But perhaps a philosopher
like yourself can find the persuasive moral argument for

that idea. Finally, I think our emphasis is on our humane
sense of stewardship and responsibility toward the animal
creation and on poetry's capacity to awaken empathy to the
vital needs of animals, whose future lies so much in our hands.
So that we do not represent the humanist approach I find in
Aisenberg's anthology, but a more_eggcentric View of the value
of animal lives. And, of course, we have our unique grouping
of the poems according to place or habitat, which also reflects
an ecological consciousness of the interrelatedness of person
and place.

I guess one of my deepest hopes for this anthology (and perhaps
the strongest reason behind our choice of poems) is that it
might nurture the perception of animals as persons, With all
that this implies for granting them rights and treating them
fairly. How loudly one can say this to an editor, I'm sure you
can judge much better than I.

In case it's of use to you, I'm encosing my updated "animal
poet" bio—note. Also enclosed is a copy of the letter you sent
me a year ago as a sample letter to a publisher. I think it's
very fine as is. I don't know whether it's wise to point to

the Nadya Aisenberg anthology in a cover letter. The only thing

 




 

that might need revising in light of the Aisenberg anthology
is the second full paragraph on page 2 of your letter, since
at first glance our work might seem to duplicate We Animals.

My recollection of our conversation of June 8 is that you asked
me not to take any further steps to find a publisher until you
were ready to approach your editor at University of Illinois
with our anthology. That's fine with me, especially if you've
already mentioned our collection to him. But would it hurt

to sound out Harper and Row or Doubleday anyhow? HarperCollins
(the San Francisco division of Harper and Row that specializes
in religious books) sold out the anthology Earth Prayers (which
included my poem "A Daily Prayer for the Poisoned, the Blinded,
the Trapped...") in two months! They might be enthusiastic to
follow that volume up with one for the animals, even though they
don't usually do poetry. I won't take any action until I hear
from you. I don't want to add unnecessary pressure or jeopardize
a good contact you've already made.

We just celebrated my mother's 77th birthday this evening,
and my Dogga turned 15 in May, the oldest Kuvasz now living
in the United States! Except for the frailties and
limitations of old age, life is good here.

Our warmest greetings to you and Nancy!

As ever,
um

Jean Pearson's poems of animals and the green world have.

appeared in The American Poetry Review, Milkweed Chronicle,

 

The Christian Science Monitor, Organic Gardening, and The
Animals' Agenda. Her collection On Speaking Terms with Earth
was published in 1988 by Great Elm Press and her translations
from the Swedish are forthcoming this year from White Pine
Press as the book Elemental Poems. Her poetry has recently

appeared in the HarperCollins anthology Earth Prayers and

 

in the special "animal" issue of the Canadian ecology journal

The Trumpeter. Her essay "Among Wolves" is included in And

a Deer's Ear, Eagle's Song and Bear's Grace, an anthology
published by Cleis Press that celebrates the relationships
between animals and women. Pearson's work expresses an
"I—Thou” attitude of equality between species and reflects
her philosophy of reverence for all life. In June of 1990
she was the featured poet at the national March for the

Animals in Washington, DC. She is listed in A Directory of

 

American Poets and Fiction Writers and Who's Who in Writers,

 

Editors, and Poets.

March 10, 1992

Dear Tom,

So happy to have this together at last! Finished the Table
of Contents this morning at 2 a.m. Enclosed are 30 new poems
you haven't seen plus a couple that were listed on the old T
of C but which I couldn't remember having sent you. Also
added to the previous T of C are 12 poems from the batch you
sent me last year, which I presume you have copies of. Let
me know if you need any of the following (of those you sent
me in 1991):

Babette Deutsch Ape
Ted Hughes Song of a Rat (would part II. of this poem
be good for the Farm section?)

May Sarton Eine Kleine Snailmusik '
The Swans

Denise Levertov To the Snake

Randall Jarrell The Chipmunk's Day
Bats

Isak Dinesen Zebra

Charles Edward Eaton Lizard

David Constantine Watching for Dolphins

Stephen Dunn Letting the Puma Go

Joyce Carol Oates The Mountain Lion

As far as I'm concerned, this is now a remarkably solid and
spine—tingling collection, thorough and balanced, even

though I had to give up the idea of representing every major
species. If we can get permission to use all the famous poets
we've added, the book will be a fine balance between well—known
and lesser known poets.

I've taken out a few poems from the previous T of C, such as
Updike's Dog poem, for reasons too elaborate to go into here.
But if anything you feel strongly about has been dropped,
let's discuss it.

I've also added too many poems of my own, because I've lost
objectivity! I would like to be represented with 4—5 poems.

The two I feel most strongly about are "Paradise Key" and

"Saint Francis and the Wolf." The one I have grave doubts

about is "Ancient Justice"-—I read it at the March for the
Animals and many people requested a copy, but it may be
potentially libelous. Would you please help me decide on that
one, as well as "Land Mine," "Children of the Tides," "The Comet
at Equinox," and "A Daily Prayer"?

The new organization of the T of C reflects a better flow
and variety and juxtaposition of poems than before. Again,
if you're missing anything, let me know.

 




In addition to a general introduction, I think it would be
a good idea for us, once we know who the publisher will be,
to write brief intros to each section, as has been done in
the poetry anthology Earth Prayers.

 

If you don't get a favorable response from Stillpoint, we can
try Harper/Collins, which encouraged me to send in the ms.,
though I don't have an individual contact there. There are
several promising possibilities.

It was inspiring to hear you last week at Lafayette. I think
the tone of your lecture was on a par with Schweitzer's
ability to inspire——what "higher? education is meant to be.

Love to you and Nancy and your canine pals,

to I’m

CONCERNING THE CONTENTS

1- IT SEEMS TO ME WE WOULD DO WELL TO BEGIN THE
ANTHOLOGY WITH POSITIVE LIFE-AFFIRMNG POETRY AND
WORK OUR WAY TOWARDS THE POETRY OF DOMNATION AND
LIBERATION. THAT WAY THE ANTHOLOGY DRAWS ONE IN—AND
ALSO HELPS PREPARE A POETIC PATH TO THE SENSE OF
OUTRAGE WE HOPE READERS WILL FEEL IN RESPONSE TO THE
LIFE—NEGATING WAYS IN WHICH ANIMAIS ARE TREATED. FOR
THESE REASONS I THINK THE SECTION ON 'COMPANIONS'
WORKS BEST AS THE OPENING SECTION.

7. THE SECTION 'THE OLD FARM' DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.
SONIE OF THE POEMS INVOLVE GRATUITOUS DEATH AT HUMAN
HANDS, FOREXALAPLE, AND EVENWHILE THE VENERABLE WAGE
OF THE 'FAMILY FARM IS SOFTER THAN FACTORY FARMS, TD
LIKE TO SUGGIET WE DO SOME REVISIONISTIC TINKERING AND
PUT SOME OF THE BEST OF THE 'FARM' POEMS IN THE SECTION
ON 'CONIPANIONS' AND OTHERS ELSEWHERE, AS PER THE

REVISED TABLE OF CONTENTS I'M ENCLOSING.

3. WITHIN 'COMPANIONS' I SUGGEST WE CONSIDER SOME
FURTHER CHANGES. WHY NOT PUT THE POEMS ABOUT
STILL—ALIVE DOGS AND CATS (ROVER, TO BROTHER, THE COMET
AT EQUINOX, ARRANGEMENTS, THE ATTRACTION OF
HOUSECATS, SPARROWHAWK FOR SQUIDDY) AT THE
BEGINNING IN THAT ORDER AND THE POEMS ABOUT DEATH
(NOT A DEADMOUSE POEM THE KI'I'TEN, THE CAT'S DEATH,
BROWN, SMALL ESTATE, LAMENT FOR AURIC, OLD DOG) AT THE
END, WITH THE 'FARIVI' POEMS IN BETWEEN? THIS HAS A 'NICE‘
FEEL TO ME, I-SPECIALLY WITH ONE STAFFORD POEM AT THE
BEGINNING, THE OTHER AT THE END. I SUGGEST A FEW OTHER,
MINOR REARRANGEMENTS IN THIS SECTION, AS PER THE
REVISED CONTENTS. BY THE WAY, ITS NOT CLEAR TO NIE THAT
'THE NIGHT VEI' FITS WELL

4. I SUGGEST WE RETITLE 'PART OF THE GARDEN.‘ 'PART' SEEMS
(HOW SHALL I SAY?) REDUCTIONIS'T. WHAT ABOUT 'IN THE
GARDEN'? TWO OF THE PEOMS (THE BABY BIRDS, EINE KLEINE
SNAIIMUSIK) SEEM A BIT 'CUTESY' TO RAE—BELOW THE
STANDARD OTHERS MEET, DON'T YOU THINK? ALSO, I SUGGET
A MORE CONSISTENT ORDERING (INSECTS TOGETHER, BIRDS

 




  

2

 
 
  

TOGEI'HER, ETC.) ONE POSSIBILITY: SLUGS, EVENING DANCE OF
THE GREY FLIES, MONARCH, POST PARTUM, DAUGHTERS WITH
TOAD, THE SEED—EATERS, SCRUB ]AYS, WINTER HUMMINGBIRD,
THE CHIPMUNK'S DAY, MOLES, SKUNK, TO THE SNAKE OTHER
CHANGES EMERGE IN THE CONTENTS.

   
  
  
 
  
  
 
   
   
  
  
  
 

5. TVE TINKERED WI'I'H THE 'IN THE WILD' SECI'ION. I SUGGIST
WEBREAKTHE'IN THE--.," 'ON THE--.'TITLESATTHIS POINT,
SINCE WE CAN'T SUSTAIN THEM WELL I THINK 'O'THER
NATIONS' IS THE TITLE I SUGGEST.

6. I REALIZE THAT SONIE OF THE POENIS IN THE NEXT SECTION
CONCERN VISIONS AND LEGENDS, IN SOME SENSE, BUT
SONIETHING LIKE 'DREAMSCAPES' IS CRISP AND SUGGES'I'IVE.

 

7. I'VE RECASTAND REVISED WHAT USED TO BE THE 'TRAPS'
SECTION, CREATING 'IWO DIFFERENT THEMATIC SUBSEC—
TIONS—ONE CALLED 'DOMINATION,' THE OTHER 'PROTEC—
TION.‘ I THINK BREAKING THINGS UP THIS WAY WORKS BETTER

8. SOME MARGINAL POEMS ]UST DON'T SEEM TO WORK WELI.
ANYWHERE; AFEWIUST DON'T SEEM'I'O BE UPTOTHE
STANDARDS SETBYTIIE OTHERS IN'I'HE BOOK BUT'THEREISA
BATCH OF GOOD POEM THAT I WISH FIT SOMEWHERE,
WI'I'HOUTA STRUGGLE MAYBE YOU CAN FIND A PROPER HONIE
FOR THEM

 
   
  

  

9. SOME SECTIONS ARE MUCH LONGER THAN OTHERS.
SOLAETHING IN ME WOULD LIKE TO SEE A MORE EVENLY
DISTRIBUTED STRUCTURE BUT I DON;T THINK WE SHOULD
FORCE A SENSE OF ARITHEMETIC PROPORTION ON THE POEMS
AS WE ENDEAVOR TO LET THEN! SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.

 
    
    
 

‘10. ALL THE ABOVE, AGAIN, BY WAY OF SUGGESTION ONLY. TM
OPEN FOR ANY AND ALL SUGGlBTIONS ON YOUR PART.

    
 

11- ALI. CONSIDERED, A VERY GOOD COLLECTION, IN MY VIEW. A
REAL LANDMARK VOLUNIE, TD SAY.

 
   




 

I think Steve's AIpha Centhri is one of the strongest,

 

 
   
  
    
 
  
 
 
   
   
  
  
  
   
    
  
    
   
    
  
  
  

most reaIistic vegetarian poems I've seen. I think we can
accept it for "Springing the Traps." Somehow I didn't Iike
the Stephen Dobyns' poem, "White Pig." Of course it's weII

written and Dobyns is getting to be quite weII—known, but I
didn't Iike the sensationaIist feeIing of it, even though it
makes its point. One of our intentions in the anthoIogy

is to emphasize compassionate action on behaIf of animaIs, and
this poem just seems to enjoy aII the vioIence too much.
What's your reaction to it? Corso's "The Mad Yak' is o.k.
but it didn't exactIy Iead me to any epiphanies. ActuaIIy,
it sounds Iike a transIation to me. As for the other two
poems by Kowit, which you Ieft with me on your visit Iast
ApriI, I Iike his ”Portrait of WaIt Whitman & ButterfIy,"
but I feeI it beIongs more appropriater in the WaIt Whibﬁmn
journaI than in our anthoIogy. At Ieast it's more
"Iiterary" than anything eIse we have. StiII it's a fine
poem, and if you don't mind I'd Iike to send it on to Geoff
SiII at MickIe Street Review and recommend they puinsh it
there. ShaII I write to Steve Kowit about this? The other
probIem I see with his Whitman poem and with his ”The AnimaI
Poem" is Iine Iength. Some of his Iines are more than 80
characters Iongll I'm not surehhe format of our book (as
yet undecided) couId accomodate Iines of that Iength. I
Iike his poetry very much and I Iike what he's saying in
"The AnimaI Poem," but I'm not sure about the form. My
impression right now is it's too Iong for us. StiII, he's a
vaIuabIe contact to have and I was very gIad you encouraged
him to send whatever eIse he finds appropriate.

Those are my thoughts for now. Say yes to”AIpha
CenEurivbut no to the others. ShaII I write to him? Just
teII me if you agree with the decision. Signing off on this
evening of the Winter SoIstice. Many bIessings and good

vibes!

i

     

FeeI free to send this on to Steve by way of an answer,
if you agree!

Bethlehem native Jean Pearson is a teacher, translator
and eiﬁtor of The Mickie Street Review’s ”Whitman and the
Eart issue. Her poems have appeared in Milkweed Chroni-
cle, The American Poetry Review and The Mickie Street Re-
vrew. .

. l was born and grew up in Bethlehem and have known names
like Monocacy and Lehigh, M'nsi Trail and Mauch Chunk for as long
as I can remember. it was only a few years ago, however, that I be-
gan to recognize these words as Indian place names. I've been
walking the Monocacy Creek since I was 5 years old, and that
stream has become a metaphor in my poetry for my own lilie, for
the life of the place I live in. physically and imaginatively.

Through my poems I want to create an empathy with the natu-

. ral world and its creatures, humans included. Part of this desire has
led me "to go deeper than Bethlehem in my native place" in order
to find my bonds to the first people who lived in this area —- the
Lenape lndians. Some of my poems evoke the consciousness of
those humans who lived in the Lehigh Valley before Europeans set-
tled here — the consciousness of a much closer relationship be-
’ tween humans, animals, and land than we now acknowledge.

Maybe the spirits of the ancient Lenape still live here. When I '
shift into "Lenape" consciousness, a lot of creatures come back to
the land along the Monocacy -- black bear, snapping turtles, wild
turkeys, a white heron, a timber wolf now and then. That's the rich-
er world I would like to be able to move in here. More wildlife all
around and fewer fur coats and Burger Kings!

Favorite writer: Poet and Zionsville resident Robert Gibb.

Writes Pearson: ”His poems in 'T he Names of the Earth in
Summer, ’ a memorably beautiful book, are deeply identiﬁed
with the nature of this region and express life in this place on
the planet with more intensity and knowledge and sensitivity
than anything else I’ve read. Gibb ’5 work obviously springs
from a deep e "ml awareness and from a sense-of the
tragic in human 5 as well. ”

P.O. Box 417
BethIehem, PA 18016
December 22. 1987

Dear Tom,

I was very gIad to get your Ietter with
encIosures from Steve Kowit today. I was wondering
what had become of you! I haven't heard from you since
your phone caII some weeks before the Animals
Conference in Sept. and I've received nothing in the
maiI from you--no poems--since our meeting on
"Springing the Traps" here in BethIehem 1ast ApriI.
Have you sent me any materiaI since then? I hope
nothing's been Iost in the maiI!

I sent you two new batches of poems this
faII, some 20 pages in a1]. I hope you received them.
If not, Iet me know. I've been waiting for your
responses to the second batch before sending you more
materiaI. (You did teII me your reaction to MaryﬂLa
Vaiette's work when you caIIed in Sept.--her poems were
in the first batch). It wouId be good for us both to
briefIy acknowIedge receipt of materiaI sent from now
on, so we know where things stand.

I assume your scheduIe has been very busy, as
mine has, with severaI projects taking shape
simuItaneoust. My revisions on my Kusenberg book are
nearIy done. Next I have two Iong essays to write for
a reference work on NobeI Prize Laureates. Great EIm
Press wants to bring out a smaII book of my poems and
I'm eager to have that out by March when I'm scheduIed
to give 6 poetry readings, appear at the NiIdwood
Poetry Conference (whose director sent us a Iong poem
on "Adam Naming the AnimaIs"—-which I asked you for a
@3153 response on some months ago!—-just a prompt), and
I have severaI 1ecture appearances in March, too, so my
time is pretty fuIIy booked untiI sometime in ApriI.
And I reaIize that you must be 10 times more heavin in
demand than I am.

I've been investigating severaI forms of book
production and have Iocated a very cheap typesetter and
a few higth recommended printers/binders. So far I've
reviewed and responded to submissions from nearIy 500
peopIe who answered the announcement of our anthoIogy
in Poets & Writers and the many other poetry
newsIetters which carried our ad. I stiII have about

 




 

 

 

90 mss. to reread and decide on. You are, I assume,
going to write for permission to reprint those already
published poems of the well-known poets we've
collected—-anything that we've photocopied from a
book--like Stafford, Gibb, Kinnell, Bly, Mary Oliver.

I suggest we have a final meeting over the poems
we're holding—-in April or May--either here or in
Philly or you name it. I could try to squeeze in a
meeting at the very end of February, if that's more
convenient for you. Let's plan to make our final
choices then, and the decisions on producing the book,
and get this project moving! As you may know, there
are two anthologies in the works now, both on Women and
Animals, which are probably going to appear in 1989.

So I really hope we can get ours out well before those.

I'd also like to know what Galway Kinnell did at
the Animals Conference. I was sorry not to hear from
you about how that event went. But very glad to hear
from you now!!!! I've finally made a little concession
in the direction of ComputerWorld. Though I still
prefer penmanship, letterpress, illustrated
manuscripts. The craft of the hand rather than the
machine. My Mother has just gone off to our relatives
in Conn. to celebrate Christmas; since I have to get
done with these revisions, I'm staying here with the

animals. All is relatively calm and bright here. It's
been a good year personally. I'm thankful. More
people in my immediate environment have stopped eating
animals. Small reasons to rejoice.

May you and Nancy and you children have a very
full and happy holiday, wherever you go. We'll
communicate again in the New Year!

Warm Wishes,

E’Z .E ,2 1

Jean Pearson

From the Artist. . .
Barbara Stone

l spent my first twenty years in Rockford, lllinois
where I enjoyed extended visits to my grand-
mother's farm. There a special family sharing was
exchanged during the holidays. These elements of
my time there form a basis for the peaceful and
sometimes extraordinary images in my drawings.

My home for the last eleven years has been the
Colorado plains with their dramatically changing
view of the Rockies. I share this joyfully and grate-
fully with my daughter, Angeline. Awe for such
beauty and for the many subtleties realized when
growing in love/life is a universal feeling I wish to
relate in my work.

I've chosen the polar bear to symbolize the point
of View of an inner observer—white at the center
of color. Perhaps your imagination may be chal—
lenged when confronted with my gentle, docile.

pastel polar bears.

Dear Tom,

Here are all the poems-—Yes£ES and Maybes all humbled
together——that we are now considering for SPRINGING THE
TRAPS. I'm working under a Sept. 30 deadline for my
Kusenberg ms. In October I'll put together a tentative
order for our anthology and do a table of contents. Till
then, we can both be on the lookout for a few more poems by
major authors. Since Joyce Carol Oates is on CAF's advisory
board it would be nice to represent her in the collection.

I remember I didn't care for her "Fireflies" poem. Do you
think she would be willing to write an original piece on

the title theme? Also something by Gary Snyder should be
here. I believe he's a strong animal person, and he's the
only major voice among contemporary natural world poets we
haven't included. Maybe his "Smokey the Bear Sutra" or some
of his shorter poems from Axe Handles. I'll look for
something.

 

It was good to see you here. I'm impressed with your new
video and will urge LV-ARK to purchase a copy. Now I look
forward to meeting Andrew Linzey at our program for DCTV in
NYC. My mother sends you her warm wishes. Please give
Nancy my best. I was intrigued to learn what goes on behind
the scenes at our little ABE airport. Take care and have a
prosperous rest of the summer! ,

All Best,

QFE/W

Dear Arielle:

Herewith some information about the poetry project I mentioned to you. This
project has dragged on for, oh, I'd say maybe three years.The thing about it is, it's a
great project. At least I think it is. But, alas, it always seems to make its way toward
the bottom of my pile. So, I turn to you.

ﬂ: —— and this is Leg; important to me —— I would not want you to help out if doing

this sort of thing isn't of any interest to you. I mean it. I am sure I can find someone
else to help, so please do not feel "pressured" into doing anything. Q11); if you find

this sort of research /detective work interesting should you agree to do it.

Anyhow, here's what's what.

Notice, ﬁrst, the Table of Contents [marked ITEM #1] for the anthology. Then note
[ITEM #2] the gaps we have, referred to as "species still needed" Finally, find ITEM
#3, a xerox of the resource one needs to use, Granger's Index to Poetry. along with
some sample pages from this Index. As you'll see, one can look for a poem about
lions, for example, by keying off either the title _o_r_ the first line. '

And so it goes, for each of this missing species (beaver, eagle, etc.). That's the first
step.

The second step is to track down the actual poems. Having never gone this route
myself, I simply don't know how difﬁcult or time consuming this might prove to
be. However, perhaps the burden could be lightened somewhat by making
"educated guesses" about which poems to eliminate. I just don't know. I think one
discovers the path as one moves alont it.

And what do you get in return for your help, should you find the offer interesting
enough to accept? First, an expression of thanks -- in print, mind you -- for your
assistance; and second, three -— count them: not one, not two, but three —— copies of
the book, when it's published, which is not bad when you consider that authors
receive a maximum of ten.

So, there you have it. If it sounds fun/intriguing/challenging, then let's talk about
how you might proceed. If not, not. The one thing that seems clear to me is, you
shouldn't do it if you don't have a love for poetry.

Let me know, when you decide.

With every good wish, and thanking you for everything you've done already, I am,

Yours in The Struggle — /-———\
