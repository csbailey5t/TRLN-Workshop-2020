Dear Miss de la Roche,

Thank you for sending me the coPy of "Cats in Focus“. I look
forward to reading it carefully when my present very crowded
schedule becomes a little more reasonable.

Unfortunately, I have no direct contacts with publishers in
this country. There is a relatively small, privately owned
company here in Washington that is trying to broaden their

list, so I think an exploratory letter would be well worthwhile.
It is The Acr0polis Books, Ltd., Alfred Hackl, President,

I certainly wish ygu well in your search for a wider audience.

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens,

SZASZ REVEALS HOW AND WHY MAN IS BECOMING OBSESSED WITH PETS
IN PROB ING EXAMINATION OF AN ALARMING SOCIAL PHENOMENON

”In its depth of inquiry, her book is astounding-

we haven't seen its like. "
Publishers' Weekly

Kathleen Szasz is a lover of animals. She also cares deeply for human be-
ings, and it is out of this dual concern that she has written PFTS‘HISM_':P_’ets
and their Peeple in the Western World, a volume that attacks not pets but
profitmakers who gross several billion dollars a year from a society in-
creasingly obsessed with pets as pacifiers in an age of anxiety.

". . . there is something frightening, something threatening,
in the speed with which the cult of pet animals has gained
ground throughout the Western World in the last decade or
so. " notes Mrs. Szasz. "It seems as if, by anthrOpomorphizing
the animals he takes into his home and gradually replacing
his human contacts with animals, man were trying to escape
into an other-than-human community, a community that he
can control and that, therefore, does not threaten his very
existence. There are fewer and fewer peOple left to love
animals as animals, with an affection born of curiosity, the
appreciation of their differentness and often beauty, and a
childlike and uncorruptedly human enjoyment of watching
them in their natural state. "

 

Traveling throughout the United States and EurOpe, Mrs. Szasz investigated
many varying aspects of man's relationship to domestic animals in an effort
to understand man’s present dilemma. Beginning with a short and often sur-
prising history of pet keeping, the author goes on to report many new develoP-
ments on the positive side including the utilization of animals in child psycho-
therapy, education of the mentally and physically handicapped and rehabilita-
tion of the aged and the criminal by the use of pets.

Less healthy, however, are those areas in which the anthr0pomorphizing of
pet animals is a symptom of man's inability to relate directly to his fellow
man. Mrs. Szasz finds instances of this steadily increasing and cites as
examples the use of pets as emotional surrogates of many kinds, documenting
her volume with a number of unusual case histories.

Turning her attention to the pet industry, the author reveals how big business
is now using its ”hidden persuadersE' to capture the newest consumer - the pet—
practicing every trick of subconscious manipulation to generate a multi—billion
dollar business. From pet greeting cards, cook books, birth control pills and
cosmetics to horosc0pes, and pension and insurance plans and funerals, the
list grows daily as misguided owners endow their animals with human needs
and reward them accordingly.

Recording the slow metamorphis from animal to substitute human that has
taken place over the years, Mrs. Szasz cites growing alienation, affluence,
and leisure as primary causes of this change. While vigorously attacking
those who exploit it, the author's first concern is for a troubled society - a
society that may indeed be shocked by peering into the mirror Mrs. Szasz
has provided.

ABOUT "KATHLEEN SZASZ'S EXTROADINARY BOOK"

The Publishers' Weekly Forecast of PETISHISM:

 

Kathleen Szasz's extraodinary book does what no other book has
done in exposing, psychologically, statistically, from just about
every VieWpoint imaginable, the neurotic cultism practiced by an
enormous number of peOple whose obsessive ”love" for their

animal pets has become-vdownrightmunhealthytwhen.VitiianftmerelywMr ,, W .

silly. In its depth of inquiry, her book is astounding O-- we haven't
seen its like. The author, a lover of animals and people, traces
the cultism surrounding animal pets from its earliest religious
sources to the present day, when “petishism” is expressed in
terms of complete pet wardrobes (including furs), annuity plans,
fantastic hospitalization fees and a substitution of pet for child.
This strikingly off-beat book not only makes exceptional reading,
but may be hailed to a fare-thee-well by reviewers and a capti-
vated public.

TO: The Press
FROM: Marian Behrman
ABOUT: PETISHISM'by Kathleen Szasz

Following are some excerpts from Mrs. Szasz's volume which we feel might
be of special interest.

 

On health care for pets:

"Seventy-five hundred small-animal hospitals and approximately
10, 000 of the 22, 000 veterinarians look after the well-being of the
nation's pets. The number of animal hosPitals increases nine
times as fast as the number of human hospitals, and as a result
the life span of dogs and cats has doubled in the last two or three
decades. As an American veterinarian said: 'Ninety per cent of
American dogs enjoy better medical care than half the peOple in
the world. ' ”

On advertising tec hnique s:

 

”To turn animals into conscious consumers, America’s Big Brother,
the advertising industry, has invented a new gimmick, the synthetizing
and electrical reproduction of the essential tones and harmonies of the
dOg whistle to be used at the beginning of dog-food commercials on
TV. The sound will be inaudible to most adults, although children
under nine will be able to hear it. Tests have shown that urban middle-
class dogs and alert country dogs react to it with tail wagging, bark-
ing, sometimes even savage growls, but the upper-class dog riding

in a Cadillac and wearing a diamond collar considers himself above
responding to a whistle. Different types of commercials will be
designed to appeal to different types of dOgs, according to breed,

size, and geographical area. "

On pet products:

 

"In addition to the various dog shampoos, deodorants, toilet waters,
and ”His" and “Her" perfumes, the pet-cosmetic industry produces
cream rinses, hair coloring 'that will give a graying pet a young look, '
tints in different shades, silver or gold hair sprays for the evening,

a dozen shades of nail polish for day and evening wear, mascara and
false eyelashes for poodles, a spray dentifrice called Happy Breath,
battery-powered vibrating hair and toothbrushes, and many other
cosmetic products used by pe0ple. Syndicated columnist Sylvia Porter
reports that the latest in pet beautification procedures includes face-
lifting. "

On pets as child substitutes:

”One does not quite know whether to laugh, cry, or get angry at adult
persons calling themselves the ’mummy' or 'daddy’ of a poodle, a
Siamese cat, or a baby chimp. Mrs. W. , who has a married son,
is stared at every time she pushes the brand new perambulator,
holding a young chimpanzee, along the street. The animal is being
brought up like a child. He sleeps in his own bed, has a wardrobe
full of clothes and a collection of toys no child in the neighborhood
ever had. He is regularly fed, has his teeth brushed and his hair
combed in the morning, adores television, and often goes with his
'mummy' to the local pub for a glass of orange juice. Mrs. W. is
not an exception, even if a chimp as a child substitute is. "

(MORE)

 




-2-

9n the use of pets in therapy for the mentally or physically handicapped:

”One family bought an aquarium and the spastic child was given

the task of feeding the fish. Within a few Weeks the little girl,

who was fascinated by the fish, had mastered the movements
necessary to Open the package of fishfood, take out the required
amount, and drOp it in the aquarium. A little boy who consistently
refused to use his legS‘becanse he often fell and hurt himself,
achieved wonders when his father bought him a puppy, He forgot
his fears and followed around the little dog from room to room,
stumbling, falling, creeping and, sometimes, walking. In addition
to the progress made, both patients achieved a degree of indepen-
dence, stepped demanding‘constant proof of Iowa from their parents,
and found assurance, pride and happiness in looking after their pets.
Also, the pets helped them greatly in communicating 'arvith their
healthy brothers and sisters because they now had a subject of con-
versation equally interesting to all. ”

“. . . trOpical fish aquaria in hospitals, particularly mental institutions, '
cut down as much as 50 per cent on sedation as a result of their
calming effect. "

On dog -training schools:

“John Behan, head of a dog -training school called Canine College

in Connecticut, has famous peOple like Joan Crawford, Irving Berlin,
Raymond Massey, John D. Rockefeller, and Katherine Cornell among
his clients. He tells of a woman who brought along her small, crippled
dog and asked that he be taught not to bark so she could take him to

the Opera. When the ushers refused to allow even a nonbarking dog

to attend the performance, the lady came back, asking that he be
taught to lie quietly on her shoulder and imitate a fur collar. "

Dear Ms. Bemelmans,

We can never guess what will be important in our lives or how much
we will love someone. ‘When Martin Kosins first met Maya as a puppy
in a pet shop, he didn't even want a dog. But eighteen years
later, when she died in his arms, Martin knew the relationship he
had with Maya was, and would always be, the most significant
relationship of his life.

MAYA‘S FIRST ROSE is the story of the very special love between one
man and his dog. Through her early puppyhood, to frisky
adolescence and years of matronly dignity, to her old age, Martin
and Maya were together and the bond between them grew stronger and
stronger. After her death, Martin decided to put his feelings on
paper and the result is the charming little self—published book I

enclose“

Anyone who has ever loved and lost a pet will find inspiration and
solace in this book. .Already a #1 bestseller in Maya's hometown of
Detroit, we feel it has the potential to become a classic in animal
literature. For those of us who know how important animals are to
people, spiritually and environmentally, Maya serves as an emblem
of the need to preserve the dignity and integrity of the animal
world and as an emblem of the lessons animals can teach us about
ourselves.

 




Villard Books is proud to be publishing MAYA'S FIRST ROSE in
January, 1994. I'm enclosing a copy of the original edition now in
the hopes that you will have time to read it and send back any
comments you may have on it. I've enclosed a self-addressed,
stamped card for just this purpose. Of course, any kind words you

may have would be an enormous help to us in getting this book the
attention we feel it deserves.

I do hope you enjoy MAYA'S FIRST ROSE as much as we have.

All best,

Dear Miss Stevens,

As a member of the Spanish Association for the Defense of Animal
Rights (A.D.D.A.) I have heard of the magnificent job you've been
carrying ahead.

I have always worked for this cause and in the last few years, untill
I have felt seriosly handicaped because of the strain imposed by this
struggle, I have joined and helped all the unification movements made among
European organizations which have publicly denounced cruelty against
animals. But simultaneously I have dedicated a lifetime to a type of anali-
tical work that concerns the points of convergence of the philosophical and
scientific conclusions on life's evolution.

I have resumed this deductive work in the contents of two small
books, the first of which, "Dios, ecologia y panteismo" was translated in
English by Rober Latona and presented by ADDA (in a very limited private

offsett printed edition) to people in all professions who have dedicated
their knowledge and efforts to this cause.

Since the book supports a rational vision of the process of life
which rejects the final conclusions of ecology and ethology and reminds
what biology is supposed to state on behalf of the evolution of animals,
I have allowed myself to send you two copies of this work, hoping you can
eventually find that this exposure is worthwhile to be studied and
spread among the different type of investigators who are willing to help
changing the sad destiny of animals.

Many thanks in advance for lending part of your time to the contents
of this message.

Yours sincerely

Dear Christine,

I trust you got the review copy of Kojces from the Uﬂdergrouna’ which I sent you in January.
I thought you might be interested in two reviews that came ouﬁrecently re: this book.

From the Library Journal

Tobias (Nature ’5 Keepers) introduces the reader to several people on the fore—
front of the ﬁght to free animals from human abuse. Those proﬁled
Nimlude Gene and Lorri Bauston, founders of Farm Animal Sanctuary; Ingrid

Newkirk and Alex Pacheco, founders of People for the Ethical Treatment of

nimals (PETA); Christine Stevens of the Animal Welfare Institute; and animal
liberationist Rod Coronado, who is serving time in prison for illegal activity on
behalf of animals. Here we read about the inhumane conditions on factory farms,
a stockyard industry that condones prolonged suffering of cattle and other
"food" animals, and researchers who perform experiments of questionable
value on nonhuman primates. Tobias examines the choices we have made as a society
that have led us to this institutionalized cruelty against animals. His book is
difﬁcult to read only because it exposes so much suffering. Still, it is essential
for public and college’libraries.—-Peggie Partello, Keene State Coll. Lib., NH

From Booknews

Veteran animal rights campaigner Tobias proﬁles movement leaders on various
fronts and in several organizations. They include the founders of Farm

Animal Sanctuary and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, members
of the Animal Welfare Institute, liberationist Rod Coronado, and several tribal
and religious groups. —Portland, OR (booknewscom)

Reasons to Believe

.7 , - , -' ~ . , 7   ‘ A Journey of Spiritual Awareness in the Modern World
. Rye as 0 HS . by Robert Lefavi, PhD, CHES

to B 1 o _ , 176 pp. ISBN 0-932727-44-1 hardcover $22
I , ' e leve . ' V Dr. Lefavi examines Spirituality vs. Science and the ”Me" Generation, exploring

{gem , ,. why Boomers don't believe. Using both science and scripture, he carefully answers

V V I 1 important questions:

0 How does one go from material-building to spirit-building in the modern world?

0 Can one reconcile a sense of spirituality and God with what contemporary soci-
ety tells us is reality?

0 Is it possible for God to ”exist” today?

Using clarity and simple language and with truth and reconciliation as themes,
Lefavi builds a case for the harmony between belief in God and ”reason." With rea-
sons to believe, he argues, we can see past the thick veil of today's secularism;
only then can we begin a process of spiritual growth, based upon an awareness of
God and God’s continuing role in our lives.

 

No longer do you have to check your brains at the door when entering a church, synagogue or mosque, Lefavi claims. This book
will revolutionize how people today see their faith. As a scientist and former athlete, Bob Lefavi explored his inner knowledge of God
and found harmony between spiritual truths and what the modern world calls "reality." This book is a meticulous account of what
critically-thinking people will encounter when trying to grow as spiritual beings in a world that fails to recognize the spirit.

Perfect to give a young person going off to college or to one questioning a faith which seems to be in conflict with what is being
taught in the schools, this book illustrates that God and our spirituality makes sense. It removes God from "myth" status and gives
us a strong, secure foundation from which we can nurture our faith and sense of spirituality. In so doing, Reasons to Believe gives
people in today's world an inner awareness of the reality of God allowing them to live more joyfully and peacefully.

Dr. Robert Lefavi specializes in the teaching of Spiritual Health in the School of Health Professions at Armstrong
Atlantic State University in Savannah, Georgia. He is the founder of The Oasis Center, a nonprofit research, counsel-
ing and service center in Savannah. Also a consultant to the Federal Trade Commission and the National Council
Against Health Fraud, he has taped a segment for the CBS Evening News with D471 Rather as an expert on drugs and
behavior. His views on this topic have been quoted in the New York Times, USA Today, and Parade. He has provided
expert opinions to attorneys prosecuting violent crimes in which psychoactive drugs may have been used and has
published over 400 articles on health, mental health and spirituality in numerous scientific journals.

Bob Lefavi earned his bachelor of science degree in health science from the University of Florida and his PhD
from Auburn University in Alabama. Currently he is a pastoral counselor at two United Methodist churches and is
pursuing a master of divinity degree at Erskine Seminary, focusing on significantly different topics than he did as a

once-champion weightlifter and record holder. He lives in Guyton, GA with his wife and three children.

Dear Friends! %

Together with this letter you will find an announcement
sheet for the recent publication of my book, MOHAMMSD
WONG SPOUTS!

While it does indicate what the book is about, it does
not mention that there is included an Afterword by Dr.
John C. Lilly of the Human/Dolphin Foundation, titled
"The Rights of Cetaceans Under Human Laws."

 

Indeed, it was Dr. Lilly who supplied me with a list
that included your own organization. In the Author's
Note at the end of the book I listed a dozen groups
devoted to the preservation of whales and other sea
animals, and I make a direct appeal to the reader to
write letters and otherwise lend support in a united
effort to halt the continuing massacre.

The rallying cry is MOHAMMED WONG SPOUTS:

I truly hOpe that there is a way in which you can make
the members of your organization aware of the book, and
that we can all join together in this effort.

To help Spread the word, I am in the process of creating
T shirts and bumper stickers with the message, MOHAMMED
WONG SPOUTS! My hope is to make these available to you
on a cost basis - both for use by your members and/or

to be sold by your members as a means of raising money
for your organization.

You can have full details by drOpping a note to my home
address, which is listed above.

Let's do it this time.
Sincerely,

Robin Sanborn

 




 

MOHAMMED WONG
SPOUTS!

Being an Eyewitness Account
of the Antediluvian Sex Life
of Atlantis and Other Things

From the Hollywood Hills did Calvin
come, and he did leave behind the noxious
city for the solitude of the sea. But of soli-
tude there was none, for soon the head of
a mammoth mandarin whale did break the
sea. And the whale did speak unto Calvin,
and his name was Mohammed Wong. And
of evolution, love, marriage, space Visitors,
politics, businessmen, meditation, ecology,
and Atlantis he did speak much. And,
under the omniscient gaze of the man-
darin’s eye, Calvin did learn. . . .
Philosophy and sex. Mohammed Wong
Spouts! is all that and more! Robin San-
born has written a ﬁendishly clever story
that assails our sheltered traditions and

threatens to topple man from his vaunted
position as this planet’s preeminent thinker.
How so? Mohammed tells us what our sci-
entists are just now proving—whales have
brains more developed than those of
humans. Not just larger, mind you, but
more developed. Mohammed never spouts
falsely.

The whole world needs Mohammed
Wong Spouts! And fast. Are we so afraidvof
what we might learn that we kill whales at
sea? That spout on the horizon is a symbol
of compassion and wisdom—how long shall
we ignore it? The mind of Mohammed
Wong is a gift; the spout is a warning.

 

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Born in Maine, Robin Sanborn began writ-
ing for several greater Boston newspapers
at the age of sixteen. A journalism scholar—
ship took him to Rutgers University, and a
controversial play he wrote there took him
out. A student of logic at the University of
London, he traveled to Sri Lanka to study
Buddhism, “hitchhiked” back to Egypt, and
later enrolled in the University of Vienna
to write his Ph.D. dissertation on Nietzche.

While in Vienna, Mr. Sanborn smuggled
refugees from the Hungarian Revolution in

1956. After Vienna, he was the drama edi-
tor for the Stratford newspaper covering
Canada’s Shakespearean Festival.

Mr. Sanborn saw his first whale while
working as a cruise director in the South
Pacific, and the image, he says, kept re-
turning.

In addition to his freelance writing ser-
vice in Southern California, Sanborn is a
counselor in metaphysics and synchronistic
logic. He is the author of The Book of Stier,
published by Berkeley Press in 1971.
