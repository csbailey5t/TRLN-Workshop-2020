Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Thank you for the Minnesota material. These disclosures
all make my heart ache.

I hadn't heard from Miss Denise Smith by Nov. 29, so
I wrote to har on that date. No word yet. I am sadly needing
help. So many start out and give the impression that they are
anxious to do something and then fall by the wayside.

Please note item just published in our local paper.
These directions are accurate and if followed will give perfect
results. Ever since its appearance my telephone has been ringing
very often - complimmnts for one and in other cases only disclosing
the dreadful results of commercial food. I shall keep after these

commercial food distributors but I doubt very much that I shall
get anywhere with them. This food is a big money—maker for the
big stores. I have secured a number of COpies of the attached
Letter and will distribute them to local stores. Some salesmen
have told me they are compelled to push commercial food but

they are also putting in a word for additional food at every
Opportunity. Perhaps your daughter Cristobal would like to

see this. (If I have not Spelled her name correctly please
forgive me). I have sentéacopy to the AHA hOping they will die—
tribute it and.thus offset their very poor set of directions issued
this Spring. I shall also send it to All Pets magazine. If you
can use it in any way, please do.

Sincerely, “ r a ,

Who started the humane society?

There are humane societies in every
civilized land. Their story began in
England some 200 years ago. Humane
societies work to prevent and to punish
cruelty to helpless children and animals.

It was started by an English lawman
named Jeremy Bentham. He said that
laws should be passed to punish the cruel

”and stupid owners who beat and over-
worked their famn animals. He also said
that if young children learned kindness
to animals they would become better
adults. Many sensible people were
stirred by this talk. Many were shocked
when Lord Erskine listed some of these

cruelties in the House of Lords

In 1811, the English Parliament passed
the 111 Treatment of Cattle Bill. This was
mankind’s first law to protect animals
and cruel masters of farm animals were
punished by fines, or prison. It was called
the Martin Act in honor of Richard
Martin who worked for it in Parliament.
Many others wanted to help and two
years later they founded the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
Queen Victoria added her blessing and
it became a Royal Society.

More laws to protect pets and zoo
animals were passed in England. and
other countries passed laws of their own.
Other countries also started their SPCA

groups. In 1886, the first American
SPCA was started in New York. Its
founder was Henry Bergh. Many states
and cities soon had their SPCAs. The
laws to protect animals led to laws to
protect children and in 1874 Henry Bergh
founded the SPCC. Everywhere the SPCA
and the SPCC groups worked together;
for the fair treatment of both. children-
and animals. In Illinois, these united
groups became the world’s first Humane
Society. In 1877, this led to the founding
of the American Humane Society.

Inside North Shore

 

Bird- Lover D

By RALPH PEARSON

Back in March of 1939,
Traveler readers learned
of the unique “dial bird

house” designed by
Thomas Corrow, then of
Swampscott.

Equipped with a revolving
door with four different sized
-,- openings, the

nesting place

was con-

structed so as
a wide variety
of birds.

PEARSON .. That interest
in our young feathered friends
has never ceased on Corrow’s
part, having spent much of his
spare time in bird conservation
research.

Now a retired"‘SOUTH HA’M-.

I'LTO'N resident, the creative
North Shore man has come up
with a new way of mounting
birdhouses.

It all started a few years a 0
when Corrow became concerned
over newly hatched birds falling
out of tree houses, where birds
of prey devour them.

SADDLE BIRD
HOUSE DESIGNED

“So; I designed the saddle
bird housé—mounted on a limb
four-feet long, which is fastened
horizontally on a tree or post
eight-feet up from the ground,”
he related, explaining:

.“When baby birds arecalled
to take off, they walk out of the
house on the limb where they

SADDLE BIRD HOUSE invented by Thomos Corrow
of South Hamiltonenobles baby birds to learn to

are trained to fly and eat, they
find it the most natural thing to
do.”

The old-style . 'birdhouses‘ are
“out” ‘-as far as Corrow is
concernedr and the problem of
many of them is that they .are
not » mounted correctly, he
believes.

His proposed saddle birdhouse
will accommodate many species
of song birds, many of whom
have been destroyed by the
spraying of trees and shrubs
that grow the food they live on.

Birdhouses are best built of

three-quarter-inch pine or

..
cedar, acCording to Corrow. He
recommends an interior five
inches high, by \ﬁve-inche:
Wide, by five-inches long.

 

He suggest that an entry hole.
one and 'one-quart‘er
diameter be cut with the lower
edge about twp iﬁches from the
ﬂoor. A quarter-inch wide vent
should be bored about three-
quarters of an inch from the.f
roof at beth front and back as
well as. in the floor underneath
the entry hole.

lows and downy woodpeckers,
Corrow said.

It’s too late this summer to
be thinking about birdhouses
but ample time for the handy-
man who likes birds to plan on
making a saddle birdhouse for a

winter project.
‘REAL THING’
INSTALLED ON POST

The “real thing” has been
installed properly on a tall post
at Bradley Palmer State Park
in TOPSFIELD, through the
courtesy of Supt. Russell
Balch—if you have any con-
struction problems.

A member of the Massachu-
sett's‘a'n'd Lynn Audubon groups,
Corrow for man—37 years was" a
“bird bander” cooperating with

.\

the Federal Bureau of Biologi-
cal Research.

He banded birds by the
thousands and found hawks to
be “bad actors.”

In addition, the South
Hamilton man has spread his
knowledge on his favorite sub-
ject as a bird instructor for Boy

‘ and Girl Scouts for 20 years.

taxonomic studies did not produce
classiﬁcations that were clear improve-
ments over earlier ones, so that the
additional labor hardly seemed worth-
while. Protistology and especially bac-
teriology provide the principal excep-
tions to that statement, and it is sig-
niﬁcant that one of the present authors,
Sneath, is a bacteriologist. The attitude
of the authors is more appropriate to
his ﬁeld than to any other.

Perhaps the most serious problem
was that more and more different char-
acters and kinds of characters were
entering into progressive taxonomy. A
sufﬁciently satisfactory key or typologi-
cal classiﬁcation may be based on a
few characters, perhaps of only one
kind, but evolutionary taxonomy must
use all possible. It must evaluate their
nature and direction, and also of course
their degree. Multivariate coefﬁcients of
similarity clearly might help toward the
latter evaluation, but the computation
involved was discouraging to taxono-
mists, or quite beyond their capacities,
when the numbers of characters rose
into the dozens and higher. Attempts
to deal mechanically with quantity
were clearly less satisfactory than more
conventional simultaneous treatment of
quality and quantity. If only on those
grounds, advanced quantitative meth-
ods of this sort had little chance for
further deveIOpment before the 1950’s
when electronic computers began to be
generally available.

It must be admitted that all these
difﬁculties still exist. Some of them
are, however, alleviated by Sokal and
Sneath’s book. The heart of this book
is a highly useful discussion of mea-
surements of resemblance and associa-
tion potentially useful in taxonomy
and of methods for recognizing, de-
scribing, and arranging sets or clus-
ters.

In addition to basic concepts and
formulas, fairly detailed and simple in-
structions for actual calculation are
given. With a small number of charac-
ters, these can be carried out on desk
calculators and hence are valuable for
learning and comprehension. The ac-
tual research procedures recommended
are, however, almost completely im-
practical without large, powerful com-
puters.

Almost everyone will agree that the
concepts and methods so well discussed
by Sokal and Sneath are or can be-
come a most important adjunct to
taxonomy. They are already so rec—
ognized by many evolutionary taxono-
mists. Unfortunately, however, the au-

8 MAY 1964

thors have made themselves leaders of
a small group which, with the fervor
of conversion, holds that these nUmeri-
cal methods bearing on certain aspects
of classiﬁcation are not simply adjuncts
to taxonomy but, in themselves and
completely, are taxonomy. That view-
point and their fervor have led them
into many unintentional misrepresenta-
tions and exaggerations, to unjustiﬁed
antagonism toward much recent prog-
ress of the science, and to retrogres-
sion in taxonomic principles. (Ultra-
modern machine computation has curi—
ously led to a conscious revival of pre-

evolutionary, 18th—century principles.)

The present ferment in taxonomy
is a healthy sign. Eventually taxonomy
will surely proﬁt by the incorporation
of a “numerical taxonomy,” less rigid
and less fanatical. This book by Sokal
and Sneath will be a milestone in that
desired development, but in the mean-
time I fear that its biased attitude has
done not only some good but also
some harm to taxonomy and, indeed,
to its own basic thesis.

Communicative Systems of Animals: Acoustic Behavior

The study of animal communicative
systems has been a dominant theme in
the remarkable growth of interest in
animal behavior during the past dec-
ade. Sparked by von Frisch’s exciting
discoveries on bee dancing, and sup-
ported by the postwar development of
electronic instrumentation and other
special methods and apparatus, data
on animal communication have con-
tributed a thread of continuity that, in
some ways and at some times, has
seemed to be the principal axis of syn—
thesis in the entire ﬁeld of animal be-
havior. Of all the possible and proved
kinds of animal communicative sys-
tems, acoustical ones received the most
attention ﬁrst. There are probably two
reasons: (i) portable recording devices
and excellent sound-analyzing instru-
ments became available quite soon
after World War II and (ii) acoustical
signals seem to capture the imagina-
tion more quickly than other less
noticeable or less easily recorded and
translated kinds of informational trans-
fer. Review articles on acoustical com-
munication in the different vertebrate
and arthropod groups were appearing

as early as the mid-1950’s, and the ﬁrst,

book on the topic, in which modern
techniques were utilized, was L’Acous-
tique des Orthopteres, also edited by
R.-G. Busnel, which was published in
1955 as the outcome of an interna-
tional symposium held in April 1954.
In 1958, Hubert and Mabel Frings pub-
lished a bibliography containing 1752
references on sound production and
hearing in insects. Work on vertebrate
acoustical behavior was developing a
little more slowly, with certain investi-
gations especially prominent during the
early and middle 1950’s—spectrograph-

ic studies of bird songs by Borror and
Reese (Ohio) and by Thorpe and Mar-
ler (Cambridge), experimental work
on bat sounds and echolocation by
Grifﬁn (Harvard) and by Mohres
(T'Libingen), and investigations on am-
phibian acoustics by Blair (Texas).
The International Committee on Bio—
logical Acoustics, an organization of
workers on animal acoustics, was de-
veloped as the result of a meeting held
at University Park, Pennsylvania, in
1956; that meeting was sponsored by
the National Science Foundation and
organized and hosted by the Frings. In
1961 the Cornell Laboratory of Orni-
thology began publishing a small quar-
terly, The Bio-Acoustics Bulletin, under
the editorship of William R. Fish,
which in turn began an annual review
of bio-acoustical work, with contribu—
tions by various authors on inverte-
brates, amphibians and reptiles, birds,
underwater acoustics, techniques, and
methods. As Busnel notes in his pref-
ace to this book, several books and
symposium volumes on bio-acoustics
have been published during the past
seven years.

This volume, Acoustic Behaviour of
Animals (Elsevier, New York, 1963.
933 pp. Illus. $45), edited by R.—G.
Busnel, is a remarkable compilation,
and a tribute to the energy and perse-
verance of its editor, who was chieﬂy
responsible for the idea and for the
long, arduous task of seeing the book
through to publication. Some of the
“chapters” are exhaustively detailed—
for example, Bernard DuMortier’s
three-section treatment of arthropod
acoustics: (i) morphology of sound
emission apparatus, (ii) physical struc-
ture of acoustical signals, and (iii) etho- ,.

logical and physiological aspects of
acoustical behavior. Other chapters on
arthrOpods deal with ﬂight sounds of
insects (Sotavalta, Finland), acoustic
behavior of Hemiptera (Leston and
Pringle, Great Britain), anatomy and
physiology of sound receptors in in-
vertebrates (Autrum, Germany), sound
reception in Lepidoptera (Treat, U.S.),
and the role of the central nervous sys—
tem in orthopteran stridulation (Hu-
ber, Germany). The chapters on verte-
brates consider vocal communication
in monkeys (Zhinkin, Russia), echo-
location (Vincent, U.S.), audiogenic
seizures (Lehmann and Busnel,
France), comparative anatomy and
performance of the vocal organ in
vertebrates (Kelemen, U.S.), compara-
tive anatomy and physiology of the
auditory organ in vertebrates (Vallen-
cien, France), emission and reception
of sounds at the level of the central
nervous system in vertebrates (Chau-
card, France), and acoustic behavior
of ﬁshes (Moulton, U.S.), amphibia
(Blair, U.S.) , birds (Bremond,
France), and mammals (Tembrock,
Germany). The other chapters treat
methods in bioacoustic terminology
(Broughton, Great Britain), tech-
niques for study of signal structure
(Andrieu, France), underwater acous-
tics (Brandt, France), electroacoustic
techniques for the study of behavior
and certain aspects of animal acoustics
(Busnel, France), animal language and
information theory (Moles, France),
and inheritance and learning in the
devel0pment of animal vocalizations
(Marler, U.S.). There is an alphabeti-
cal index to scientiﬁc and common
names, a systematic index (which in-
cludes well over 1000 species names
and almost 1000 genera), and an 86—
page glossarial index (by Broughton)
that is sprinkled with essays on deﬁni-
tions and the history of usages.

With all the advantages and disad—
vantages inherent in a treatise by many
authors, this book can by no stretch
of the imagination be termed an im-
peccable work; its “chapters” vary al-
most as much in quality as they do in
style. One thing that is bound to con-
fuse readers is the inconsistent termi—
nology—a chirp is not always a chirp,
nor a pulse a pulse; and if»a syllable
or a ripple or a ﬁgure is carefully de-
ﬁned somewhere, that still doesn’t make
it easy to remember what is meant.
Terminology is a formidable problem
for those who work in animal acous-
tics, for they have to discuss a vast
array of signal patterns that often bear

714

, no resemblance to any sound familiar

to their readers.

The number of pages in the volume
could have been signiﬁcantly reduced
by eliminating the repetition between
articles and combining at least some
of the reference lists that overlap
broadly. The ﬁrst condition would have
been difﬁcult for Busnel and his co-
workers to accomplish, however, and
I doubt that many Americans (at least)
are going to complain about either
repetition or the frequently awkward
translations, in view of the fact that
Busnel went to the trouble of having
many of the 33 different contributions
(including six addenda) by 24 different
authors from six different countries
translated into English (more than half
of the articles were originally in some
other language).

As with all such publications, this
one is already sadly out-of—date, with
references in the body of the book
rarely dated later than 1960. Several
addenda, however, list or discuss work
published through 1962. The rate of
publication in this ﬁeld is evidenced by
the more than 100 papers that have
been published on arthropod acoustics
alone since DuMortier wrote his chap-
ters.

A major function of this volume
will be its role in pointing up not only
what is known in each area, but also
the paucity of data with respect to
questions that today are often consid-
ered long-settled. For example, eﬁicien-
cy in reproductive isolation among
sympatric species has been presumed to
be a principal function of acoustical
signals in several different kinds of ani—
mals, particularly insects, amphibians,
and birds; and, by extension, this has
been presumed to represent a principal
selective context in the shaping of sex
signals. The indirect evidence for this
contention is fairly good; thus, species
that are sexually active in the same
places at the same times have never

~been found to have identical sex sig-

nals, although closely related allopatric
and allochronic species sometimes do
(at least in insects). But for the third
and clinching sort of indirect evidence
—that overlapping species are more
different in this respect where they
overlap than where they do not—we
are still presented with but two cases:
W. F. Blair’s studies on frogs in the
genera" Acris and Microhyla. There is
scarcely more evidence of the direct

“Sort from experin‘fentation‘ ore-interspe-

ciﬁc signal discrimination—T. J. Walk-
er’s studies on tree crickets (1957);

Perdeck’s studies on grasshoppers
(1958); Alexander and Moore’s stud-
ies on periodical cicadas (1959); and-
Littlejohn and Michaud’s study on the
frog genus Pseudacris (1959). None
of these examples is satisfyingly con-
clusive, and only that of Walker, on
the simple pulse successions (trills) of
tree crickets, has clearly shown what
the signiﬁcant call differences are. Ad-
ditional studies on this tOpic, again
dealing primarily with amphibians and
insects, have been carried out since the
work cited in this volume, but there is
no reason to consider this question
closed; almost every positive result is
so qualiﬁed that we cannot reasonably
say that we fully understand how the
signals work.

Its comprehensive coverage allows
one to use this book to make some in-
teresting comparisons of different kinds
of acoustical systems in different kinds
of animals. For example, three kinds of
gross changes are encountered in com—
paring acoustical communicative sys-
tems from arthropods through lower
vertebrates to primitive mammals and
ﬁnally primates. There is a more or
less steady increase in the maximum
number of acoustical signals per spe-
cies or system; the different signals of
a species (with some obvious and sig-
niﬁcant exceptions) are more likely
to blend together than to be entirely
discrete or distinct from one another;
and the structure of the signals is more
strikingly inﬂuenced by events that
occur during development, in particu-
lar by stimuli of the same general na-
ture as the signals themselves (acous-
tical signals produced by conspeciﬁcs).
All of these are not unexpected com-
parisons, but, as in the data on
reproductive isolation, it is convert.“
ient to be able to back up one’s sup-
positions with a few facts.

My overall impression is that this
volume represents a tremendous col—
lection of facts, but not an adequate
synthesis, although the synthesis may
be as good as could have been devised
prior to the publication of this volume.
Certainly it is safe to say that at no
previous time has there been available
in one volume so much information
about any aspect of animal communi-
cation, perhaps about any particular
aspect of animal behavior. Each worker
in animal behavior will have to exam-
ine it and make his own decision about
the value of the contributions in his
areas, but it will be useful to all. The
fact that it is priced beyond the means
of most individuals is all the more un-

spring per mating pair, and if two
mutations per 2 X 10“ Offspring confer
a sufﬁciently large selective advantage
in the given environment so that their
carriers are the only survivors among
their sibs, then 10“ X 10'“ X 3 X 109 =
3 X 10"” possible different “progressive”
viable genotypes would have been pro-
duced “deterministically” and “oppor-
tunistically” out of a total of 3 X 1029
"tested by evolution.” _

This represents a tempo Of evolution
tar exceeding that which could have
occurred on earth or on any earthlike
olanet, yet only an inﬁnitesimal pro-

ortion of the lO<L23><108> possible geno-
pes with “different evolutionary po-
Intial” would have been sampled.

Clearly, unless a large proportion of
enotypes with “different evolutionary
otential” nonetheless should prove to

ye “similar evolutionary potential,”
nly organisms related by descent from
a common ancestor will have any ap-‘
.reciable chance of having “similar

olutionary potential.” Restated, only
observation of the evolutionary rec-

. strongly indicates that independent

rigin and “convergent evolution” have
occurred in connection with important
umanoid characteristics does it at pres-
make sense to give serious consid—
on to the occurrence of extrater-

, humanoids.

If a “humanoid” is an organism
which has a sophisticated data-process-
ing and information-retrieval system
and which. for adaptive purposes, can
communicate substantial amounts of the

8 MAY 1964

information used within its data-proc-
essing system to other organisms of the
same kind, then what is the evidence
for independent origin and convergent
evolution of important elements of
such systems?

I believe we can discount the sig-
niﬁcance of such primitive “reﬂex arcs”
among the higher plants as that of the
Venus’s-flytrap. The relationship of
nervous tissues and systems among ani-
mals is almost certainly the result of
parallel evolution based on descent
from a common. ancestor.

Sophisticated data processing has ap-
parently depended upon the evolution
of a complex visual apparatus, and it
is therefore particularly relevant to ask
whether the arthropod, molluscan, and
chordate eyes are examples of inde-
pendent origin, and whether the cepha-
lopod and vertebrate eyes are samples
Of convergent evolution.

Cytological evidence indicates that
visual receptors have a common cellu-
lar origin, representing the realization
of the evolutionary potential indicated
for the cilium among, for example, the
euglenoids. Were there no living ﬂagel-
lated species with eye-spots, and were
none of the electron-micrOSCOpic evi-
dence on the structure of photoreceptors
yet in, we might argue for independ-
ent origins Of primary photoreceptors.
Were there no living tupaioids (“tree
shrews”), the marked similarity (almost
identity) of the detailed sculpturing of
the external ear (too soft to leave a
fossil record) of some ceboids (New
World monkeys) to that of some Old
World monkeys and apes (and espe-
cially man), but dissimilarity to that
of living lemuroids, lorisoids, tarsioids,
and hapaloids (marmosets), might sug—
gest convergent evolution determined
by some obscure adaptive value special
to the higher primates. Tupaia glis with
its very human-like ears weakens that
argument and instead spotlights “evo-
lutionary conservatism” as well as
“opportunism.”

In the absence of knowledge con-
cerning the structure Of the “eyes” (if
any) of possible extinct ancestral
stocks of the arthropods, molluscs,-an-
nelids, echinoderms, and chordates,
embryological, anatomical, and neuro-
logical evidence strongly favors inde-
pendent origin and, in the case of the
cephalopods and vertebrates, converg-
ence. However, until a comprehensive
“molecular evolutionary” study of liv-
ing members of these groups has been
made, or “missing links,” living or fos-

 

sil, are discovered, one would not want
to hinge important arguments for sup-
port of Project Ozma or any substan-
tial part of NASA’s program on such
evidence.

Extensive communication among
members of a species seems to exist
only among some social hymenoptera
and some few vertebrates. Here the
case for independent origin of the
mechanisms in the two lines and of
convergence growing out of the “deter-
ministic potential” of the visual data-
processing equipment seems quite con-
vincing. Yet the scarcity of instances
of such communication. among the
many species with such potential em-
phasizes how largely uncertain is the
“determinism” of evolution. Since ours
appears to be the only sophisticated
communicating species on earth, it
seems reasonable to favor Simpson’s
view that “humanoids are, to say the
least, nonprevalent.”

The foregoing letters expand the dis-
cussion of extraterrestrial life in an
interesting way, subject as it is to the
different approaches of the discussants.
I want to enter only one demurrer.
Contrary to Halasz, there is neither
“vacillation” nor “Vitalism” in my
opinion about the origin of cells from
macromolecules. I hold this to be pos-
sible under physical laws but extremely
improbable. To maintain that it is a
“generalizable process” presumably
would mean that it would regularly
occur. that it is a necessary outcome
of physical law under. usual circum-
stances. That is, in my opinion, 'a
gross fallacy, sufﬁciently exposed by its
logically leading to the plainly false
statement that anything that has ever
occurred in history is “generalizable.”
A similar fallacy underlies belief that
principles like that of ecological in-
compatibility (or “competitive exclu-
sion”) might represent “a new level of
natural law.” Such principles differ
radically from natural laws not be-
cause they are biological rather than
physical, but because they are contin-
gent and historical rather than im-
manent. These matters are discussed at
some length in other chapters of This
View of Life, my book in which the
Science article is one chapter.

Boycott

There are two possible solutions to
the problem of “multivo-lumed re-
hashes” which was presented in the
letter .of David M. Greenberg (6 Mar.,
p. 992). When approached by the Hip-
pocrates Press to contribute to their
three-volume Problems in Omphalol-
ogy, the scientist can refuse outright if
he considers that the ﬁeld has already
been covered. If the work nevertheless
is published (£10 per volume, 9%
guineas if ordered in advance), he
should persuade the Library Committee
not to buy it.

South African Attitude

The following is a most interesting
paragraph from a 1962 publication of
the South African Council for Scien-
tiﬁc and Industrial Research entitled
Notes for South African scientists
visiting the U.S.A. and Canada:

It must be borne in mind that South
Africans are very much foreigners in the
United States, that great numbers of sci-
entiﬁc visitors pour into the U.S.—par-
ticularly from the newer countries of
Africa and Asia under technical assistance
programmes—and that American scien-
tists and institutions have virtually to pro-
tect themselves from visitors. They do
not take kindly to prolonged visits. In
general, interviews of an hour or two
with individuals and a day at a laboratory
are acceptable. Requests for casual visits
of two days or more to a single institu-
tion are likely to cause embarrassment to
the hosts. unless very special circum-
stances prevail, in which case the reasons
for the request should be stated in detail.
This, of course, does not apply to rela-
tively long visits to a single institution,
when in any case special arrangements
have to be made.

Information Programs about

Environmental Contamination

The alarm about air pollution sound-
ed by John R. Goldsmith at the AAAS
annual meeting (20 Mar., p. 1349)
was sounded also at the annual
meeting of the executive board

616

of Scientists’ Institute for Public Infor-
mation, at which time the board voted
that the Institute should develop—to
be added to its program on radiation—
public information programs on air

~ and water pollution and the effects of

large-scale use of pesticides and herbi-
cides. We are designing a comprehen-
sive project to train scientists in the
20-odd science-information committees
around the country to inform the pub-
lic by means of lectures and publica—
tions. Our plans include establishing in-
formation committees in communities
where none exist, organizing national
and regional conferences, symposia, and
workshops, and encouraging local re-
search. We look forward to publica-
tion of the report of the AAAS Air
Conservation Commission, with a View
to using it as a manual. We expect
also to use the excellent materials of
the Public Health Service. In addition,
we plan to issue our own reports, in-
cluding articles in the technical infor-
mation bulletin Nuclear Information
(soon to change its name), published
in St. Louis.

The action of the SIPI board reﬂects
a long-standing desire to initiate pro-
grams on all forms of environmental
contamination. The intense public con-
cern over fallout led the local infor-
mation committees to concentrate initi-
ally on this contaminant. As public in-
terest in radiation has waned with the
test-ban treaty, the committees have
been able to broaden the scope of
their activities. Preliminary programs on
air pollution have been initiated by the
Palo Alto, St. Louis, New York, and
Western Montana committees.

The board’s view of the relat'on be-
tween radiation and non-nuclea “Envir—
onmental contamination was explained
in a policy statement as follows:

We recognize that our past and continu-
ing concern with the hazards resulting
from radiation and nuclear war and our
present emphasis on general contamina—
tion of the environment reﬂect a deep-
seated problem regarding the social effects
of modern science and technology. These
issues exemplify a tendency for the grow-
ing power of science to be used in large—
scale technological applications without
adequate scientiﬁc knowledge of their
eventual effect on the capability of the
environment to support society.

Many of the beneﬁcial uses of science
are now limited by this defect. In direct-
ing attention to the hazards of technol-
ogy, we hope thereby to help reduce the
limitations on the social beneﬁts which
can be derived from modern science.
Thus, the conservation of the environment
is a matter of urgent attention for the
scientist and the public.

it
t

The three basic principles of the sci:
ence-information movement continue to
be that (i) information is presented
without political or.,mora1 judgments,
which judgments we consider the pre-
rogative and responsibility of all citi-
zens; (ii) information is prepared with
scientiﬁc objectivity, which includes at-
tention to divergent studies and inter-
pretations; and (iii) information is free-
ly available to all.

Japanese Names

The romanizing of Japanese names
presents certain difﬁculties which are
demonstrated in the article “Science in
Japan” by L. Campbell (21 Feb., p.
776). Thus, on the ﬁrst page the names
Ken-iti and Koichi appear. To be
consistent, these should be either Keni-
chi and Koichi (Hepburn system) or
Keniti and Koiti (Nihon or Kunrei sys-
tem). On page 779 we see Nishijima,
Nishimura, and Yamashita, on page
782 Higasi and Onisi. The syllable
-si should be -shi in every case (Hep-
burn), or else -shi should be -si. Two
ways are used to indicate pronuncia-
tion—Ken-iti on page 776 and Shin’-
ichiro on 779. In the same issue, the
name of the author of “Social life of
Japanese monkeys” (p. 783), D. Mi-
yadi, is romanized according to the
Nippon system; in the Kunrei system
it would be written Miyazi. in the
Hepburn system Miyaji. The last gives
the best phonetic rendition.

Perhaps the spellings follow each in-
dividual’s personal usage, a reﬂection
of the confusion engendered by the
availability of the three different sys-
tems alluded to. At present, grade
school children apparently are taught
modiﬁed Kunrei system; however. the
Hepburn system, a more natural on)
giving fairly faithful phonetic rend
tions of Japanese words, is used, f
example, for station names along the
Japanese National Railway lines.

Foreigners ﬁnd the Hepburn system
easiest to use. This was recognized I:

Gentlemen:

I have recieved your address in English class, as a
reference, as to were I can recieve information on how I can
help stop cruelty to animals. I am very concerned about the
matter of dognapping going on in the Maryland area. I think
there should be stricter laws so people who kidnap dogs for

labratory experiments do not get off so easy. I think that a

dog's life is as important as a human’s life, and should not

be disposed of easily.«
I am only in seventh grade, but I would like to
help stop this somehow.

Thank you.

Sincerely yours,

Gary Bo ser

noise levels. Quiet enjoyment should be built into

Government and Science

America’s most spectacular “growth” industry
in the last quarter-century has been scientific
research and development. It still is. Government
spending—for defense, space research, efforts to
conquer disease and a multitude of other pur-
poses—has been the chief force propelling this
growth. This fiscal year alone the Government
is spending almost $15,000,000,000 on research,
roughly three times what was spent in 1958.

In voting to have a nine-member panel investi-
gate the Government’s scientific activities, the
House of Representatives has given those who
will be charged with this task a historic oppor-
tunity. That opportunity can be used with maxi-
mum effectiveness only if “1:: right. questions
are asked and the right problems identified for
study. In such a vast complex of activities,
unquestionably headline-catching examples of
waste, duplication and perhaps even of just plain
silliness can be found. But such aberrations are
not the essence of what needs study.

The key questions in this area are more com-
plex: What should be the priorities, from the
VieWpoint of national interest, among the alter-
native areas of scientific research open at the
present time? Are funds being allocated to dif-
ferent projects on the basis of their real promise "I"
or on the basis of the sales abilities of a new ’
class of scientific entrepreneurs concerned pri-
marily with building up their own empires? Are
we paying enough attention to the social sciences
which may help us find solutions for the mam-
moth political and economic problems being
created by tempestuous technological change?
How is vast Governmental scientific spending
affecting the teaching programs and educational
quality of the many universities whose activities
have been radically transformed by their role in
conducting this research? Is the enormous em-
phasis upon scientific research for military and
space purposes damaging the civilian economy
and denying it needed research funds and man-
power? These and other fundamental questions
need study if we are to bring order into the
jungle where government and science now meet.

Research is the engine of progress in a period
of worldwide change; the Government as the
dominant investor in this field must be sure it
is putting its dollars where they will build the
brightest and most secure future for us all.

§TACEY COLE

 

 

KINDNESS is indeed a virtue. The doing of a

good deed is often reward enough of itself,

however it is especially appreciated when a

grateful “thank you” is offered in exchange.

Animals and birds can’t talk, or at least so we

. ’opine, but they can bestow
appreciation in other ways.

Late this fall a most in-

teresting nature adventure un-

folded in the town of Errol. I

am most grateful to Pearl

Barry of Colehrook for taking

the time to write me of one

man’s humanity to an animal.

Her account follows: It is

entitled, “éﬂg§§£§i‘yivBeaver.”ﬁ

.. "° “Merit Bean of théwAT M. i
ABean, Inc., lumber and pulp business, was
ruising one of his lumber tracts on the shore of

Akers Pond in Errol on Saturday, Nov. 6. His
pathway was intercepted by a large fallen tree
and on investigation he found the road block to be
the result of beaver operation. A large beaver
had incised the base of the tree until it had
toppled and in falling, a large branch had caught
the marauding beaver by one foot.

“This was an unusual accident as beavers are
generally very wise about the fall of a tree and
instinctively move away from danger. Neverthe-
less the animal had been caught by the weight of
the branch and endeavoring to free himself had
badly injured his paw.

“Mr. Bean, realizing he would need his tools,
drove to his home in Errol village and procured
an axe, tree jack, shovels, picks and chains. He
advised his mother, Mrs. Ether Bean to pick up
his son. Merit Jr., called “Buzzy,” 8 years old,
and daughter Juanita of 13 years, also his
nephews, Scott and Rand Bean, 13 years and 8

;years, and little niece,
‘bring them to Akers Pond.

 

Kimberly, 6 years, and

“Merit, in a reassuring and gentle tone, talked

,to the beaver while he was trying to cut away the

branches in order to lift the weight. The beaver
seemed to understand and rolled his eyes as
though in appreciation and offered no resistance
when the children carefully stroked his soft
luxurious fur back. The animal had to be hand-
lifted twice in order to place the releasing tools.

He was an unusually large rodent.

“After his foot was freed, he pulled himself,

dragging the injured limb, to the edge of the pond

and started swimming along the shore. Mr. Bean
sensed that the water was not deep enough for his
escape, as was proven, when he surfaced and tried
to break some anchor ice. Merit broke the
offending ice and immediately the animal swam
away to freedom in the deeper water.”

Our thanks to Pearl Barry for this most
interesting and well written account.

In our last column, in quoting from the
Audubon Quarterly on the subject of cardinals we
stated that probably “64 pairs” were sighted in
New Hampshire during the winter of 1964. This
statement should have read, “6 plus pairs.” It
may sometime be true that 64 pairs may be seen
in our state, I hope so, but for now I’m sure that
there are nowhere near this number. If any of
our readers happen to have a cardinal visit them
I would be most pleased to hear from you. My
mailing address is West Swanzey, N. H. 03469. By
the way, it is our policy never to use names of
our readers unless they specifically give us
permission to do so. When writing, if you wish
your name or the name of another used in
connection with your letters, please be sure to ask
the other person and mention in your letter that
the use of a name is permissable.

 




'Science Expert
On Dogs Are Cruel'

' THINK it is very cruel to
do experiments on dogs. I
think that peOple should keep
their dogs on leashes or in the
house so that people don’t go
around dognapping. I think
all people should be kind to
dogs, If men steal dogs I
think police should arrest
these peOple. I think people
shouldn’t be cruel to dogs.
They should like dogs be-
cause I think they are very
good friends to the people
here.
