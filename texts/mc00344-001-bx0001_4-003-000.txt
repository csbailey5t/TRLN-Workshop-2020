The Use of Alternatives in Drug Re-
search. Edited by A. N. Rowan, C. J.
Stratmann, University Park Press, Bal-
timore, 1980, 178 pp., ill., $24.50.

“There is no conflict between science
and humanity to animals. Humane sci-
ence is the best science. Humane science
is the best science as science.” So say
Russell and Burch in The Principles of
Humane Experimental Technique, first
published in 1959 under auspices of the
Universities Federation for Animal
Welfare, a British humane organiza-
tion. Throughout the book the zoolo—
gist authors present evidence to support
their claim that the longstanding, often
bitter controversy over the role of ani-
mals and of humane treatment of ani-
mals in biological research rests on mis—
understanding. They point out, for
example, that distress creates a dis-
torted situation and therefore distorted
data, and that ignoring the particular
needs of the animal model leads to
badly interpreted results. They recom-
mend study of the psychosomatics of
laboratory animals and propose crea-
tion of an integrative specialty devoted
to study of research design and humane
experimental technique.

The authors categorize their princi-
ples as replacement, reduction and re-
finement, the “3 Rs” of humane ex-
perimental technique. Replacement
means the substitution of non-animal
techniques for live animals. Reduction
uses fewer animals. Refinement, in
those situations where live animals are
still needed, means finding and using
elegant, humane methods.

Some examples of replacement are
the use of tissue culture in virology and
toxicology, and the use of microorga-
nism assays in nutritional research. Key
concepts in replacement are “discrimi-
nation” and “fidelity.” Discrimination
refers to the key properties in which the
researcher is interested, whereas fidelity
refers to overall inter-species similarity.
The “high fidelity fallacy” leads people
to prefer mammals as experimental

JULY/AUGUST 1981

 

models because they share more fea-
tures with the human, but these fea-
tures may not include the best discrim-
inating and correlating ones. The
authors admit that if we know practi-
cally nothing of the sub-system we are
studying (say, the effects of a com-
pletely new substance) it seems to make
sense to test the substance on an orga—
nism close to the human. But they ob—
ject that “completely new” is likely to
be an exaggeration and that we may

- overestimate the fidelity of mammals as

models for humans. In vitro human tis-
sue culture may after all, for some pur-
poses, be a model of higher fidelity to
the whole human organism than an in—
tact nonhuman mammal. The authors
suggest development of a general theory
of replacement, analogous to equiva-
lence in machines.

(An illustration of discrimination in
this section serves as a beautiful ex-
ample of the authors’ unifying think—
ing: The herring gull chick, presented
with a thin rod banded in a highly dis-
criminating fashion —- as determined in
other experiments —— reacts more to the
rod than it does to a model of a parent
gull’s head or even to the actual head
of a real parent gull.)

How will reduction be accomplished?
—— By improving research strategies and
reducing variance. Inbreeding will re-
duce variance. So will the study of lab-
oratory animal behavior, since it will
help determine sources of variance.

In illustrating refinement, the authors
attack what looks like the most difficult
problem: how to study pain and fear
under controlled conditions without
creating pain and fear in the animal.
They suggest a number of ways ——- for
example, training rats to lift their tails
away from a painful stimulus; studying
variations in the flight component of
courtship’ in the stickleback. Their
methods, where painful at all, are in-
comparably less so than many current
methods and are, besides, more inter-
esting.

The book concludes with a discussion
of the factors affecting progress toward
humane techniques. Delay in commu-
nication of information is seen as of
prime importance. Specialist isolation,
an important factor in such delay, can
be helped by methodologic study and
by broad education for researchers ——
for instance, comparative physiology
for pharmacologists. The impact of
regulatory agencies is very significant;

.045 Mini/4L

the authors recommend that agency rul-
ings be reviewed frequently to foster
rational testing; the high-fidelity fal—
lacy, they feel, may be more prevalent
at the legislative than at the laboratory
level.

The 3 Rs categories have been widely
accepted and are part of everyday use
wherever these issues are discussed, and
networks of information have been cre-
ated. However, psychosomatics of lab-
oratory animals have been studied only
to a very limited degree so far, with lit-
tle application to reduction or refine-
ment. Scientific specialization in devel-
opment of humane techniques has
hardly begun. This book remains ahead
of its time as the most lucid, unified,
and comprehensive approach yet of-
fered to the theory and practice of hu-
mane experimental technique.

The Use of Alternatives in Drug Re-
search, edited by Rowan and Strat-
mann, is a quite different kind of book.
It is a collection of talks by scientists
from different disciplines at a historic
first conference about alternatives in
1980. Dr. Rowan, the senior editor and
an Oxford-trained biochemist, was for-
merly scientific director of the Fund for
the Replacement of Animals in Medical
Experiments, the sponsoring organiza-
tion.

Several articles introduce the uses
and problems of tissue culture: Two,
for example focus on in vitro cell
models for studying mechanisms of
toxicity and resistance, and a third
summarizes the rapidly developing use
of short—term microbial assays for as-
sessing carcinogenic risk. A timely
“Alternative to the Draize Test” paper
presents the preliminary -— but favor-
able -—— results of shampoo testing using
an established line of mouse embryo
cells, and another paper presents an in
vitro battery for teratogen assay. A
study of the use of structureactivity
relationships in drug design is pre-
sented.

Though the discussions are of neces-
sity mostly preliminary, the volume is
an interesting introduction to the cur-
rent state of alternatives research. One
of the participants, Professor Nardone,
expresses particularly well what was the
primary affirmation of the conference:
“This is a unique moment in history
from the point of view of our oppor-
tunity to exploit in vitro systems. This
stems from a convergence of important
opportunities, some of which are re-
lated to basic cell biology research,
some to startling advances in tissue cul-
ture technology, and others to environ-
mental concerns.”

The effectiveness of the conference
report would have been enhanced by a
transcription of the discussion among
the participants; it is hoped that this
will be done in future volumes. The re-
striction to in vitro alternatives in drug
research disappoints by omitting refine-
ment possibilities such as the humane
psychiatric drug assays proposed by
Russell and Burch. Some of the presen-
tations are marred by excessive at-
tempts to predict what is and is not
possible with in vitro methods: These
presenters might have noted that, as
Rowan said in his introduction, “1n

Because many animal

view of the success of the carcinogen
screens it is interesting to note that as
recently as 1969 it was stated that ‘the
investigation of possible carcinogenic

. effect . . can only be studied in
animals.’ ”

Both of these books will be of inter-
est to any student of biology: Both pro—
vide much information, a sense of in-
tellectual adventure, and stimulating
exercises in methodology. The reader
who wants a general grasp of the field
of alternatives would do well to read

Research using laboratory animals
has been performed in this country
since the mid—18005. In contrast, re-
search on the laboratory animals them-
selves is of relatively recent origin.
None of the current journals concerned
primarily with the use of laboratory
animals as research substrates were in
print 30 years ago.

Recognizing the need for a com-
pilation of the voluminous literature
on the biology and diseases of labora-
tory animal species, the American Col-
lege of Laboratory Animal Medicine
(ACLAM) has sponsored a series of
texts to address this need. The Labora-
tory Rat, Volume 1, is the fourth in
the series. It has achieved the goal set
by the editors of being an authoritative
reference work. Each of the 15 chap-
ters in this volume attests to the au—
thors’ mastery of the subject matter.
The chapters are well referenced and
sufficiently illustrated. (Due to the
large amount of material to be in-
cluded, the Laboratory Rat was di-
vided into two volumes: Volume 1 de-
tails biology and diseases and Volume
2 will be devoted to research appli
cations.)

ANNUAL EEPOET 0F THE ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

730 FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK 19, N. Y.

This report covers the ﬁrst year of the Animal Welfare Institute, from [uly 10,
1951 to [une 30, 1952.

Upon its incorporation as a non-profit organization under the laws of
Delaware, the following oﬂicers and directors were elected: Christine Stevens,
President; Alfred R. Glancy Jr., Vice-President; Roger L. Stevens, Treasurer.
Estella Draper was appointed Executive Secretary by the directors. The follow-
ing persons agreed to serve as members of the Advisory Committee: Dr. Lee
R. Dice, Director, the Institute of Human Biology, University of Michigan;
Dr. Robert Gesell, Professor of Physiology, University of Michigan; Dr. Eric
H. Hansen, President, Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals; Dr. Peter Okkelberg, Emeritus Professor of Zoology and Emeritus
Associate Dean of the Graduate School, University of Michigan; David
Ricardo, Secretary, British Columbia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals.

In announcing its proposed program, the Institute cited three objectives:

1. Care: The establishment of a code for the handling and use of
laboratory animals.

The Institute will interest itself in all species of experimental animals.

2. Research: The encouragement of medical research of the highest
possible quality as opposed to mere quantity.

The development of techniques that will reduce to a minimum both the
pain suffered by animals and the number of animals required.

3. Procurement Programs: The survey of existing and proposed pro-
grams for the procurement of laboratory animals in an effort to discover the
best method of satisfying the needs of humanity in the advancement of
medicine, public health, agriculture, etc., without jeopardizing practical animal
welfare work or the general advancement of humanity through increasing
consideration for all living creatures.

Collection of Information

A major portion of the work of the Institute during its first year has
been the collection of reference material relating to these and other animal
welfare problems. A body of information of this kind has never before been
gathered in the United States; the task, therefore, is a large one necessitating
the correlation of facts in a wide variety of ﬁelds.

The basic problems involved are ethical ones. They demand a better
understanding between science and the humanities. Dr. Albert Schweitzer
represents, through his great accomplishments in medicine, practical Christian-
ity and ethics, the approach which the Institute believes necessary for the
achievement of its aims. It has sought Dr. Schweitzer’s guidance and received
much personal encouragement from him. His works, which stress the neces-
sity of extending a full sense of man’s ethical obligations to other forms of
life, provide a frame of reference for studies in the humanities.

Through consultation and correspondence with a large number of biolo-
gists and the collection of published material, the Institute has obtained a
fund of information including both fact and opinion which is essential for
the evaluation of potential cooperation between the biological sciences and
the humanities in the ﬁeld of animal welfare.

 




 

In addition to these basic studies, economics and the dissemination of Le
propaganda as they currently relate to animal welfare are being examined
by the Institute. These, together with legislation, are areas in which sharp
controversy exists and in which the Institute has made great efforts to dis-
tinguish accurately between fact and ﬁction. A listing of some of the speciﬁc
categories in which information is being collected follows:

Care and Housing of Laboratory Animals

1. Design and construction of buildings with reference to problems of
sanitation, ventilation, temperature, space, and general comfort and

efﬁciency. . . H t.

2. Design and manufacture of cages and other enclosures, feeding and
watering methods and devices.
3. Selection and training of animal room personnel.
4. Diets for experimental animals.
5. Bedding and resting places for experimental animals. Aid
6. Exercise for experimental animals.
7. Prevention of disease and parasites.
8. Anaesthesia, post-operative care and euthanasia.

Methods in Research, Teaching, Testing and Production of
Products which Involve the Use of Animals

1. Comparison of current practices in various institutions.

2. Methods and planning which could substitute for pain-inﬂiction.

3. Mass experimentation involving pain or distress. The ethical prob-
lems which it raises. Comparison with intensive observations on a
smaller number of animals.

4. Evaluation of the opinion of biologists on experimental methods
and needs.

5. Evaluation of the opinion of biologists and laymen on the amount
of suffering which it is justiﬁable to inﬂict in the course of scientiﬁc
investigation.

Funds for Animal Experimentation

1. Sources and amount of funds for research: Foundations, endowments,
annual drives, government.

2. Allocation and purposes for which funds are used and their effect on
experimental animals.

Procurement of .Diﬁerent Species of Laboratory Animals

1. General
a) Breeders and biological supply houses
b) Breeding in laboratories.

2. Dogs and cats
_a) Breeding
b) Purchase
c) Voluntary arrangements for use of impounded animals in pain-
less experimentation under humane supervision.
d) Compulsory requisition.
3. Wild species
a) Capture and importation.
b) Breeding.
4. Problems, costs, and comparisons.

Legislation and Codes

1. General animal protective legislation.

2. Legislation and voluntary codes in America and Europe relating to
the use and treatment of experimental animals.

3. Administration of such laws and codes.

4. The relationship of such written documents to actual practice in the
areas which they affect.

5. Legislation on the procurement of experimental dogs and cats, its
administration and effects.

H mnane Societies

l. Purposes, scope and history.
2. Activities and accomplishments.
3. Support of and opposition to effective animal protection.

M'zm’s Relationship to Other Forms of Life

1. Historical development of present day attitudes and practices.
2. World literature, philosophy and religion.
3. Its role in the advancement of civilization.

Information as outlined above has been collected through:

1. Consultation and correspondence with authorities in related ﬁelds.

2. The acquisition of books, pamphlets, and references, subscriptions
to scientiﬁc and animal welfare publications, and a nation-wide
newspaper clipping service.

3. Surveys.

4. Attendance at the following conventions and other gatherings:

Annual meeting of the New York State Humane Association, Buffalo,
September 17, 1951.

Annual convention of the Americal Humane Association, Cleveland,
October 1-4, 1951.

Annual meeting of the Michigan Federation of Humane Societies,
Ann Arbor, October 20, 1951.

Annual meeting of the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, St. Catherines, Ontario, October 25-26, 1951.

Animal Care Panel, Chicago, November 29-30, 1951.

Annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science, Philadelphia, December 27-30, 1951.

14, 1952.

UFAW conference, London, April 18-20, 1952. _ .

Annual convention of the American Veterinary Medical Assocratlon,
Atlantic City, june 25-26, 1952.

5. Visits to laboratories and breeding establishments.

Representatives of the Institute have made inspection visits to the labora-
tories of hospitals, universities and pharmaceutical houses in Six. states. An
Animal Welfare Institute representative also spent one month in England
Where laboratories were observed and discussions held with scientists, educa-
tors and animal welfare workers.

Detailed reports have been made on all of the laboratories visited,
describing accommodations and care for the animals, personnel, equipment

 




In visiting laboratories, an effort was made to ascertain the number,
species, and type of animals being used by each institution and its sources
of supply. The establishments of breeders who supply millions of animals
to laboratories were also visited.

Dissemination of Information

Publications, reports, and exhibits

The Institute’s ﬁrst publication was a booklet outlining its aims. Prepared
in consultation with a number of scientists and humane leaders, it was circu-
lated in mimeographed form to a larger group with a request for comments.
Finding that it received general scientiﬁc and humane approval, the Institute
then published it as a booklet, and a leaﬂet entitled "Typical Comments” was
prepared from the replies received to the trial mailing. The booklet was
then given a wider distribution, including all humane societies and all mem-
bers of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology with
a request for suggestions and expression of opinion. The replies received
were most interesting and varied; the majority expressed a favorable interest
in the program and aims of the Institute.

In order to make available current information relating to the welfare
of laboratory animals, the Institute began publication in December, 1951, of
a bi-monthly Information Report, four issues of which have now been pub-
lished. Thousands of copies of each issue have been distributed. They have
led to a very substantial correspondence with biologists, animal welfare
workers and other interested persons who have requested further information
from the Institute’s ﬁles and have contributed to its fund of available facts.
Both research laboratories and humane societies are represented on the
Institute’s membership rolls.

A comprehensive report was prepared for a pharmaceutical house which
requested the Institute’s advice on the construction of new animal quarters.
This report is available for use by other institutions.

A mimeographed article on the Institute was prepared for the press
conference held by the Institute in New York in December. An effort to
provide accurate information on animal experimentation for use by various
publications has been made through press releases and letters.

Booth exhibits emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations in
the use of animals and of proper accommodation and care for them were
displayed with the Institute’s literature at the annual meetings of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Humane
Association.

Throughout the year the Institute has sought to bring to the attention
of the public a straightforward approach to the problems involved in animal
experimentation. Numerous interviews have been given to writers. An Asso-
ciated Press feature story about the Institute was carried in approximately
forty Sunday newspapers in large cities throughout the country, and other
articles appeared in newspapers and popular magazines, as well as scientiﬁc
and humane publications. Reprints were made and distributed of articles
appearing in "Your Dog” magazine and “People Today”. Two articles highly
commending the Institute have been printed in Great Britain: in the Spring
1952 issue of “The UFAW Courier” and in the May 31, 1952 issue of “The
Lancet”, a leading British medical journal.

The International Whaling Commission

In 1944 and again in 1945, U.S., British and Norwegian officials
met to discuss means to control postwar whaling. Quotas were established
for immediate postwar seasons under the 1937 Agreement at about 2/3
Of the pre-war level. In November, 1946 a new whaling convention, the
International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, setting up
the International Whaling Commission (IWC) was concluded in Washington

D.C. Unfortunately, the 13 nations involved rejected a plan to impose

economic sanctions against whaling countries defying IWC quotas, leaving

the convention without means of enforcing compliance, and insisted on
an ”escape clause” whereby any member nation which did not like an
IWC decision adopted by a 3/4 vote of members need only file an
"objection“ to escape any obligation to comply.

By 1949, when IWC held its first meeting to set quotas for the
1949-50 season, the international fleet stood at 18 factory ships and
216 killer boats. ”By 1951 it had swelled to 20 factory ships,an§g
270 killer boats from 7 nationsx' Norway, Britian, Soviet Union, Japan,
South Africa, Netherlands and Panama, and Antarctic Blue whale stocks
were clearly crashing. Paralyzed by the "objection privilege" and
increasingly dominated by the whaling industry, IWC made no attempt
to significantly reduce the kill. The disastrous effect of continuing
high quotas was compounded by their being set not on a species by
Species basis (except for humpbacks) but in Blue Whale Units; a measure
of oil equivalent to 1 blue whale, 2 fins, 2 1/2 humpbacks, or 5 seis.
This invited the destruction of species in sequence, beginning with the
most valuable or most vulnerable, and allowed depleted Species to be.
Wiped out as an "incidental catch" by vessels hunting more abundant

Species. Further, IWC quotas, size limits and other regulations were

Gentlemen:

We have examined the balance sheet of the Animal Welfare Institute
as of June 30, 1979 and the related statement of functional support, revenue,
expenses, capital additions and change in fund balances,and changes in
financial position for the year then ended. Our examination was made in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and, accordingly included
such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances, except as stated in the following
paragraph.

Contributions received are not subject to audit beyond the recording
of revenues under the system of internal control as established by management.
Accordingly, it was impracticable to extend our examination beyond accounting
for recorded amounts.

In our opinion, except for the auditing of revenues prior to its
recording in the accounting records, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly the financial position Of the Animal Welfare Institute
as of June 30, 1979 and the results of its operations and change in fund
balances and its changes in financial position for the year then ended, in’
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis
consistentvﬁth that of the preceding year. .

Respectfully submitted,

Certified Public Accountants

Note A — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

1 - Operations - The Animal Welfare Institute is a non-profit corporation
organized for the purpose of providing education, information and
assistance for the welfare of animals on a country—wide basis. The
organization is solely funded by contributions from the general public
The organization received no federal or state grants for the adminis-
tration of programs.

Contributions are recorded as income when received, and securities
received are recorded at the market value as of the date of receipt.
Securities on hand at the year end are reported at such values. Con-
tributions received are considered to be available for unrestricted

purposes or as Specifically designated by donors for programs con-
ducted by the Institute.

The Institute follows the practice of capitalizing expenditures for
furniture and equipment in excess of $100; no donated equipment has
been received. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful
life of the assets.

Note B — Restricted Campaign Funds

In addition to the continuing programs and projects of the InStitute, a
special campaign of ’Save the Whales' has been conducted for the past five
years. Contributions for this purpose are received as the result of news-
paper advertisements, as well as from members and other contributors.

Such funds and the expenses relating directly to this campaign, including
newspaper appeals and promotion materials, are segregated in the financial
statements and the fund balance of this project at June 30, 1979 is stated
separately in the accompanying statements.

Note C ~ Donated Materials and Services

The Institute received no donated materials or equipment during the past
year. Although a substantial amount of executive time is received by the
Institute annually, no amount has been reflected in the accompanying state-
ments for such donated services, as no objective basis is available to
measure the'value of such executive services rendered to the Institute.

Note D - Income Taxes

The Animal Welfare Institute is exempt from Federal income taxes under
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and is also an exempt
organization for state franchise purposes. The Institute has also been
determined by the Internal Revenue Service as not to be a 'private
foundation' within the definition of Section 509(a) of the code.

animal o rth Control
The Agricultural appropriations bill was amended in Eg§h1978 and 1979
to include funds for research in animal birth control as a part of
animal health research. Chief proponent of the effort is the
Congress‘ only veterinarian, Senator John Melcher (D., Mont.),
who placed particular emphasis on birth control of feral dogs,
an important humane concern both from the standpoint of the dogs, many
of whom are starving, and from the standpoint of livestock they kill

or injure in an attempt to feed themselves and their pups.

Packwood-Magnuson Amendment for Whales

 

Several whaling nations, including the two largest, Tussia and
Japan)have heavy interests in fishing within the U.S. ZOO-mile zone.
an amendment to the Fishery Conservation and Management Act proposed
by Senators Bob Packwood (D.)Oregon) and Warren Magnuson (D.)Wash.)
would cut fish allocations by 50% on certification by the Secretary of
Commerce that a nation had violated the provisions of the Pelly
amendment. If the nation failed to rectify the violation, all
allocations would be terminated in a year. Because whaling is a
dying industry while fishing is extremely lucrative, this new
sanction is expected to ensure that regulations and quotas
adopted by the International Whaling Commission will be observed by
its member nations who will not wish to risk the loss of

opportunity to fish in the rich U.S. waters.

12,535 buttons and ?,98l "Save the Whale” tapes sent to adio stations.

 




CMPMGN To SAVE THE WHALES

~é>This year AVI was fortunate in being able to distribute recorded
messages to save the whales by four stars of stage, screen, and
television: Katharine Hepburn, Jack Lord, Gregory Peck,and Jason
Robarﬁs; all of whom generously donated the stirring calls they
made for publication. All are devoted to the causerg
'sThe tapes were sent to 3,981 radio stations, many ofnwhgm sent
back reports on their use of these public service announcements,

and the thousands of dollars worth of radio time they represented.

wﬁﬁWThree major trips on behalf of whales and dolphins were funded
by AMI during the course of the year. Lew Regenstein, Executive
Vice President of the Fund for Animals, flew to Japan for the
special meeting of the International Whaling Commission,
December 18-19, 1978, and wrote an article for Information Report
Volume 27, Number 4, describing the meeting at which a 41%
reduction in sperm whale ouotas was achieved, but a bad precedent

of secret Commissioners' meetings was set.

“W While the IWC was meeting in the Foreign Ministry, artist-activists
partially funded by AWI were making headlines in the Japanese press
by their creative and fascinating presentations. Martita Goshen,
ballerina and choreographer, danced her beautiful and moving,

"A Day in the Life of A Whale", on the pavement before a long
picket line of hostile Japanese union members who want to continue
whaling as usual. The dance was seen on television throughout

the country.

“ff:John Perry, the well known whale and dolphin sculptor, is the
creator of "Flo" the hot air balloon in the shape of a life-size
humpback whale, with a benign expression and disarming air which
charms all who see her‘Ekcept the Tokyo police who took-Pe ry
, , carﬂazl
into custody for several hours after he and his crew took her
down the Ginza. After her appearances in Tokyo, Flo went to

Kyoto, Nagggb, and Osaka, making news whereever she was flown.

’§:>In the spring, John Perry and his cohorts crossed the United States

with Flo whose picture appeared in papers throughout the country.

 




a I 5 O t .
National Television covered her flight past the Statue oi Liber y

:V;When Prime Minister Ohira paid a state visit to President
Carter, Flo was flying impressively from the Washington Monument
to the Jefferson Memorial, in full view of the two heads of

state during the welcoming ceremonies on the White House lawn.

Flo's appearance for the Japanese Prime Minister's Visit was
evidently reported to other heads of state as well, for when
Prime Minister Odvar Nordli of Norway planned a trip to Washington
a_few months later he sought to avoid public anti-whaling
confrontations. Norway is the third largest whaling nation in
the world. By honoring the request of the U.S. State Department
not to hold a demonstration in Washington, the AWI was given

the opportunity to arrange and take part in a meeting between
Norway's Foreign Minister Frydenlund and Senator Bob Pachwood.
This is the first time that the whaling issue has effectively
reached top Norwegian policy makers. A major result was the
formulation aijnizfuing of instructions to the IWC Commissionen§>

for Norway, -’e'Rindal, the strongly pro-Whaler former
Chairman of theIWC, who had been unencumbered since 1957 by

any official instructions. Appointment of a representative
to the Ministry for the Environment to the Norwegian delegation

was a second major forward step.*‘

MJust before the regular meeting of the IWC in London,
Flo toured France, the Netherlands,

and Britain making friends for whale
Generous donors made it possible for AWI to support these

imaginative ventures in diplomacy for whales.

conducted by Diane Halverson, AWI Research Assistant, on factory
farming with a particular focus on pigs. A documentary film
showing evidence of pathological mental states in gestating

sows confined to narrow cement-floored stalls in which the
animals cannot even turn around, was first shown at the 1978
World Congress for Animal Protection in West Berlin. The film
was taken by a veterinary researcher at the University of Munich,
Dy, Beatrix bewamg{ , and a copy was purchased by AWI after

it was ascertained that at least 60% of sows in Germany

are subjected to this cruel confinement. The systemyalthough
under continuing debate and discussion of its merits and demerits
in American academic journals on livestock husbandry2is widespread
here also. An analysis of the many papers she has studied and

summarized is being prepared by Halverson.

"TRAFHNG

Many of the cruelties AWI is fighting are modern cruelties-
new abuses that have greatly expanded in recent years because of
technological research and develOpment gone wrong. But trapping
with the steel jaw legmhold.trap is an old cruelty, a dreadful
anachronism in a period which, in virtually all other activities)
demands change and novelty.

._Js;fhe Woodstream Corporation<formerly known as the Animal Trap
CompanyDand the U.S. Department of the Interior's Animal Damage
Control (formerly known as Predator and Rodent Control) are the
two stronggholds of the leghold traps, from whose excruciating
grip many animals gnaw off their own feet to escape. Woodstream
is the largest trap manufacturer in the world, having bought up
its rivalquyAngis the biggest trapping entity in the world
having some77§3 \qﬂodstream manufactured leghold traps in the

field. Neither of these vested interests is interested in

I
a change in thejstatus oup. Even Interior's own internal knowledge

is not turned to any reduction of animal suffering. For example,
when the Department wants to trap an animal without injuring it,

it uses a leg snare known as the Aldrich snarejor it uses a tran-
ouilizer tab on an offset leghold trap so the animal falls asleep

and does not fight the trap. But thousands of predators and

of "non-target"animals are caught in leghold traps without benefit

of tranouilizers, and 15 years has passed since tranouilizers were
first written up.éﬂump)years have passed since the Department switched

 




from leghold traps to Aldrich snares for bears only.

”fsElsewhere, cable coated legsnares which enormously reduce

severe injuries as compared with the steel jaw leg/hold trap

are being developed, used, and indeed, according to the
manufactUrer of the Swedish leg snare, stolen by unscrupulous
admirers of its efficiency. In New Zealand, a comparable device
has been developed, and in Canada, the trappers' association has
expressed approval of a newly designed snare. Closer to home,an
employee of the New York State Department of Natural Resources,
Elmer Davies, has invented a snare whose name,"Ezyonem: expresses
the inventor's desire to cut down on the pain and suffering of

the steel jaw trap.

tﬁ’Demonstrating the difference is a paper by Jan Englund

which gives statistics on the injuries not only to legs, paws,
and toes, but to teeth, gums, and even jaw bones when the
frenzied foxes gnaw at the unyéﬁlding steel in a passionate
attempt to free themselves from the frightful grip of the

jaw trap. In a comparison test using the Swedish cable

coated leg snare, there were few serious injuries.

In his abstract Dr. Englund wrote: " Foxes caught in steel traps
(1651) and leg snares (l23) have been investigated on injuries
oghjaws and legs. The proportion of trapped foxes that had
worn down their teeth into jaw bone against the iron of the
steel traps is very high increasing from 19% among juveniles
up to 64% among foxes more than four years old." He concluded
"Steel traps are regardelggluel and should be forbidden every-

where. Foot-snares are a very good alternative."

Capture of freedom-loving wild animals cannot be termed humane
even under the best circumstances. But the monstrous cruelty of
the steel jaw trap is unnecessary for capture, and relatively
non-injurious alternatives such as box or cage traps and leg
snares should be immediately substituted. The AWI will continue
to encourage adoption of every possible means of ameliorating

the present intolerable situation.

BANNER YEAR FOR ANIMAL WELFARE LAWS
Six important actions were taken by the U.S. Congress this
year to improve protection of animals. They are summarized in

Wildlife Amendment_tg the Pelly Amendment

Terrestial as well as Marine animals are now included in the

Protective Act. All threatened or Endangered species were covered
in the new ”mendment which makes it possible for the President
to embargo all wildlife products from any nation that diminiébs
the effectiveness of an international wildlife conservation
agreement. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is a prime example.
Humane Slaughter Methods for Livestock

.Through an amendment to the Federal Meat Inspection
Act, all slaughterhouses subject to inspection under the Act
must now comply with humane standards for slaughter and handling
of cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules and other equines.
Proposed regulations to implement the new legislation were issued
June 29’ 1979 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food
Safety and Quality Service. Federal inspectors will be required
to stop any inhumane practices. Imported meat products are subject
to similar standards and may not be allowed into the country

if the animals were cruelly killed. Congressman George Brown

 




(D. Calif.) and Senator Fobert Dole (R. Kansas) were responsible for

passage of this important legislation. C

_§nimal_§irth_gontrol

 

The Agricultural Appropriations bill was amended in £8§h1978 and 1979

to include funds for researCh in animal birth control as a part of
animal health research. Chief proponent of the effort is the
Congress' only veterinarian, Senator John Melcher (D., Mont.),
who placed particular emphasis on birth control of feral dogs,
an important humane concern both from the standpoint of the dogs, many
of whom are starving, and from the standpoint of livestock they kill
or injure in an attempt to feed themselves and their pups.
Packwood-Magnuson Amendment for Whales

Several whaling nations, including the two largest, Russia and
Japanihave heavy interests in fishing within the U.S. ZOO-mile zone.
An amendment to the Fishery COnservation and Management Act proposed
by Senators Bob Packwood (D. Oregon) and Warren Magnuson (D. Wash.)
would cut fish allocations by 50% on certification by the Secretary of
Commerce that a nation had violated the provisions of the Pelly
Amendment. If the nation failed to rectify the violation, all
allocations would be terminated in a year. Because whaling is a
dying industry while fishing is extremely lucrative, this new
sanction is expected to ensure that regulations and quotas
adopted by the International Whaling Commission will be observed by
its member nations who will not wish to risk the loss of
opportunity to fish in the rich U.S. waters.

IncreaseFin Justice erartment Wildlife Law Enforcement

 

Four attorneys will soon be working full time to prosecute Violators
of laws protecting wildlife. Attached to the Divisionfof Lands and
Natural Resources of the U.B. Department of Justice, they will

devote efforts to ending the smuggling of exotic birds for the pet

trade, illegal importation of ivory and skins, andcther violations of

 




Lacey Act, Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection act,
- and other laws on wildlife. Increase in staff and funding is
the result of increased appropriations for the Division.
Whaling Moratorium Resolution; 9
Just before the regular meeting of the International Whaling
Commission (July 9-13, 1979) the U.S. Gongress completed
action on a Resolution calling for a moratorium on
commercial whaling. Senator Magnuson, author of the Resolution,
spoke eloquently on the floor of the Senate May 15, before its
unanimous passage. Congressman Don Bonker (D., Wash) chaired
hearings on similar resolutions in the House of Representatives,
and shepherded the legislation through to final passage. He
flew to London for the IWC meeting after the unanimous Congressional

vote, an important factor in INC action at the meeting.

LABORATORY ANIMALS

The policy of the :WI on use of animals for experimentation
and testing was expressed in a nine point statement developed
by the board-and advisory committee members. It was presented
at the World Congress for Animal Protection in West Berlin,
September 25-29, 1978 and published in full in Information Report
Vol. 27, No. 3, together with the Ecii text of the speech on
animal experiments in the? United States at the Congress by the
President of AMI. Examples of punishment, immobilization,

blinding, drumming, and forced fighting were given.

The abdract of the Animal Welfare Policy on the Use of

Vertebrate Animals for Experimentation and Testing states:

1' . . .
animals should be used for experimentation only 1) when there

r

is no known feasible alternative; 2) after review of a

carefullv desi;ned ex eriment based on knowledge of existing

 




literature on the subject; 3) using the(smallest possible number
of animals u) of the most suitable species, 5) maintained in an
optimum environment, 6) under the care of trained, sympathetic
personnel, and 7) preventing pain, fear, and anxiety by judicious
experimental design and generous use of anesthetic, analgesic

and tranQuilizing drugs. 8) Endangered species should not be

used; 9) Threatened species should only be used for experiments

. . . . . n
conforming With requirements for human experimentation.

The major government action on laboratory animals this
year was the revision of rules by the National Institutes of
Health entitled "Responsibility for the Care and Use of Animals"
effective January 1, 1979. Most significant is the provision
for stopping funding. NIH is the main funding agency for
research involVing animals inthe United States. The rules state
that grantees must follow twelve principles enunciated by FIH
including knowledge of the subject undenttudy sufficient to justify
the experiment and that it should beibonducted so as to avoid
all unnecessary suffering and injury to the animals."

NIH staff and initial review groups are asked to be "alert
for procedures or conditions in the application or proposal
that may violate the Principles " and to bring them to the
attention of the awarding unit staff and advisory councils by
a special note. The.results can be serious: "If deemed approp-
riate, the NIH may refuse to make to that institution further
awards involving the use of animals, suspend or terminate support
of specific projects involving the use of animals, suspend or

terminate support 0 projects by a specific investigator, or

 




suspend or terminate support of all projects involving animals
n n O O I ‘
at that institution.

How the new rules willcbe applied remains to be seen. inother

government action affecting test animals is the Good Laboratory
— regulations of the Food and Drug administration Wthh

went into effect Juneiuz 1979. instituted because of bad conditions
in testing laboratories the regulations and inspections are not
directed specifically at humane treatment of animals, but inoroved
standards may benefit the animals used.

qg’During the year, interest in development of alternative testing
methods grew substantially. Legislation was again proposed
(H;R¢2&Zlm'ﬁobert Drinan) to provide funds for the
development of methods which would not require the use of animals,
and hearings in the 95th Congress became hasanssx a real possi il ty.

This year AWI was fortunate in being able to distribute recorded
messages to save the whales by four stars of stage, screen, and
television, Katharine Hepburn, Jack Lord, Gregory Peck,and Jason
Robarbs; all of whom generously donated the stirring calls they
made for publication. 'All are devoted to the cause. .
The tapes were sent to 3,981 radio stations, many of whom sent
back reports on their use of these public service announcements,

and the thousands of dollars worth of radio time they represented.

Three major trips on behalf of whales and dolphins were funded
by AWI during the course of the year. Lew Regenstein, Executive
Vice President of the Fund for Animals, flew to Japan for the
special meeting of the International Whaling Commission,

December 18-19, 1978, and wrote an article for Information Report
Volume 27, Number A, describing the meeting at which a 41%
reduction in sperm whale ouotas was achieved, but a bad precedent

of secret Commissioners' meetings was set.

While the IWC was meeting in the Foreign Ministry, artist-activists
partially funded by AWI were making headlines in the Japanese press
by their creative and fascinating presentations. Martita Goshen,
ballerina and choreographer, danced her beautiful and moving,

"A Day in the Life_of A Whale", on the pavement before a long
picket line of hostile Japanese union members who want to continue
whaling as usual. The dance was seen on television throughout

the.country.

John Perry, the well known whale and dolphin sculptor, is the
creator of "Flo" the hot air balloon in the shape of a life-size
humpback whale, with a benign expression and disarming air which
charms all who see her-except the Tokyo police who took Perry
into custody for several hours after he and his crew took her
down the Ginza. After her appearances in Tokyo, Flo went to

Kyoto, Nagogo, and Osaka, making news wherebver she was flown.

In the spring, John Perry and his cohorts crossed the United States

with Flo whose picture appeared in papers throughout the country.

  




‘ I - 'b t.
National Television covered her flight past the Statue of L1 er y

Carter, Flo was flying impressivelnyrom the Washington Monument

to the Jefferson Memorial, in full view of the two heads of

Flo's appearance for the Japanese Prime Minister's visit was
evidently reported to other heads of state as well, for when
Prime Minister Odvar Nordli of Norway planned a trip to Washington
a_few months later he sought to avoid public anti-whaling
confrontations. Norway is the third largest whaling nation in
the world. By honoring the request of the U.S. State Department
not to hold a demonstration in washington, the AMI was given

the opportunity to arrange and take part in

Norway's Foreign Minister Frydenlund and Senator Bob Packwood.
This is the first time that the whaling issue has effectively
reached top Norwegian policy-makers. A major result was the
formulation and issuing of instructions to the IWC Commissioners

for Norway, Jorge Rindal, the strongly pro-whaler former
Chairman of the IWC, who had been unencumbered since 1957 by

any official instructions. Appointment of a representative
to the Ministry for the Environment to the Norwegian delegation

was a second major forward step.#‘

Just before the regular meeting of the IWC in London,

Flo toured France, the Netherlands, Denmark,

and Britian making friends for whales wherever she went.
Generous donors made it possible for AMI to support these

imaginative ventures in diplomacy for whales.

 




 

Pirate Whaling
This year's campaign to save the whales was characterized by

a sharp focus on the pirate vessels flying flags of convenience
and killing every whale they encounter-mothers and babies,

iblue whales, humpback whales, orcas- all with no regard whatever

for tharules set by the International Whaling Commission. Central

to the pirate whaling issue is Taiyo Fisheries, the biggest

fishing company in thekorld with untold international connections .

Taiyo vessels have been photographed receiving whale meat 3%
sea from the pirate whaler, "Sierra", and off-loading it in
Japan. Taiyo Employees physically detained a Japanese photo-
grapher who was seeking to photograph the arrival of the whale
meat. When he succeeded in outwitting the company by going

to a distant location and using a telephoto lens, the
photographs he obtained were not used by his paper, and the
editor hold him it was not in the national interest to take

such pictures.

Taiyo is a power in Japan and in some international business
circles. The only country in the world which offers a sub-
stantial market for whale meat. The prices obtainable are.
high for choice cuts. In this way, catching whales where

zero quotas have been set by IWC they can make fat profits.

The two new pirate whaling vessels that have joined the "Sierra"
are said to have been refurbished with funds derived from the
insurance received from a subsidiary of Lloyd's of London after
the "Tonna' another pirate whaler, was sunk last year by the
listing of the dead body of a great fin whale that had been
dragged on board.

South Africa hastily legislated against pirate whaling in the
spring of 1978‘under pressure of a +€lling series of articles "
by Stephen Wrottlesley of The Cape Times. Nevertheless,

the "Cape Fisher","Susan " and "Theresa" were all outfitted in
South Africa ports under the watchful eye of Andrew Behr, a
Norwegian who acts as agent for "Sierra Limited." He has two

daughters named Susan and Theresa. The Norwegian captain

of the "Sierra", T. Haraldsen, served as mate when the vessel

 




went by the name of the "Run". He is alleged to have stolen
the vessel from its rightful owner and captain, Knut Hansen,
following Captain Hansen's decision to abide by international

regulations on whaling- a decision which meant a substantial

reduction in profits.

A television documentary on pirate whaling was produced by
Thames Television and shown in the United Kingdom and Norway

in June 1979. A 28 page report entitled "Outlaw Whaling?
by Craig Van Note was published by the Center for Environmental

Education and an even more extensive report was compiled

by Nick Carter and published by the People's Trust for Endangered
Species in Britian. All this information demonstrating as it
does the extreme ruthlessness of the whaling industry, is bringing

world attention on the need to stop.

Dolphins

Frank Robson, author of "Thinking Dolphins, Talking Whales"

has a rapport with cetaceans and a profound understanding which
should be applied to end the repeated deliberate killings of
dolphins by the fishermen of Iki Island. AWI funded his trip -
to Japan from his native New Zealand where he joined Dexter Cate
of Earth Co-Existence Organization and Hardy Jones anif

who filmed the situation at Iki.

A huge influx of fishermen from other parts of Japan where
pollution has wiped out the fish, appears to be the cause

of the bcal fishermen's troubles. However, they rounded

up hundrede_of migrating dolphins and killed them, blaming

them for eating fish. But when Frank Robson and the American
friends of dolphins came to provide a means of directing dolphins
away from the fishing area, there was not a single dolphin to be
seen.

The dolphin saving team, eouipped with underwater electonic
sound devices, plans to return next year. At home, the

dramatic reduction in incidental killing of dolphins in tuna
»purse seines has levelled off. Alleged violations of the

Marine Mammal Protection Act by a number of tuna boats were

cited by the National Marine Fisheries Service. No final
court action has yet been taken. It is clear, however, that

to achieve compliance with Marine Mammal Protection Act's goal

 




5.

"approaching zero mortality and seines iniktb rate,"
it will be necessary to catch tuna without setting the

giant purse seines around dolphins.

Excellent results were reported this year on sets around

old logs or oil drums, both of which are known to attract large
schools of yellow fin tuna, the same species that swim with
herds of dolphins in the Pacific Ocean. This work should be
actively pursued and the results disseminated throughout the
fleet, by the National Marine Fishery Service, the

Tuna Research Foundation, and the Captains' Panel which

has had considerable success in improving performance and

reducing dolphin deaths.

Factory Farming

 

In a race to see how much of life's comforts and joys it

is possible to deprive animals of and still make money out

of them, factory farmers have been reducing the sizes of

cages and stalls to a degree that seems hardly credible to the

uninformed.

Veal calves, pigs and hens, are particularly victimized by
current industrial farming methods. There are no regulations
or laws in the United States to prevent the most extreme exploitive

methods. . ‘

In Britian, spurned on by the pioneering book, "Animal Machines"
by Ruth Harrison, 8 Royal commission was held and its report
known as the Branbell Report after the Chairman,

has resulted in a few neglect charges and in a focussing

of interest. Ruth Harrisongjformed the Farm Animal Trust

which is seeking scientific evidence on a comparison of methods
used in the rearing of young calves. The AWI made a grant

this year to the Trust to fund a study at the University

of Bristol on theieasibility of raising veal calves

in roomy pens with straw bedding, A Library search is being

 




27).

conducted by Diane Halverson, AWI Research Assistant, on factory

farming with a particular focus on pigs. A documentary film

showing evidence of pathological mental states in gestating

sows confined to narrow cement-floored stalls in which the

animals cannot even turn around, was first shown at the 1978

World Congress for Animal Protection in West Berlin. The film

was taken by a veterinary researcher at the University of Munich,
ﬂeakrrx fiwnnm2(‘, and a copy was purchased by AWI after

it was ascertained that at least 60% 0f sows in Germany

are subjected to this cruel confinement. The system although

under continuing debate and discussion of its merits and demerits

in American academic journals on livestock husbandry is widespread

here also. An analysis of the many papers she has studied and

summarized is being prepared by Halverson.

Tra in

Many of the cruelties AWI is fighting are modern cruelties-

new abuses that have greatly expanded in recent years because of
technological research and development gone wrong. But trapping
with the steel jaw leg hold trap is an old cruelty, a dreadful
anachronism in a period which, in virtually all other activities
demands change and novelty

The Woodstream Corporation(formerly known as the Animal Trap
Company>and the U.S. Department of the Interior's Animal Damage
Control (formerly known as Predator and Rodent Control) are the
two strong'holds of the leghold traps, from whose excruciating
grip many animals gnaw off their own feet to escape. Woodstream
is the largest trap manufacturer in the world, having bought up
its rivalszgoAEEDis the biggest trapping entity in the world
having someﬂéo woodstream manufactured leghold traps in the

field. Neither of these vested interests is interested in

a change in the Status qup. Even Interior's own internal knowledge

is not turned to any reduction of animal suffering. For example,
when the Department wants to trap an animal without injuring it,

it uses a leg snare known as the Aldrich snare or it uses a tran-
quilizer tab on an offset leghold trap so the animal falls asleep

and does not fight the trap. But thousands of predators and

of "non- target"animals are caught in leghold traps without benefit

of tranquilizers, and 15 years has passed since tranquilizers were
3 gassed since the Department switched

.

 




from leghold traps to Aldrich snares for bears only.

Elsewhere, cable coated legsnares which enormously reduce

severe injuries as compared with the steel jaw leg hold trap

are being deveIOped, used, and indeed, according to the
manufacturer of the Swedish leg snare, stolen by unscrupulous
admirers of its efficiency. In New Zealand, a comparable device'
has been developed, and in Canada, the trappers' association has
expressed approval of a newly designed snare. Closer to home,an
employee of the New York State Department of Natural Resources,
Elmer Davies, has invented a snare whose name "Ezyonem" expresses
the inventor's desire to cut down on the pain and suffering of

the steel jaw trap.

Demonstrating the difference is a paper by Jan Englund
which gives statistics on the injuries not only to legs, paws,
and toes, but to teeth, gums, and even jaw bones when the
frenzied foxes gnaw at the unyeilding steel in a passionate
attempt to free themselves from the frightful grip of the

jaw trap. In a comparison test using the Swedish cable

coated leg snare, there were few serious injuries.

In his abstract Dr. Englund wrote: " Foxes caught in steel traps
(1651) and leg snares (123) have been investigated on injuries
on jaws and legs. The proportion of trapped foxes that had
worn down their teeth into jaw bone against the iron of the
steel traps is very high increasing from 19% among juveniles
up to 64% among foxes more than four years old." He concluded
"Steel traps are regarded cruel and should be forbidden every-

where; Foot-snares are a very good alternative."

Capture of freedom-loving wild animals cannot be termed humane
even under the best circumstances. But the monstrous cruelty of
the steel jaw trap is unnecessary for capture, and relatively
non-injurious alternatives such as box or cage traps and leg
snares should be immediately substituted. The AWI will continue
to encourage adoption of every possible means of ameliorating

the present intolerable situation.

During the year, AIW has been active in bringing alternatives

to the attention of state and federal authorities and in encouraging

development and use of the least cruel substitutes for the jaw trap,

The quarterly Information Reports of the ANI were distributed
to approximately 30,000 individuals and organizations including
public librairies. Deans of medical and veterinary schools,
teachers, scientists, and other specialists who have requested
the information, and AWI members.

Eurhg the year the Federation of American Societies for
Experimental Biology decided to stop selling mailing labels
with the names of their members to other grOUps. AWI had

sent the Information Reports to FASEB members for years,

as the membership grew to some 15,000. At one period,

AWI was denied the right to purchase the labels and Adele
Scheopperle, AWI'S devoted Assistant Treasurer kept the

changes of address current- a huge task. With this second
refusal, it was decided to end the free mailing to FASEB
members, although we regret the lost opportunity to bring

to the main animal experimenters information that could reduce
animal suffering in laboratories.

Information Report articles whose subjects have not been mentioned
in the words of this report include:" Transport Improved for Pets and
Laboratory Animals," by Fay Brisk (V0. 27, No. b) in which

she wrote,"...hobby breeders pressured U.S.D.A. for nearly

a year to lower the minimum temperature regulations. They
insisted that their dogs, even show poodles with large areas

of closely shaved skin could survive in frigid weather, making
it clear that they were guided by an animal's capacity to

endure, rather than concern for its comfort."

ANII‘=L;L HELP AR E

JUNE 30, 1978 TO JULY 1, 1979

BANNER YEAR FOR ANIMA WELFARE LAWS

Six important actions were taken by the U.S. Congress this
year to improve protection of animals. They are summarized in
consecutive order. A

Wildlife Amendment to the Pelly Amendment

 

Terrestial as well as Marine animals are now included in the
embargo sanctions of the Pelly Amendment of the 1967 Fisherman's
Protective not. All threatened or Endangered species were covered
in the new amendment which makes it possible for the President
to embargo all wildlife products from any nation that diminiébs
the effectiveness of an international wildlife conservation
agreement. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered

Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is a prime example.

.L

Q

Humane Slaughter Methods for Livestock

‘Through an amendment to the Federal Meat Inspection
Act, all slaughterhouses subject to inspection under the Act
must now comply with humane standards for slaughter and handling
of cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules and other equines.
Proposed regulations to implement the new legislation were issued
June 29, 1979 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food
Safety and Quality Serviee. Federal inspectprs will be required
to stop any inhumane practices. Imported meat products are subject
to similar standards and may not be allowed into the country

if the animals were cruelly killed. Congressman George Brown

(

 




- (D. Calif.) and Senator Robert Dole (R. Kansas) were responsible for
passage of this important legislation. C
animal girth Control

The Agricultural Appropriations bill was amended in Eg§h1978 and 1979
to include funds for research in animal birth control as a part of
animal health research. Chief proponent of the effort is the
Congress' only veterinarian, Senator John Melcher (D., Mont.),
who placed particular emphasis on birth control of feral dogs,
an important humane concern both from the standpoint of the dogs, many
of whom are starving, and from the standpoint of livestock they kill
or injure in an attempt to feed themselves and their pups.
Packwood—Magnuson Amendment for Whales *

Several whaling nations, including the two largest, Russia and
Japanlhave heavy interests in fishing within the U.S. ZOO-mile zone.
An amendment to the Fishery Censervation and Management Act proposed
by Senators Bob Packwood (D. Oregon) and Warren Magnuson (D. Wash.)
would cut fish allocations by 50% on certification by the Secretary of
Commerce that a nation had violated the provisions of the Pelly

Amendment. If the nation failed to rectify the violation, all

allocations would be terminated in a year. Because whaling is a

dying industry_while fishing is extremely lucrative, this new

sanction is expected to ensure that regulations and quotas
adopted by the International Whaling Commission will be observed by
its member nations who will not wish to risk the loss of
opportunity to fish in the rich U.S. waters.
Increase'in Justice Department Wildlife Law Enforcement
Four attorneys will soon be working full time to prosecute Violators
of laws protecting wildlife. Attached to the Divisionfof Lands and
Natural Resources of the U.B. Department of Justice, they will

devote efforts to ending the smuggling of exotic birds for the pet

trade, illegal importation of ivory and skins, andcﬁher violations of

 




Lacey Act, Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection act,
- and other laws on wildlife. Increase in staff and funding is
the result of increased appropriations for the Division.
Whaling Moratorium Resolution' I
Just before the regular meeting of the International Whaling
Commission (July 9-13, 1979) the U.S. Gongress completed
action on a Resolution calling for a moratorium on
commercial whaling. Senator Magnuson, author of the Resolution,
spoke eloquently on the floor of the Senate May 15, before its
unanimous passage. Congressman Don Bonker (D., Wash) chaired
hearings on similar resolutions in the House of Representatives,
and shepherded the legislation through to final passage. He
flew to London for the IWC meeting after the unanimous Congressional

vote, an important factor in INC action at the meeting.

LABORATORY ANIMALS

The policy of the AMI on use of animals for experimentation
and testing was expressed in a nine point statement developed
by the board and advisory committee members. It was presented

at the World Congress for Animal Protection in West Berlin,

September 25-29, 1978 and published in full in Information Report

Vol. 27, No. 3: together with the 9551 text of the speech on
animal experiments in the? United States at the Congress by the
President of AMI. Examples of punishment, immobilization,
blinding, drumming, and forced fighting were given.

The abﬁract of the Animal Welfare Policy on the Use of
Vertebrate animals for Experimentation and Testing states:
“Animals should be used for experimentation only 1) when there
is no known feasible alternative; 2) after review of a

carefully designed ex-eriment based on knowledge of existing

 




literature on the subject; 3) using thecsmallest possible number
of animals n) of the most suitable species, 5) maintained in an
optimum environment, 6) under the care of trained, sympathetic
personnel, and 7) preventing pain, fear, and anxiety by judicious
experimental design and generous use of anesthetic, analgesic

and tranQuilizing drugs._ 8) Endangered species should not be

used; 9) Threatened species should only be used for experiments

. . . . . n
conforming with requirements for human experimentation.

The major government action on laboratory animals this
year was the revision of rules by the National Institutes of
Health entitled "Responsibility for the Care and Use of Animals"
effective January 1, 1979. Most significant is the provision
for stopping funding. NIH is the main funding agency for
research involVing animals inihe United States. The rules state
that grantees must follow twelve principles enunciated by FIB
including knowledge of the subject undenétudy sufficient to justify
the experiment and that it should beﬂconducted so as to avoid
all unnecessary suffering and injury to the animals."

NIH staff and initial review groups are asked to be "alert
for procedures or conditions in the application or proposal
that may violate the Principles " and to bring them to the
attention of the awarding unit staff and advisory councils by
a special note. The results can be serious: "If deemed approp—
riate, the HIH may refuse to make to that institution further
awards involving the use of animals, suspend or terminate support
of spec fi rojects involving the use of animals, suspend or

1.

This year AWI was fortunate in being able to distribute recorded
messages to save the whales by four stars of stage, screen, and
television, Katharine Hepburn, Jack Lord, Gregory Peck,and Jason
Robarbs; all of whom generously donated the stirring calls they

made for publication. ‘All are devoted to the cause.

The tapes were sent to 3,981 radio stations, many of whom sent

back reports on their use of these public service announcements,

and the thousands of dollars worth of radio time they represented.

Three major trips on behalf of whales and dolphins were funded

by AWI during the course of the year. Lew Regenstein, Executive
Vice President of the Fund for Animals, flew to Japan for the
special meeting of the International Whaling Commission,

December 18-19, 1978, and wrote an article for Information Report
Volume 27, Number 4, describing the meeting at which a 41%
reduction in sperm whale ouotas was achieved, but a bad precedent

of secret Commissioners' meetings was set.

While the IWC was meeting in the Foreign Ministry, artist-activists
partially funded by AWI were making headlines in the Japanese press
by their creative and fascinating presentations. Martita Goshen,
ballerina and choreographer, danced her beautiful and moving,

"A Day in the Life-of A Whale", on the pavement before a long
picket line of hostile Japanese union members who want to continue
whaling as usual. The dance was seen on television throughout

the.country.

John Perry, the well known whale and dolphin sculptor, is the
creator of "Flo" the hot air balloon in the shape of a life-size
humpback whale, with a benign expression and disarming air which
charms all who see her-except the Tokyo police who took Perry
into custody for several hours after he and his crew took her
down the Ginza. After her appearances in Tokyo, Flo went to

Kyoto, Nagogo, and Osaka, making news wherebver she was flown.

In the spring, John Perry and his cohOrts crossed the United States

with Flo whose picture appeared in papers throughout the country.

 




, . . t .
National Television covered her flight past the Statue of Liber y

Carter, Flo was flying impressively from the washington Monument
to the Jefferson Memorial, in full View of the two heads of
state during the welcoming ceremonies on the White House lawn.

Flo's appearance for the Japanese Prime Minister's Visit was
i for when

a few months later he sought to avoid public anti-whaling
confrontations. Norway is the third largest whaling nation in
the world. By honoring the request of the U.S. State Department
not to hold a demonstration in washington, the AMI was given

the opportunity to arrange and take part in a meeting between
Norway's Foreign Minister Frydenlund and Senator Bob Packwood.
This is the first time that the whaling issue has effectively
reached top Norwegian policy—makers. A major result was the
formulation and issuing of instructions to the IWC Commissioners

for Norway, Jorge Rindal, the strongly pro-whaler former
Chairman of the IWC, who had been unencumbered since 1957 by

any official instructions. Appointment of a representative

was a second major forward step.#‘

Just before the regular meeting of the IWC in London,
Flo toured France, the Netherlands,

AMI to support these

diplomacy for whales.

* (A report on the IWC meeting will appear in next year's annual

report because it took place shortly after the period covered in

this one.

 




 

Pirate Whaling
. L

This year's campaign to save the whales was characterized by

a sharp focus on the pirate vessels flying flags of convenience

and killing every whale they encounter-mothers and babies,

'blue whales, humpback whales, orCas- all with no regard whatever

for thdrules set by the International Whaling Commission. Central

to the pirate whaling issue is Taiyo Fisheries, the biggest

fishing company in thekorld with untold international connections .

Taiyo vessels have been photographed receiving whale meat 3%
sea from the pirate whaler, "Sierra", and off-loading it in
Japan. Taiyo employees physically detained a Japanese photo-
grapher who was seeking to photograph the arrival of the whale
meat. When he succeeded in outwitting the company by going

to a distant location and using a telephoto lens, the
photographs he obtained were not used by his paper, and the
editor hold him it was not in the national interest to take

such pictures.

Taiyo is a power in Japan and in some international business
circles. The only country in the world which offers a sub-
stantial market for whale meat. The prices obtainable are

high for choice cuts. In this way, catching whales where

zero quotas have been set by IWC they can make fat profits.

The two new pirate whaling vessels that have joined the "Sierra”
are said to have been refurbished with funds derived from the
insurance received from a subsidiary of Lloyd's of London after
the "Tonna' another pirate whaler, was sunk last year by the
listing of the dead body of a great fin whale that had been
dragged on board.

South Africa hastily legislated against pirate whaling in the
spring of 1978'under pressure of a +€lling series of articles ”'
by Stephen Wrottlesley of The Cape Times. Nevertheless,

the "Cape Fisher","Susan " and "Theresa" were all outfitted in

South Africa ports under the watchful eye of Andrew Behr, a

 

Norwegian who acts as agent for "Sierra Limited." He has two

daughters named Susan and Theresa. The Norwegian captain

of the "Sierra", T. Haraldsen, served as mate when the vessel

 




went by the name of the "Run". He is alleged to have stolen
the vessel from its rightful owner and captain, Knut Hansen,
following Captain Hansen's decision to abide by international

regulations on whaling- a decision which meant a substantial

reduction in profits.

A television documentary on pirate whaling was produced by
Thames Television and shown in the United Kingdom and Norway

in June 1979- A 28 page report entitled "Outlaw Whaling?
by Craig Van Note was published by the Center for Environmental

Education and an even more extensive report was compiled

by Nick Carter and published by the People's Trust for Endangered
Species in Britian. All this information demonstrating as it
does the extreme ruthlessness of the whaling industry, is bringing

world attention on the need to stop.

Dolphins

Frank Robson, author of "Thinking Dolphins, Talking Whales"

has a rapport with cetaceans and a profound understanding which
should be applied to end the repeated deliberate killings of
dolphins by the fishermen of Iki Island. AWI funded his trip -
to Japan from his native New Zealand where he joined Dexter Cate
of Earth Co-Existence Organization and Hardy Jones angi’

who filmed the situation at Iki.

A huge influx of fishermen from other parts of Japan where
pollution has wiped out the fish, appears to be the cause

of the bcal fishermen's troubles. However, they rounded

up hundreds_of migrating dolphins and killed them, blaming

them for eating fish. But when Frank Robson and the American
friends of dolphins came to provide a means of directing dolphins
away from the fishing area, there was not a single dolphin to be
seen.

The dolphin saving team, eouipped with underwater electonic
sound devices, plans to return next year. At home, the

dramatic reduction in incidental killing of dolphins in tuna
purse seines has levelled off. Alleged violations of the

Marine Mammal Protection Act by a number of tuna boats were
cited by the National Marine Fisheries Service. No final

court action has yet been taken. It is clear, however, that

to achieve compliance with Marine Mammal Protection Act's goal

 




a.

"approaching zero mortality and seines iniwrb rate,"

it will be necessary to catch tuna without setting the

giant purse seines around dolphins.

Excellent results were reported this year on sets around

old logs or oil drums, both of which are known to attract large
schools of yellow fin tuna, the same species that swim with
herds of dolphins in the Pacific Ocean. This work should be
actively pursued and the results disseminated throughout the
fleet, by the National Marine Fishery Service, the

Tuna Research Foundation, and the Captains' Panel which

has had considerable success in improving performance and

reducing dolphin deaths.

Factory Farming

 

In a race to see how much of life's comforts and joys it
is possible to.deprive animals of and still make money out
of them, factory farmers have been reducing the sizes of

cages and stalls to a degree that seems hardly credible to the

'uninformed..

Veal calves, pigs and hens, are particularly victimized by
current industrial farming methods. There are no regulations

or laws in the United States to prevent the most extreme exploitive

methods. . ‘

In Britian, spurned on by the pioneering book, "Animal Machines"
by Ruth Harrison, a Royal commission was held and its report
known as the Branbell Report after the Chairman,

has resulted in a few neglect charges and in a focussing

of interest. Ruth Harrisong/formed the Farm Animal Trust

which is seeking scientific evidence on a comparison of methods
used in the rearing of young calves. The AWI made a grant

this year to the Trust to fund a study at the University

of Bristol on theieasibility of raising veal calves

in roomy pens with straw bedding, A Library gearch is being

 




22/:

conducted by Diane Halverson, AWI Research Assistant, on factory

farming with a particular focus on pigs. A documentary film
showing evidence of pathological mental states in gestating

sows confined to narrow cement-floored stalls in which the
animals cannot even turn around, was first shown at the 1978
World Congress for Animal Protection in West Berlin. The film
was taken by a veterinary researcher at the University of Munich,
D,. Semkrlx EEWanzr‘, and a copy was purchased by AWI after

it was ascertained that at least 60% of sows in Germany

are subjected to this cruel confinement. The system although
under continuing debate and discussion of its merits and demerits
in American academic journals on livestock husbandry is widespread
here also. An analysis of the many papers she has studied and

summarized is being prepared by Halverson.

Tra in

Many of the cruelties AWI is fighting are modern cruelties-

new abuses that have greatly expanded in recent years because of
technological research and deve10pment gone wrong. But trapping
with the steel jaw leg hold trap is an old cruelty, a dreadful
anachronism in a period which, in virtually all other activities
demands change and novelty

The Woodstream Corporation(formerly known as the Animal Trap
CompanyDand the U.S. Department of the Interior's Animal Damage
Control (formerly known as Predator and Rodent Control) are the
twO‘strong'holds of the leghold traps, from whose excruciating
grip many animals gnaw off their own feet to escape. Woodstream
is the largest trap manufacturer in the world, having bought up
its rivalsgﬂxﬁgEDis the biggest trapping entity in the world
having somepée woodstream manufactured leghold traps in the
field. Neither of these vested interests is interested in

a change in the Status oup. Even Interior's own internal knowledge
is not turned to any reduction of animal suffering. For example,
when the Department wants to trap an animal without injuring it,
it uses a leg snare known as the Aldrich snare or it uses a tran-
quilizer tab on an offset leghold trap so the animal falls asleep
and does not fight the trap. But thousands of predators and

of "non-target"animals are caught in leghold traps without benefit

from leghold traps to Aldrich snares for bears only.

  

Elsewhere, cable coated legsnares which enormously reduce
severe injuries as compared with the steel jaw leg hold trap

are being developed, used, and indeed, according to the
manufacturer of the Swedish leg snare, stolen by unscrupulous
admirers of its efficiency. In New Zealand, a comparable device.
has been developed, and in Canada, the trappers' association has
expressed approval of a newly designed snare. Closer to home,an
employee of the New York State Department of Natural Resources,
Elmer Davies, has invented a snare whose name "Ezyonem" expresses

the inventor's desire to cut down on the pain and suffering of

the steel jaw trap.

Demonstrating the difference is a paper by Jan Englund

which gives statistics on the injuries not only to legs, paws,
and toes, but to teeth, gums, and even jaw bones when the
frenzied foxes gnaw at the unyeilding steel in a passionate
attempt to free themselves from the frightful grip of the

jaw trap. In a comparison test using the Swedish cable

coated leg snare, there were few serious injuries.

In his abstract Dr. Englund wrote: " Foxes caught in steel traps
(1651) and leg snares (123) have been investigated on injuries
on jaws and legs. The preportion of trapped foxes that had
worn down their teeth into jaw bone against the iron of the
steel traps is very high increasing from 19% among juveniles
up to 64% among foxes more than four years old." He concluded
"Steel traps are regarded cruel and should be forbidden every-

where; Foot-snares are a very good alternative."

Capture of freedom-loving wild animals cannot be termed humane
even under the best circumstances. But the monstrous cruelty of
the steel jaw trap is unnecessary for capture, and relatively
non-injurious alternatives such as box or cage traps and leg
snares should be immediately substituted. The AWI will continue
to encourage adoption of every possible means of ameliorating

the present intolerable situation.

During the year, AIW has been active in bringing alternatives

to the attention of state and federal authorities and in encouraging




development and use of the least cruel substitutes for the jaw trap.

AWI was denied the right to purchase the labels and Adele
Scheopperle, AWI'S devoted Assistant Treasurer kept the

TWENTY—EIGHTH ' IUAL REPORT
aNIKhL WELFARE INSTITUTE

JUNE 30, 1978 TO JULY 1, 1979

BANNER YEAR FOR ANIMAL WELFARE LAWS

Six important actions were taken by the U.S. Congress this
year to improve protection of animals. They are summarized in
consecutive order.

Wildlife Amendment_§g the Pelly émendment

 

Terrestial as well as Marine animals are now included in the
embargo sanctions of the Pelly Amendment of the 1967 Fisherman's
Protective Act. All threatened or Endangered species were covered
in the new amendment which makes it possible for the President
to embargo all wildlife products from any nation that diminises
the effectiveness of an international wildlife conservation
agreement. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is a prime example.

Humane Slaughter methods for Livestock

Through an amendment to the Federal Meat Inspection
act, all slaughterhouses subject to inspection under the Act
must now comply with humane standards for slaughter and handling
of cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules and other equines.

Proposed regulations to implement the new legislation were issued

June 29. 1979 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food

Safety and Quality Service. Federal inspectors will be required
to stop any inhumane practices. Imported meat products are subject
to similar standards and may not be allowed into the country

if the animals were cruelly killed. Congressman George Brown

 




(D. Calif.) and Senator Fobert Dole (T. Kansas) were responsible for
«passage of this important legislation.

_§nimal Birth Control

The Agricultural Appropriations bill was amended in Eg§h1978 and 1979

to include funds for research in animal birth control as a part of
animal health research. Chief proponent of the effort is the
Congress' only veterinarian, Senator John Melcher (D., Mont.),
who placed particular emphasis on birth control of feral dogs,
an important humane concern both from the standpoint of the dogs, many
of whom are starving, and from the standpoint of livestock they kill
or injure in an attempt to feed themselves and their pups.
Packwood-Magnuson Amendment for Whales

Several whaling nations, including the two largest, Russia and
Japan have heavy interests in fishing within the U.S. BOO-mile zone.
An amendment to the Fishery Conservation and Management Act proposed
by Senators Bob Packwood (D. Oregon) and Warren Magnuson (D. Wash.)
would cut fish allocations by 50% on certification by the Secretary of
Commerce that a nation had violated the provisions of the Pelly
Amendment. If the nation failed to rectify the violation, all
allocations would be terminated in a year. Because whaling is a
dying industry while fishing is extremely lucrative, this new
sanction is expected to ensure that regulations and quotas
adopted by the International Whaling Commission will be observed by
its member nations who will not wish to risk the loss of
opportunity to fish in the rich U.S. waters.
Increasefin Justice Department Wildlife Law Enforcement

Four attorneys will soon be working full time to prosecute Violators
of laws protecting wildlife. Attached to the Division of Lands and
Natural Resources of the U.S. Department of Justice, they will
devote efforts to ending the smuggling of exotic birds for the pet

trade, illegal importation of ivory and skins, andcﬁher violations of

 




 
 

Lacey Act, Endangered Species act, Marine Mammal Protection act,

 
    

and other laws on wildlife. Increase in staff and funding is

   

the result of increased appropriations for the Division.

  
     
 

Whaling Moratorium Resolution

 

Just before the regular meeting of the International Whaling

 
 

Commission (July 9-13, 1979) the U.S. Congress completed

  
   
  

action on a Resolution calling for a moratorium on

  

commercial whaling. Senator Magnuson, author of the Resolution,

   
 

spoke eloquently on the floor of the Senate May 15, before its

   
   
   
  
     
  
  
    
  
 
 
  
       
 

unanimous passage. Congressman Don Bonker (D., Wash) chaired
hearings on similar resolutions in the House of Representatives,

and shepherded the legislation through to final passage. He

flew to London for the IWC meeting after the unanimous Congressional

vote, an important factor in INC action at the meeting.

LABOPLTORY ANIMALS

The policy of the ﬁMI on use of animals for experimentation
and testing was expressed in a nine point statement developed
by the board and advisory committee members. It was presented
at the World Congress for animal Protection in West Berlin,
September 25—29, 1978 and published in full in Information Report
Vol. 27, No. 3, together with the full text of the speech on
animal experiments in the? United States at the Congress by the
President of AWI. Examples of punishment, immobilization,
blinding, drumming, and forced fighting were given.

The absract of the Animal Welfare Policy on the Use of
Vertebrate animals for Experimentation and Testing states:

animals should be used for experimentation only 1) when there

  
 

is no known feasible alternative; 2) after review of a

carefully designed experiment based on knowledge of existing

  




literature on the subject; 3) using the smallest possible number
of animals h) of the most suitable species, 5) maintained in an
optimum environment, 6) under the care of trained, sympathetic
personnel, and 7) preventing pain, fear, and anxiety by judicious
experimental design and generous use of anesthetic, analgesic
and tranquilizing drugs. 8) Endangered species should not be
used; 9) Threatened species should only be used for experiments
conforming with requirements for human experimentation.

The major government action on laboratory animals this
year was the revision of rules by the National Institutes of
Health entitled "Responsibility for the Care and Use of Animals”
effective January 1, 1979. Most significant is the provision
for stopping funding. NIH is the main funding agency for
research involVing animals inthe United States. The rules
that grantees must follow twelve principles enunciated by
including knowledge of the subject undenétudy sufficient to justify
the experiment and that it should be”conducted so as to avoid
all unnecessary suffering and injury to the animals.”

NIH staff and initial review groups are asked to be "alert
for procedures or conditions in the application or proposal
that may violate the Principles " and to bring them to the
attention of the awarding unit staff and advisory councils by

a special note. The results can be serious: "If deemed approp-

riate, the NIH may refuse to make to that institution further

awards involving the use of animals, suspend or terminate support
of specific projects involving the use of animals, suspend or

terminate support of projects by a specific investigator, or

 




suspend or terminate support of all projects involvind animals
t that institution.

How the new rules will be applied remains to be seen. inother
government action affecting test animals is the Good Laboratory

went into effect June , 1979. Instituted because of bad condit

During the year, interest in development of alternative testing
methods grew substantially. Legislation was again proposed

development of methods which would not require the use of animals,

and hearings in the 95th Congress became hazausax a real possibility.

ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

   

JUNE 30, 1978 TO JULY 1, 1979

BANNER YEAR FOR ANIMAL WELFARE LAWS
Six important actions were taken by the U.S. Congress this

year to improve protection of animals. They are summarized in

3

consecutive order.
Wildlife Amendment_tg the Pelly Amendment
Terrestial as well asMarine animals are now included in the

embargo sanctions of the Felly Amendment of the 1967 Fisherman's
Protective Act. All threatened or Endangered species were covered
in the new "mendment which makes it ,ossible for the President
to embargo all wildlife products from any nation that diminiébs
the effectiveness of an international wildlife conservation
agreement. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered

Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is a prime example.

L,

Q

Humane Slaughter Methods for Livestock

_Through an amendment to the Federal Meat Inspection
Act, all slaughterhouses subject to inapectibn under the Act
must now comply with humane standards for slaughter and handling
of cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules and other equines.
Proposed regulations to implement the new legislation were issued
June 29, 1979 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food

Safety and Quality Service. Federal inspectors will be required

   
 

 

   

 

    

to stOp any inhumane practices. Imported meat products are subject

to similar standards and may not be allowed into the country

if the animals were cruelly killed. Congressman George Brown




(D. Calif.) and Senator Robert Dole (2. Kansas) were responsible for

passage of this important legislation. C

animal Birth Control

 

The Agricultural Appropriations bill was amended in Eﬁ§h1978 and 1979
to include funds for researCh in animal birth control as a part of
animal health research. Chief proponent of the effort is the
Congress' only veterinarian, Senator John Melcher (D., Mont.),
who placed particular emphasis on birth control of feral dogs,
an important humane concern both from the standpoint of the dogs, many
of whom are starving, and from the standpoint of livestock they kill
or injure in an attempt to feed themselves and their pups.

Packwood-Magnuson Amendment for Whales

 

Several whaling nations, including the two largest, Russia and
apan’have heavy interests in fishing within the U.S. ZOO-mile zone.

An amendment to the Fishery COnservation and Management Act proposed
by Senators Bob Packwood (D. Oregon) and Warren Magnuson (D.'Wash.)
would cut fish allocations by 50% on certification by the Secretary of
Commerce that a nation had violated the provisions of the Pelly
Amendment. If the nation failed to rectify the violation, all
allocations would be terminated in a year. Because whaling is a
dying industry while fishing is extremely lucrative, this new
sanction is expected to ensure that regulations and quotas
adopted by the International Whaling Commission will be observed by
its member nations who will not wish to risk the loss of
opportunity to fish in the rich U.S. waters.
Increasefin Justice Department Wildlife Law Enforcement

Four attorneys will soon be working full time to prosecute Violators
of laws protecting wildlife. Attached to the Division of Lands and
Natural Resources of the U.3. Department of Justice, they will
devote efforts to ending the smuggling of exotic birds for the pet

trade, illegal importation of ivory and skins, andcmher violations of

 




  

Lacey Act, Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act,

   

- and other laws on wildlife. Increase in staff and funding is

     
 

the result of increased appropriations for the Division.

  

Whaling Moratorium Resolution-

 

   

Just before the regular meeting of the International Whaling

   

Commission (July 9-13, 1979) the U.S. Congress completed

  
 

action on a Resolution calling for a moratorium on

  
     

 

commercial whaling. Senator Magnuson, author of the Resolution,

 

    

spoke eloquently on the floor of the Senate May 15, before its

       
 

   

unanimous passage. Congressman Don Bonker (D., Wash) chaired

     
   

hearings on similar resolutions in the House of Representatives,

     
    
  

and shepherded the legislation through to final passage. He

flew to London for the IWC meeting after the unanimous Congressional

   

vote, an important factor in INC action at the meeting.

This year AWI was fortunate in being able to distribute recorded

   

messages to save the whales by four stars of stage, screen, and

 
 

television, Katharine Hepburn, Jack Lord, Gregory Peck,and Jason

 
 

Robarbs; all of whom generously donated the stirring calls they

    
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
    
   
 
    
  
 
  

made for publication. 'All are devoted to the cause. ,
The tapes were sent to 3,981 radio stations, many of whom sent,
back reports on their use of these public service announcements,

and the thousands of dollars worth of radio time they represented.

Three major trips on behalf of whales and dolphins were funded
by AWI during the course of the year. Lew Regenstein, Executive
Vice President of the Fund for Animals, flew to Japan for the
special meeting of the International Whaling Commission,

December 18-19, 1978, and wrote an article for Information Report
Volume 27, Number 4, describing the meeting at which a 41%
reduction in sperm whale ouotas was achieved, but a bad precedent

of secret Commissioners' meetings was set.

While the IWC was meeting in the Foreign Ministry, artist-activists
partially funded by AWI were making headlines in the Japanese press
by their creative and fascinating presentations. Martita Goshen,
ballerina and choreographer, danced her beautiful and moving,

"A Day in the Life~of A Whale", on the pavement before a long
picket line of hostile Japanese union members who want to continue
whaling as usual. The dance was seen on television throughout

the.country.

John Perry, the well known whale and dolphin sculptor, is the
creator of "Flo" the hot air balloon in the shape of a life-size
humpback whale, with a benign expression and disarming air which

charms all who see her-except the Tokyo police who took Perry

   

into custody for several hours after he and his crew took her

   

down the Ginza. After her appearances in Tokyo, Flo went to

    
 

Kyoto, Nagogo, and Osaka, making news whereever she was flown.

  
  

In the spring, John Perry and his cohorts crossed the United States

   

with Flo whose picture appeared in papers throughout the country.

O

_ Eirate Whaling

 

This year's campaign to save the whales was characterized by

a sharp focus on the pirate vessels flying flags of convenience
and killing every whale they encounter-mothers and babies,

blue whales, humpback whales, orcas- all with no regard whatever
for thdrules set by the International Whaling Commission. Central

to the pirate whaling issue is Taiyo Fisheries, the biggest

fishing company in theﬁorld with untold international connections .

Taiyo vessels have been photographed receiving whale meat aé
sea from the pirate whaler, "Sierra", and off-loading it in
Japan. Taiyo employees physically detained a Japanese photo-
grapher who was seeking to photograph the arrival of the whale
meat. When he succeeded in outwitting the company by going

to a distant location and using a telephoto lens, the
photographs he obtained were not used by his paper, and the
editor told him it was not in the national interest to take
such pictures.

Taiyo is a power in Japan and in some international business
circles. The only country in the world which offers a sub-
stantial market for whale meat. The prices obtainable are

high for choice cuts. In this way, catching whales where

zero quotas have been set by IWC they can make fat profits.

The two new pirate whaling vessels that have joined the "Sierra"
are said to have been refurbished with funds derived from the
insurance received from a subsidiary of Lloyd's of London after
the "Tonna' another pirate whaler, was sunk last year by the
listing of the dead body of a great fin whale that had been
dragged on board.

South Africa hastily legislated against pirate whaling in the
spring of 1978 under pressure of a +€lling series of articles ”’
by Stephen Wrottlesley of The Cape Times. Nevertheless,

 

" and "Theresa" were all outfitted in

the "Cape Fisher","Susan
South Africa ports under the watchful eye of Andrew Behr, a
Norwegian who acts as agent for "Sierra Limited." He has two

daughters named Susan and Theresa. The Norwegian captain

of the "Sierra", T. Haraldsen, served as mate when the vessel

 




 
 

went by the name of the "Run". He is alleged to have stolen

   

the vessel from its rightful owner and captain, Knut Hansen,

 
 
   
 
    
  
  
  
   
   
  
 
     
 

following Captain Hansen's decision to abide by international
regulations on whaling- a decision which meant a substantial

reduction in profits.

A television documentary on pirate whaling was produced by
Thames Television and shown in the United Kingdom and Norway

in June 1979- A 28 page report entitled "Outlaw Whaling?
by Craig Van Note was published by the Center for Environmental

Education and an even more extensive report was compiled

by Nick Carter and published by the People's Trust for Endangered
Species in Britian. All this information demonstrating as it
does the extreme ruthlessness of the whaling industry, is bringing

world attention on the need to stop.

Dolphins

Frank Robson, author of "Thinking Dolphins, Talking Whales"

has a rapport with cetaceans and a profound understanding which
should be applied to end the repeated deliberate killings of
dolphins by the fishermen of Iki Island. AWI funded his trip -

to Japan from his native New Zealand where he joined Dexter Cate

, ",1

of Earth Co-Existence Organization and Hardy Jones and/'
k

who filmed the situation at Iki.

A huge influx of fishermen from other parts of Japan where
pollution has wiped out the fish, appears to be the cause

of the bcal fishermen's troubles. However, they rounded

up hundreds-of migrating dolphins and killed them, blaming

them for eating fish. But when Frank Robson and the American
friends of dolphins came to provide a means of directing dolphins
away from the fishing area, there was not a single dolphin to be
seen.

The dolphin saving team, eouipped with underwater electonic
sound devices, plans to return next year. At home, the

dramatic reduction in incidental killing of dolphins in tuna
purse seines has levelled off. Alleged violations of the

Marine Mammal Protection Act by a number of tuna boats were
cited by the National Marine FiSheries Service. No final

court action has yet been taken. It is clear, however, that

to achieve compliance with Marine Mammal Protection Act's goal

 




"approaching zero mortality and seines iniwrb rate,"

it will be necessary to catch tuna without setting theL

giant purse seines around dolphins.

Excellent results were reported this year on sets around

old logs or oil drums, both of which are known to attract large
schools of yellow fin tuna, the same species that swim with
herds of dolphins in the Pacific Ocean. This work should be
actively pursued and the results disseminated throughout the
fleet, by the National Marine Fishery Service, the

Tuna Research Foundation, and the Captains' Panel which

has had considerable success in improving performance and

reducing dolphin deaths.

Factory Farming

 

In a race to see how much of life's comforts and joys it

is possible to deprive animals of and still make money out

of them, factory farmers have been reducing the sizes of

cages and stalls to a degree that seems hardly credible to the

uninformed.

Veal calves, pigs and hens, are particularly victimized by
current industrial farming methods. There are no regulations
or laws in the United States to prevent the most extreme exploitive

methods. . ‘

In Britian, spurned on by the pioneering book, "Animal Machines"
by Ruth Harrison, a Royal commission was held and its report
known as the Branbell Report after the Chairman,

has resulted in a few neglect charges and in a focussing

of interest. Ruth Harrisongyformed the Farm Animal Trust

which is seeking scientific evidence on a comparison of methods
used in the rearing of young calves. The AWI made a grant

this year to the Trust to fund a study at the University

of Bristol on thefeasibility of raising veal calves

in roomy pens with straw bedding, A Library search is being

conducted by Diane Halverson, AWI Research Assistant, on factory
farming with a particular focus on pigs. A documentary film
showing evidence of pathological mental states in gestating

sows confined to narrow cement-floored stalls in which the
animals cannot even turn around, was first shown at the 1978
World Congress for Animal Protection in West Berlin. The film
was taken by a veterinary researcher at the University of Munich,
D . ﬁeaérrx fivnnmgr‘, and a copy was purchased by AWI after

it was ascertained that at least 60% of sows in Germany

are subjected to this cruel confinement. The system although
under continuing debate and discussion of its merits and demerits
in American academic journals on livestock husbandry is widespread
here also. An analysis of the many papers she has studied and

summarized is being prepared by Halverson.
Tra in

Many of the cruelties AWI is fighting are mcdern cruelties-

new abuses that have greatly expanded in recent years because of
technological research and development gone wrong. But trapping
with the steel jaw leg hold trap is an old cruelty, a dreadful
anachronism in a period which, in virtually all other activities
demands change and novelty

The Woodstream Corporation(formerly known as the Animal Trap
Company>and the U.S. Department of the Interior's Animal Damage
Control (formerly known as Predator and Rodent Control) are the
two strong'holds of the leghold traps, from whose excruciating
grip many animals gnaw off their own feet to escape. Woodstream
is the largest trap manufacturer in the world, having bought up
its rivals.€oA£E>is the biggest trapping entity in the world
having some7ﬁb woodstream manufactured leghold traps in the
field. Neither of these vested interests is interested in

a change in the Status oup. Even Interior's own internal knowledge
is not turned to any reduction of animal suffering.. For example,
when the Department wants to trap an animal without injuring it,
it uses a leg snare known as the Aldrich snare or it uses a tran-
quilizer tab on an offset leghold trap so the animal falls asleep
and does not fight the trap. But thousands of predators and

‘Of "non-target"animals are caught in leghold traps without benefit

of tranquilizers, and 15 years has passed since tranquilizers were
first written u..zmumt> ears have passed since the Department SWitched




from leghold traps to Aldrich snares for bears only.

Elsewhere, cable coated legsnares which enormously reduce
severe injuries as compared with the steel jaw leg hold trap
are being developed, used, and indeed, according to the
manufacturer of the Swedish leg snare, stolen by unscrupulous

admirers of its efficiency. In New Zealand, a comparable device'

has been developed, and in Canada, the trappers' association has

expressed approval of a newly designed snare. Closer to home,an
employee of the New York State Department of Natural Resources,
Elmer Davies, has invented a snare whose name "Ezyonem" expresses
the inventor's desire to cut down on the pain and suffering of

the steel jaw trap.

Demonstrating the difference is a paper by Jan Englund

which gives statistics on the injuries not only to legs, paws,
and toes, but to teeth, gums, and even jaw bones when the
frenzied foxes gnaw at the unyeilding steel in a passionate
attempt to free themselves from the frightful grip of the

jaw trap. In a comparison test using the Swedish cable

coated leg snare, there were few serious injuries.

In his abstract Dr. Englund wrote: " Foxes caught in steel traps
(1651) and leg snares (123) have been investigated on injuries
on jaws and legs. The proportion of trapped foxes that had
worn down their teeth into jaw bone against the iron of the
steel traps is very high increasing from 19% among juveniles
up to 64% among foxes more than four years old." He concluded
"Steel traps are regarded cruel and should be forbidden every-

where{ Foot-snares are a very good alternative."

Capture of freedom-loving wild animals cannot be termed humane
even under the best circumstances. But the monstrous cruelty of
the steel jaw trap is unnecessary for capture, and relatively
non-injurious alternatives such as box or cage traps and leg
snares should be immediately substituted. The AWI will continue
to encourage adoption of every possible means of ameliorating

the present intolerable situation.

During the year, AIW has been active in bringing alternatives

to the attention of state and federal authorities and in encouraging

 




development and use of the least cruel substitutes for the jaw trap,

INFORMATIOV REPORTS

 

The quarterly Information Reports of the AWI were distributed
to approximately 30,000 individuals_and organizations including
public librairies. Deans of medical and veterinary schools,
teachers, scientists, and other specialists who have requested
the information, and AWI members.

IMrmg the year the Federation of American Societies for
Experimental Biology decided to stop selling mailing labels

with the names of their members to other groups. AWI had

sent the Information Reports to FAQEB members for years,

as the membership grew to some 15,000. At one period,

AWI was denied the right to purchase the labEIS and Adele
Scheopperle, AWI'S devoted Assistant Treasurer kept the
changes of address current- a huge task. With this second
refusal, it was decided to end the free mailing to FASFB
members, although we regret the lost opportunity to bring

to the main animal experimenters information that could reduce

animal Suffering in laboratories.

Information Report articles whose subjects have not been mentioned

in the words of this report include:" Transport Improved for Pets and
Laboratory Animals," by Fay Brisk (V0. 27, No. A) in which

she wrote,"...hobby breeders pressured U.S.D.A. for nearly

a year to lower the minimum temperature regulations. They

insisted that their dogs, even show poodles with large areas

of closely shaved skin could survive in frigid weather, making

it clear that they were guided by an animal's capacity to

endure, rather then concern for its comfort."

 




 
   

   

/0

. . U.S.D.A. decided in favor of the animals and did not lower the minimim

    

o
allowable temperature from hSOF to 35 as urged to do by shippers.

 
 
  
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

"New Zealand Marine Mammal Protection Act,” in the same
issue, told of the new law which carries a $10,000 fine

for taking any marine mammal without a permit.

Revocation of a dog dealer's license under the Animal

Welfare Act was reported in this ussue together with the

U.S. Animal Health Association Resolutions for Animal Welfare,
including :"We urge the U. .D.a. to expedite promulgation of
standards for exercise for laboratory dogs." A short

article by Professor R.S. Brodey, D.V.M.,M.S., described

how the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine is
reducing the number of animals used in teaching by using

videotapes in their place.

Smuggling of a million dollars worth of trapped furs into
Texas and the capture of the smugglers was d scribed in
Vol. 28, No. 1. Other titles in this issue include:

"Wisconsin Frog Dealer Crushes Pregnant Rana pipiens

 

Causing 13% Mortality” which cited a complaint by the
researcher receiving the cruelly mishandled frogs; "Humane
Protection of animals Office Established in FrenchGovernment",
”Cruelty to Small whales Decried by Worwegian Veterinarian";

and "Taiyo Loses $20 million in Japan JOiDt Whaling Company."

Vol. 28, NO. 2 reported "Bacterial Toxicity Test Six Times

Sensitive and 192 Times Faster than Conventional Vertebrate Test”;

  




and'Besearch awards Totalling $26,000 efferred for Successful
Substitutes for Laboratory Animals." John B. Oakes' excellent
article in The New York Times entitled "Trapped" was reprinted

in full. Quotations from President Carter's memorandum of

April 2M, 1979, on"Enforcement of International Endangered Species
Requirements" appeared in this issue together with an extensive
firstehand report on the Costa Rica meeting of the parties to

the Convention on Tnternational Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora. The whole of the excellent preface

by AWI Scientific Committee member, Samuel Peacock, Jr., M.D.,

to Jeff Diner‘s "Physical and Mental Suffering in Experimental
animals" was reprinted in this issue, as was Senator Manguson's
statement on the floor of the U.S. Senate on his resolution calling

for a moratorium on commercial whaling.

Dear Member:

A c0py of the Eighth Annual Report of the Animal Welfare
Institute is enclosed, As you will see, the year has been a
very active oneg Work for laboratory animals continues; further
progress is noted in the humane slaughter of food animals; the
bill to prevent cruelty to wild horses has been passed! by Congress;
increasing attention is being focussed on ending inhumane science
teaching in primary and secondary schools,

A reprint of an article on this subject by an experienced
school teacher, Miss Ella H, Pope, is enclosed. It gives a
concise picture of the cruelty and danger to children involved
in painful animal experiments in grade schools and high schools.
Your assistance in bringing this to the attention of responsible
teachers and principals would be appreciated, If you need extra
copies, we will be glad to provide theme (Extra c0pies of the
annual report are also available.)

With grateful thanks for your support during the past year,

I am
Sincerely,

Christine Stevens ,

SEEENII ANNUAL EEI’IIIIT
0E THE ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

350 Fifth Avenue, New York 1, New York

(July 1, 1952-June 30, 1953)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

During its second year, the Animal Welfare Institute has continued
to collect and disseminate information relative to the welfare of an—
imals, especially those used for experimental purposes. Representatives
of the Institute have visited the laboratories and animal quarters of
hospitals, foundations, universities and pharmaceutical companies. They
have met with scientists, administrators, and animal protective workers

in various parts of this country and England, have carried on an ex-
tensive correspondence and have participated in a number of conven-
tions and meetings. Bi-monthly Information Reports have been prepared
and eight to ten thousand copies of each issue distributed to biologists,
humane organizations and others.

In the past two years, the Institute’s reference ﬁles have grown
substantially and the information collected has proved useful to many
enquirers. Assistance has been given upon request to institutions plan-
ning to remodel old or construct new animal quarters, both in this
country and abroad. An example of these activities was a request from
a laboratory in Africa relative to the construction of animal quarters.
The Institute had recently acquired from the Lister Institute in Eng-
land a. well-drawn set of plans and descriptive material which seemed
especially well adapted to the needs described, and photostatic copies
were dispatched to Africa. Another example which may be cited was
a large metropolitan hospital in New York City, which was in the pro-
cess of planning new animal quarters at the time Institute representa-
tives visited its laboratory. At the request of the hospital authorities,
recommendations on planning including cages, built-in enclosures and
exercise facilities were presented for their use.

In addition to information concerning animals used in laboratories,
the Institute reported on the important new device developed by George

 




 

A. Hormel and Co. for the C02 anesthetization of hogs prior to slaugh-
ter. Lawrence Langer, Secretary of the National Inventors Council,
learned through the Institute of this work and referred it to the ap-
propriate subcommittee’ which in turn commended it for reference to
the Army, Navy and-Air Force.

This humane and useful invention exempliﬁes one of the ways in
which science and humanitarianism can successfully complement one
another. In this particular case, utilitarian considerations served as a
catalyst between the scientiﬁc research which made the invention pos-
sible and the humane purpose it serves in eliminating a vast amount
of fear and suffering previously inﬂicted on animals as a, matter of
course. It is also possible for science and animal welfare to make
direct mutual contributions. Technological advances must be made in
other ﬁelds of animal protection, a painless substitute for the steel
trap being the most urgent need of this kind. Humane contributions
to scientiﬁc work are especially needed in research using animals, for
the quality of the work in a large percentage of laboratories could be
improved by more careful attention to animal welfare. Discoveries of
new techniques to reduce the numbers of animals required in labora-
tories or to reduce the severity of the procedures to which they are
subjected are likewise much needed. Now that the Institute has been
declared oﬁicially tax exempt, it is hoped that substantial charitable
contributions may be forthcoming which will make it possible to ex-
tend the work of the Institute and to carry out such projects.

Summary Of Information Reports

The bi-monthly Information Reports issued by the Institute have
shown the necessity for improving conditions for experimental animals,
The Institute agrees with the American biologist who said: “That scien-

e]!

 




 

tists should not be hampered and animals completely protected: this is
one of those consumations devoutly to be hoped for.”

A growing awareness, on the part of some of the men engaged in
the practice of medicine and the related biological sciences, of the
need for greater efforts to prevent suffering to laboratory animals was
praised in the August-October Information Report. At the. same time,
the Institute pointed out that intensiﬁcation of such efforts is much
needed. An interesting suggestion for the humane control of animal
experimentation by scientiﬁc societies and journals was quoted from
the head of a medical research laboratory who is seriously concerned
with the problem of animal suffering in laboratories and believes that
scientists should take the necessary steps “to prevent disorder in our
own house.” This Report also carried an account of the action taken
by the Committee on Legislation of Queens County (New York) Med-
ical Society following passage of the Hatch-Metcalf Act: “May we of
the reference committee further suggest that it is the duty of the pro-
fession as a whole to assure proper enforcement of safeguards against
abuse of animals obtained through this law. This includes careful
supervision of experiments to see that they are conducted in a humane
manner, the setting up of regulations for the provision of proper
animal cages and care and the elimination of wasteful, purposeless’
and obviously fruitless experiments to which a larger supply of animals
may give rise.”

The intelligent attitude shown by the California Department of
Health Division of Laboratories which has charge of the administration
of the Animal Care Act of that State was cited as a hopeful sign
that this legislation will serve a useful and humane purpose. In a
letter addressed to all agencies using laboratory animals, the chief
of the Division of Laboratories emphasized the fact that using animals
for experimentation was a privilege and added, “The best way to en-
sure this privilege is to achieve a high standard of humane care and
management.”

Although funds for medical research in the United States today are
ten times greater than in 1941, the Institute called attention to the fact
that it is essential for directors of institutions planning new quarters
to insist upon adequate funds for decent and comfortable animal quar-
ters. Instances were cited of inadequate and undesirable quarters, lack
of exercise facilities and resting places, cages of insufﬁcient size for
the animal involved, and the statement was made: “Not only these
animals, but also every citizen who contributes directly or indirectly to
scientiﬁc research involving animals, have the right to a genuine guar-
antee that no unnecessary pain or distress is inﬂicted on them regardless
of whether or not such inﬂiction has become accepted as routine.”

 




 

The Institute has recommended to readers who are directly con-
cerned with laboratory animals two excellent standard works which
provide a fund of useful information: “The UFAW Handbook on the
Care and Management of Laboratory Animals” edited by A. N. Worden,
and “The Care and Breeding of Laboratory Animals” edited by E. J.
Farris. Also recommended as a reference source was a bibliography
made available by the Kettering Laboratory of the University of Cin-
cinnati. The Institute contributed a substantial list of references to the
recently revise-d issue of the bibliography.

The annual meeting of the Animal Care Panel, where disease con-
trol in laboratory animal colonies, the construction of animal quarters,
and breeding programs for various species were discussed, was reported
in the November-December issue of the report. Special attention was
given to humane recommendations. A recent statement by the National
Research Council was quoted at the meeting: “It is obviously just as
improper for a scientist to work with inadequately deﬁned animals
as it is for him to use impure drugs or badly calibrated measuring
instruments.” It was pointed out that the implications of this scienti-
ﬁc approach have very considerable humane signiﬁcance. Low standards
of animal care in. laboratories, the acquisition of heterogeneous animals
from a variety of sources, the use of sickly or undernourished animals,
failure to give veterinary treatment or to destroy sick animals, and
other similar practices which lead to unnecessary suffering also con—
tribute to; the use of the “inadequately deﬁned animals” which is con—
demned on purely scientiﬁc grounds.

During the course of the business meeting of the Animal Care
Panel a statement of the position of the Institute regarding the pro-
curement of experimental dogs and cats was asked for and given, the
agreements now in effect in Louisville, Kentucky and Vancouver, BC.
being cited (see Information Reports Vol. 1, No. 2; Vol. 1, No. 6; and
Vol. 2, No. 3). At the request of representatives of the National So—
ciety for Medical Research, a discussion was held following the meet-
ing concerning possible cooperation on this basis between research
institutions and animal protective organizations. Unfortunately, “all
or none” policies in respect to procurement of dogs and cats and the
provision of adequate safeguards for the welfare of laboratory animals
continue to command the support of both the NSMR and anti-vivi-
section societies, and in the May-June Information Report it was
necessary to correct statements made in the NSMR communications
sent to a number of humane societies. At the same time a protest against
the unauthorized use by an antivivisection society of statements made
by a member of the Institute’s Advisory Committee was brought to
the readers’ attention.

Emphasizing again the need for decent care and housing for lab—




 

oratory animals, the January-February report told of the Institute’s
exhibit at the 119th annual meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science in St. Louis. This exhibit called attention, with
pictures and captions, to the great progress made during the past
century in various ﬁelds: communications, science, medicine, child
welfare, transportation, industry, and asked: “Why so little progress
in laboratory animal welfare?” Six areas especially in need of attention
were listed. Together with the Institute’s recommendations, these are
reprinted on the back page of this report. The January—February report
also carried complete details on the new method of using anesthesia in
the slaughtering of hogs, and was illustrated with a design showing
the process.

Since Great Britain is the nation in which the most intensive study
has been given to the complex problems involved in animal experi—
mentation, the Institute sought ﬁrst-hand information on British prac-
tices as they affect both scientists and animals. Its reports have carried
comprehensive accounts on the manner in which British biologists have
dealt with the controversial and complex problems which arise in
connection with animal experimentation. These included the observa-
tions made by the Institute’s president on a visit to Great Britain and
a letter written by Major C. W. Hume, Director of the Universities
Federation for Animal Welfare which discussed animal experimentation
in Britain. A later Information Report carried an analysis by the Scien-
tiﬁc Sub-Committee of UFAW of the British legislation on laboratory
animals (The Cruelty to Animals Act) with suggestions useful to other
nations. The Laboratory Animals Bureau and the Animal Technicians
Association were described in one issue. These were formed in Great
Britain by scientists for the purpose of achieving more accurate results
through the use of better-bred, healthier, and better cared-for animals.
The Animal Technicians Association, made up of hundreds of the men
and women whose duty it is to care for experimental animals, has
done a great deal to raise the status of this important work and to
improve its quality. The Laboratory Animals Bureau publishes in-
formation concerning the care and procurement of animals for experi-
mental purposes. Excerpts from an excellent paper which appeared in
the Journal of the Animal Technicians Association on water require-
ments of laboratory animals were published in one of the Institute’s
reports. All of these organizations have been helpful in supplying in-
formation to the Institute, and a member of the Institute’s Advisory
Committee was appointed by the Universities Federation for Animal
Welfare to serve as Honorary Secretary for the United States.

Among all the issues relating to animal experimentation which have
been debated for nearly a century in the United States, the current battle
over the procurement of experimental dogs and cats has aroused the

 

 

 




 

most widespread controversy and bitterness. Legislation which would
force humane societies to provide animals for painful research has
opened up a whole new ﬁeld for strife and propaganda which did not
exist a few years ago. As a result, both the medical profession and the
animal protective cause have suffered from a variety of confused and
frequently erroneous impressions which have been created in the public
mind. Any solution to the relatively minor problem of procurement
of dogs and cats which reﬂects on the honor and integrity of medicine,
the biological sciences, and the humane movement, means a sacriﬁce
of the basic values of our civilization to a purely utilitarian expediency.
Echoes of this bitter controversy in the United States were heard in
Great Britain where two articles discussing problems relating to the
welfare of laboratory animals, procurement of dogs and cats, and the
position of the Animal Welfare Institute appeared in the May 31 and
August 23, 1952 issues of The Lancet, a leading British medical period-
ical. These articles were reprinted in full in the Institute’s November-
December Report. The Lancet articles pointed out that the Institute
is being attacked both by the anti-vivisectionists because it does not
condemn animal experiments, and by the research scientists because it
does not approve their policy towards animal welfare societies. Ex-
pressing surprise at this opposition to the middle course which the
Institute is following, the Lancet said: “Every country must work out
its own ethics in cases like this; and there is every reason to believe
that individual research workers in America impose on themselves a
code of humane regard for animals every bit as stringent as that ac-
cepted here. Regulations are designed not for well-doers, however, but
for the aberrant; and mankind being what it is, these are as likely
to be found among research scientists as any other group. Dispassionate
consideration of principles should convince our American research col-
leagues that if they are going to insist on freedom for themselves
from restrictions imposed from without they should, in common fair-
ness, insist equally on freedom from similar restrictions for the animal
welfare societies. For after all, the broad aim of these societies is iden-
tical with that of medicine—they are merely more catholic in their
choice of the animals they befriend. Moreover, if American scientists
cannot tolerate restrictions imposed from without, they can counter
anti-vivisectionist propaganda in another way—by drawing up their own
code of humane behaviour and requiring members of their scientiﬁc
bodies to conform to it.”

In its November-December Report, the Institute called attention to
the practical solutions which have been reached in Vancouver, B.C.
and Louisville, Kentucky, and which depend upon the important dis-
tinction between (1) chronic experiments, in which the animal is alive
and conscious for varying lengths of time, and (2) non-survival ex-
periments under full anesthesia in which the animal is ﬁrst rendered




unconscious, then used for any of a variety of scientiﬁc purposes,
and, at the conclusion of the experiment, killed without ever having
been permitted to recover consciousness. If properly conducted, the
second type of experiment is entirely painless; the ﬁrst type may cause
varying degrees of distress and pain.

Bills forcing the surrender of dogs and cats to laboratories make
no distinction between experiments and put no limit on the degree of
suffering that may be inflicted on the animals which they seek to force
the animal shelters to release. Obviously humane organizations are ethi-
cally bound to resist such legislation. They did this successfully during
the past year, and no new seizure laws have been passed.

Additional information on the agreement between Vancouver lab-
oratories, city pound, and the SPCA was published in the May-June
Report in which the Institute reiterated its belief that an atmosphere
of friendly cooperation and mutual trust is most urgently needed in
order to reach sound solutions to the problems involved in animal ex-
perimentation.

Recommendations Of The Animal Welfare Institute

 

PERSONNEL Many laboratories now employ untrained, underpaid men, classed
as unskilled workers, who have little interest in caring for animals. As a result, both
animals and research suffer.

AWI Recommends: Sound training of animal technicians, selected for com-
petence and a liking for animals; adequate budget appropriations. to insure fair salaries;
a title commensurate with their responsibilities.

* * *

HOUSING Overcrowding of animals is a major problem in modern laboratories.
For example, dogs and cats are often left for months or years with no provisions for
regular exercise, in cages only large enough to permit them to stand, lie and turn;
rabbits are frequently conﬁned to cages too small to allow them to stretch out in their
natural resting position.

AWI Recommends: Intelligent, thoughtful planning of housing, including a
practical study of the natural habits of the animals being used. The size of enclosure
should take into consideration the size of animal involved and the duration of con-

ﬁnement.
* =i= *

SANITATION AND DISEASE CONTROL Some laboratories, superﬁcially clean,
encourage the spread of disease by failing to sterilize equipment passed from one group
of animals to another and by not isolating sick animals. Other laboratories are actually
ﬁlthy. An attitude of “this is the best we can do” will not stop the spread of disease.

AWI Recommends: An efﬁcient cleaning and sterilizing program by personnel
who understand how communicable diseases spread; adequate heat, light and ventilation;
availability of veterinary advice for all animal colonies; an isolation period for newly
received animals, as well as isolation, treatment or destruction of sick animals.

* * *

MENTAL WELL-BEING Many laboratory animals suffer severely from fear,
loneliness and anxiety. Studies in psychosomatic medicine indicate the importance
of mental states.

AWI Recommends: Kind treament of all animals, adequate space and com-
panionship, and a special effort to keep contented the animals being held for long
periods of time.

* >l< >i<

PHYSICAL COMFORT Animals of all kinds frequently are deprived of a com-
fortable resting place, are maintained on metal grids, without bedding or resting boards,
and some are kept without water for long periods.

AWI Recommends: The provision of simple comforts for all experimental animals.

* >14 *

REDUCTION OF PAIN-INFLICTION Thoughtlessness in the planning of ex-
perimentation and teaching results in much unecessary suffering. For example, why
should nine consecutive experiments be performed by students in practice surgery on
a single dog?

AWI Recommends: Careful planning of all experimental and teaching prac-
tices with a view to eliminating unnecessary suffering and reducing the number of
animals used; use of non—survival experiments wherever possible; more extensive use
of anesthesia and pain-relieving drugs.

* =2: 3%
ALL LABORATORY ANIMALS ARE ENTITLED TO WATER,
FOOD, REST, EXERCISE, COMPANIONSHIP, SANITATION
AND KINDNESS.

January 6, 19?6

Mr. Robert Benson
Cechelot Design Group
38 Rowland Street
Marbleheed, Mass. 01945

Dear Mr. Benson,

The annual reports are beautiful! Thank you for the
beautiful drawings you made of the whalets tail and the
seal. He ie a fur seal! and thanks for arranging the whole
report so elegantly.

We are revising some of our publications and the one
now being readied for the printer is Humane Biologg_Projecte.
We went to change the cover and wonﬁer if you might Be
interested in making a suggestion. The idea, ae you can
see, is to offer alternatives to cruel experiments on ani~
male by high school students.

 

 

The printer is at work making corrections in the text
at the present time, and you may not be interested in this
particular area of animal welfare, but we admired your
excellent work with the annual report so much that I wanted,
at leaet, to let you know we'd love to have your work on
this, too.

Sincerely}

Chrietine Stevens
President
