Stop Inhumane Slau I

Are we completely civilized? There are still activi-
ties being carried on that are but a step away frOm bai- 1
‘bvarianism, that is the inhuman slaughter of animals for
meat purposes. We praise State Senator William Conk- ‘
lin, of New York City and Utica’s Assemblyman William
S. Calli, who are sponsoring a bill in the Legislature that
deserves passage without further delay. The bill must
at last be free of all defects that could be used with rea«
son in other sessions in opposition.

It would require that- animals be made insensitive: to
pain. before slaughter by mechanical, chemical, electri-
cal or other means that are “rapid and effective.” The
idea, of course, is to stop the horrors of slaughterhouses
that existed generally once upon a time and still persist
in some areas.

Congress in 1958 followed the example of enlighten-
ing nations generally in setting up a law barring cruel
slaughter methods. But this applies only in slaughtering
for the federal government and leaves loopholes else—
where unless states plug them. The law is designed not
to violate religious laws 011 ritual slaughtering.

The Conklin-Cali state bill'fiollows closely the federal
provisions that have been practiced without harm to
anyone; also, with economy to Wise meat packers, and
should get legislative backing this session. Surely New
York State is civilized enough to want to halt the cruel-
ties that commercial slaughtering sometimes permits. /l

Jewish Groups Spiiti on Slaughter 3171 I

The American Council for
Judaism believes there is
nothing in Senator William T.
Conklin’s “humane slaudhter’:
bill that V eWis re-
quirements for ritual slaugh-
ter.

’1‘ he Jewish Community
Council of Albany and other
Jewish community councils in
the state have taken the 0p-
posite point of View -—- that
the bill introduced by the
Brooklyn Republican would
violate the requirements of
ritual slaughter.

' A? delegation headed by
Rabbi Elmer Berger, execu-
tive‘president of the Ameri-

The Conklin bill, which has
been introduced annually for
the last several years, would
mandate human-e methods of
killing livestock. It does these
things:

a Requires that the an-
imal be “rendered insensible
to pain” by rapid and effec-
tive means, such as electric
shock, before it is slaugh-
tered.

I Humane Slaughter Bills Win

Moral Support of American
Council For Judaism

New York -——( Spl.)—-— The Ameri-
can Council for Judaism expressed
“moral” support for the aims of
humane slaughter bills recently in-
‘W New York State-
Legislature by Senator William T.
Conklin, (R., Brooklyn) and Assem-
blyman Luigi R. Marano (R.,
Brooklyn). -

This support was expressed in a
letter to New York Governor Nel-
son A. Rockefeller, _from Richard[
, L. Simon, New York Regional ‘Vice- t
President. I,

Mr. Simon told the Governor that i
the proposed bills “provided abso—
lute protection for shechita, the
ritual method of slaughter required
by some denominations in Juda-~
ism,” while seeking primarily to
eliminate grossly cruel methods of "
handling animals at meat-packing
plants prior to actual slaughter.

“There is nothing in the present
- bills . . . prejudicial to any observ-
' ance of the religion of Judaism.”

State is no? one gof them.

’The" State Legislature has before it
a measure introduced by Sen. William
Conklin of New York and Assemblyman
"William S. Calli of Utica to put this state
in line. ' ‘ _ ,

. The proposed law would require packing
plants to make animals insensible to pain
at .the‘ outset of slaughtering, This would
eliminate the barbarities and uncertain-
ties of present methods. The Conklin-
Calli prOposal has» the backing of humane
organizations throughout the state.

\ Sponsors of the legislation point out
that it would insure safer and better work-
ing conditions for workers, improve the
product and effect economy in’ slaughter-
, i-ng operations. But ‘aside from the ec0'~
nomic considerationsj the Empire State ' “On moral grounds we support the-
should ‘not be backward in enacting legis- ' aim of this legislation,” Simon
. lation which would end needless cruelty added’ - -
and suffering. " ‘

tern .

The 'Jewish Community
Councils and the American
Council for Judaism differ on
one key pointy-It is the com-
munity council position that
the bill is contradictory, be-
cause shackling and hoisting
have long been part of the
ritual slaughteringK process.

’Reds May Exploit
Algerian Crisis'

OUR newspapers are exhib-

iting a curious lack of
understandng about the A1-
gerian situation. On the front
page, March 19, we read of
the trace and chances for
peace. Elsewhere there was a
short article describing Al-
gerian relations with the
East and West. There it is
acknowledged that Algeria
will favor the Soviet-Sinc-
bloc. ' The significant factor
has been overlooked all
through the Algerian crisis.

Because Gen. De Gaulle
favored freedom for Algeria,
most people believed it to be
the right thing. ,For what
reasons De Gaulle has done
‘ this, we do not know. We do
know that the Communists
will soon control Algeria and
there will be a dagger point-
ed at the heart of two can-
tinents —- Africa and Europe.
,The controlof Algeria would
give the Communists access
to the vast oil deposits of the
Sahara. With this huge sup
ply of fuel, they may well
bring Europe to its knees.

ernment recognized the dan.

'Slaughrer Bills
Exempt Rifual'

GARSON H. Kaufiman,

president of Rochester
Hebrew Dietary Association,
said in a letter printed in the
Democrat and Chronicle on
March 19 that the humane
slaughter bills introduced
this year in the New York
Legislature “represent a de-
nial of one of the fundamental
rights of religious freedom
to the Jews of the State of
New York.”

I beg to differ with Mr.
Kauffman. Both the Calli Bill
in the Assembly and the Conk-
lin Bill in the Senate state in
regard to methods of animal.
slaughter, “humane method
means a method in acCordance
with. the ritual requirements
of the Jewish faith.”

Thus Jewish ritual slaugh-
ter is declared to be humane
and is exempt from the pro-
visions of both bills.

My Jewish friends tell me

that pre-slaughter handling
methods in Kosher killing are
not part of the Jewish .ritual
at all. In the present pre-
slaughter handling methods.
steers and cows are shackled
by a chain0 to one hind leg,
winch draws the chain up-
ward, the chain bites into the
leg and then hauls the ani-
mal into the air where it
dangles until its throat is cut.

***

IT IS THIS pre-slaughter
handling, no part at all of
the Jewish ritual, which the ,
proposed Humane Slaughter
legislation seeks to elimini-
nate.

I took to Albany letters
from several prominent Roch-
ester people of the Jewish
faith urging Majority Leaders
Senator Walter J. Mahoney
and Joseph F. Carlino to sup-
port the Humane Slaughter
Bills. Th ese Rochesterians
were very sure the Calli and
Conklin Bills in no way in-
fringed on religious freedom-

There is now a most humane
pre-handling device available
for Kosher slaughtering. This
device has been approved by
Jewish rabbis, the meat in-
spection division of the United
State Department of Agricul-
ture, many meat packers, and
humane societies.

This handling pen is very
satisfactory for steers; it does
not work on calves or sheep.
‘But the humane slaughtering
bill sponsored by the New
York State Humane Associa-
tion states expressly that the
provision of the bill will not
become operative for calves or
sheep until a satisfactory de-
vice has been developed to
restrain them for ritual
slaughter.

This statement was included
in (the bill so “that there could
not possibly be the slightest
infringement of full religious
liberty to any group in New
York State.

151......” Bills
Blow to Religion'

IN THE March 12 issue of

the D&IC, there appeared
an item in the Hometowner
column by Bill Beeney con-
cermng

a humane slaughter
'laW: befor ’ “

* Statute-Legislature, w h 1 c h
states that “it is a touchy sub-
ject because it becomes in-

volved with Orthodox Jewish '

ritual.”

We would like to inform
you that the Jewish way of
Slaughtering is erroneously
realled Orthodox. All segments
of the Jewish population who
observe the dietary laws,
abide by this method.

When the federal legisla-
tion on humane method of
slaughter 01f livestock was en-
acted i'n 1958, full safeguards
for the Jewish way of slaughu
ter were included in public
law 85-765, Section 6 of this
law, Which reads as follows:

“Nothing in this Act shall
be construed to prohibit,
abridge, or in any way hinder
the religious freedom of any
person, or group. Notwith-
standing any other provision
Of this act, in order to pro-
tect freedom/ of religion, rit-
ual slaughter and the handl-
a-mg’wor uother- preparatiM
livestock for ritual slaughten
are exempted from the terms
of this act.”

It is shocking to note that
in the State of New York, pro-
posals are being discussed in
the Legislature, which would
violate, in case of their adop-
tion, the religious freedom of
almost one~fifth of the popu-
lation of the state.

The Humane Slaughter
bills thus represent a denial
of one of the fundamental
rights of religious freedom to
the Jews of the State of New
York.

Measure in Senate
Forbids Shackling,
Hoisting of Cattle

New Jewish warnings were
Issued last week against the
Conklin Humane Slaughter bill,
now pendiWk
State Senate, which would pre-
vent Jewish ritual slaughter in the
State by forbidding shackling and
hoisting of meat animals prior to»

slaughter.

The Jewish Community Rela-

itlons Committee of Utica said

that the Conklin bill—and a com-;
panion Calli bill in the State As-‘
sembly—specifically exempt sche-
chi‘ta as a humane, method of
killing.

The committee added, how-‘
ever, that since there are not
now any means of pre-handling
available to New York abbat-
toirs, other than shackling and
hoisting, which would not in- ‘
terfere with schechita, the prac-
tical, effect of passage of the
measures would be to halt all»
kosher meat provisions within
the state. ~
A The same point was made by
the National Council of Young
Israel, which declared:

. “The Conklin bill was cleverly
‘worded in that, in theory, it does‘

not prevent Schechita. It dees,
however,
and hoisting of animals.

It has been reported, however, .
that a device 'dveve10ped by a Phil--

device cannot be used for smaller

ews-d’ay has .
mane slaughter bill will not be brought out of commit-

Jteeiibefore the Legislature adjourns.

.._ Only aimajor miracle will resurrect the bill, which

political" leaders have decided to shelve this year because
it is an election year and the bill is considered f‘too con—
'trofversial."~ ' ‘ v ‘ ’

It has been opposed by a number of orthodox rabbis

violates their ritual slaughter requirements and! IS a Viola-

_‘ tion of religious liberty. However, other Jewish religious
-4--"'leajders have gone on record stating that “there is nothing

in‘the bill prejudicial to any observance of— the religion of
Judaism .” , ~ _ .‘
The bill .is supported by the American Council for

Judaism. Rabbi Elmer Berger, executive president of ,
__that organizatipn," said that the re uirements of _. ritual

. a" I“.

learned that. the Conklin-lVIaran'o hug

 

- slaughter donot include prescribing the way an animal

is restrained. He said the iitual begins only at the time
the slaughter takes place... ; r

. Rabbi Berger-said there is nothing in Judaic lore—
including the -Talrnud amid the Torah—that prescribes
how an animal is tobeyihandled prior to the actual
slaughtering." As a matter of fact, he said, the only
reference to pre—ritual slaughter is an admo’nishment to
treat the animals kindly'before killing them.

(The Holy Torah’s funijdarnental law of Tsa’ar Ba’ale
Hayyim, as translated from“: the Hebrew, reads: “\Varning:
Domestic animals 'and'potiltry must be handled gently
and with mercy before their slaughter.- Care ”must be
taken not to cause pain; it'lis not permitted to punish the
animals. before they are slaughtered”)

The Conklin—Marano bill would outlaw the present

pie-killing methods usedf’iby some packers of hoisting

and sliackling animals. Itxvvould require that the animals
be restrained humanely instead ,

. (There is now a. humane restraining pen for use in
Kosher beef’PSlauhtergthat ha ber- J H 0 101V

with ritual requirements by the Joint Advisory Com—
mittee of the Synagogue Council of America. ,

But the restraining pen, developed by Cross Brothers
Meat Packers.of Philadelphia, so far can be- applied only
to larger animals. Lambs and calves are too small, to be
held by the pen and until the device is furtherdeveloped
to care for the smaller animals, the New York and New
Jersey slaughter houses will not approve it.

Present inhumane hoisting and shackling methods
have been Opposed by some orthodox rabbis who have
been visiting here from Israel. They so reported to au—
thorities in Israel, which has since refused shipments of
meat from New York slaughter hOuses' on the grounds
that it had been prepared for ritual slaughteriby prior ‘

‘hoisting and shackling' and, therefore,"was condemned

as non-kosher meat.

If a satisfactory restraining pen to accommodate all
sizes of animals is deve10ped within the next few months,
it is- possible that the next session of, the Legislature will
bring about the end of the inhumane treatment of
slau_hter animals.

Legislature by Senator Conklin
and Assemblyman Calli, in a
statement released from its head-
quarters, 5 Beekman St., New
York City. -

The 'Orthdox movement called
upon all Jews to make a special
effort to defeat this legislation,
which it scored as “one of the
most seriOus dangers to its reli~
gious liberty ever faced by the
largest Jewish community in the
werlcl.” ‘

The organization sent a mem-
orandum to all members of the
New York State Senate and As»
sembly, urging the rejection of the lre'place d by the use or the hu-
Conklin-Calli bills, since their {mane- pen for hOlding' cattle for
passage would virtually make it ' i
irnpossible for Jews to observe the
practice of Svhechita.

The Agudath Israel memoran-
dum calls upon the New York
legislators not to be misled by the
fact that the Conklin-Cam bills
recognize Shechita as ‘fhumane.”
The fact that the bills prohibit
the customary practice of prepar-
ing the animal for Shechita,
“makes of this recognition of the ,
humanen-ess of .Schechitah a ,
mockery,” the statement declares,
since in effect it would outlaw
the entire practice of one of the
basic. tenets of the Jewish faith.

making it impossible for those

such as this which, unfounded
though they are, have succeeded
in defeating year after year this

_ Y 'Slaughfer Bills
Exempt Rifual'

GARSON H. Kauffman,
president of Rochester
Hebrew Dietary Association,
said in a letter printed in the
Democrat and Chronicle on
March 19 that the humane
' slaughter bills introduced
‘ New York
Legislature “represent a de-
nial of one of the fundamental
rights of religious freedom
to the Jews of the State of 37
New Yor .”

I beg to differ with Mr.
Kauffman. Both the Calli Bill
in the Assembly and the Conk-
lin Bill in the Senate state in
regard to methods of animal
islaughter, “humane method
imeans a methnd in accordance
with the ritual requirements
of the Jewish faith.” 7

Thus Jewish ritual slaugh-
ter is declared to be humane
and is exempt from the pro-
visions of both bills.

My Jewish friends tell me

. x "’

that pre-slaughter handling
methods in Kosher killing are
not part of the Jewish ritual
at all. In the present pre-
slaughter handling .methods,
steers and cows afé "S‘hackled
by a chain to one hind leg,
Winch draws the chain up-
ward, the chain bites into the
leg and then hauls the ani-
mal into the air where it
dangles until its throat is cut.

***'

IT .IS THIS pre-slaughter
handling, no part at all of

 




, 1c
proposed Humane Slaughter
legislation seeks to elimini‘
nate.

I took to Albany letters .
from several prominent Roch-
ester people of the Jewish
faith urging Majority Leaders
Senator Walter J. Mahoney

and Joseph ‘F. Carling: to sup-
iport the Humane Slaughter
; Bills. T h e se Rochesterians
i were very sure the Calli and_
Conklin Bills in no way in-
fringed on religious freedom.

There is now a most humane
pre-handling device available
for Kosher slaughtering. This
device has been approved by
Jewish rabbis, the meat in-
spection division of the United
State Department of Agricul-
ture, many meat packers, and
Thurnaruo suiﬁeties.

This l'ian.<l,l.ing pen is very
satisfactory for steers; it does
not work on calves or sheep.
But the humane slaughtering
bill sponsored by the New
York State Humane Associa-
tion states expressly that the

' provision of the bill will not
‘ become operative for calves or
sheep untilxa satisfactory de-
'Vice has been developed to
' restrain them for ritual
slaughter.

This statement was included
' in the bill so that there could
not possibly be the slightest
infringement of full religious
liberty to any group in New
York State.

focused on three aspects of Jewish
life—the biblical portion read in
the synagogue last Sabbath morn-
ing, the Conklin
H u m a n e
Slaughter bill
introduced in
the New York
State Senate,
and the last
phase - of ‘ the
Eichmann trial
in Jerusalem.
;On ﬁrst thought; ..
their concur-we '-

Arence seemed‘to be a mere coin-
cidence and without the remote-st
connection. On further thought,
however, one is surprised to dis
"cover that their synChronization
could not have been more'ﬁtting
if it had been de‘lib‘eratly designed,
and that they are interlinked by
an inherent logical relationship.

_ The _ Biblical Portion
r In the biblical portion of last
Sabbath morning the Torah set
forth the various categories of ani-
mals, fowl. and ﬁsh that are per-
mitted or . forbidden as food for
Jewish consumption. These bibli-
cal laws were further supple-
;mented by talmudic regulations.
' includnig those of Shehitah—that
is, the rules governing the precise
manner of slaughtering and the
qualiﬁcations Of the 'slaughterer
1(Shohet).

The general aim of thesebiblical
laws and :of the institutoin of
ifKashruth in. general is stated in
the 'Bibl-ewwith, the utmost clarity:

Humane Slaughter Laws
Despite the exalted purpose of
these biblical- laws, . some European
countries have enacted statutes
virtually forbid Jewish

quently this Swiss measure became

tries. The phrasing of such ’IaWSI
does not mention the Jewish
method speciﬁcally, but by de-
manding that slaughtering be. me
ceded by‘stunning, which is con“
trary to 'Halachah, the effect is
the virtual prohibition "of Jewish
Shehitah. , . : . ,

The motive. for; such European
anti-Shehitah laws "is supposed
purely humane, but more probably
anti-Semiticxlin‘lBQé the Jewish
Society for the Defense. and Fur-
therance of Shehitah published a
book in Germany which cite-d 253
authorities—including 50 univers
ity .professors,,,14 directors of vet-

 

erinary schools, and 151 'medical
specialists in animal pathology—-
who asserted that ritual slaughter:
ing is. notpain inflicting; butthe
opponents 0f Shehitah were not in
the least moved to .relent in their
opposition. , g

Hence it is quite understandable
why Kashruth-observing Jews are
alarmed when socalled humane.

legislatures of our various states.
Though the proposed laws always
speciﬁcally: exempt Jewish ritual
slaughter, the effect on» Shehitah
of the newly required precautions
and methods- aredeﬁniteiy restric-
tive in character.

‘ This year the Conklin Bill pro-
posed in New York’s State Senate
fortunately-died in committee; but
it is quite certain that the pro
ponents of such laws—will not give
up the battle. and will continue to
agitate .in the, press: and lobby in
legislative bodies. It therefore be-
hooves Kashruth—observing Jews to
be likewise perpetually . alert in
defense of their cherished religious
principles and» practices.

REFLECTIONS DURING THE
EIGHMANN TRIAL

In the course of the long months
(if the Eichmann trial, which is
in its ﬁnal phase before

‘ They' will discuss th H ne
Whill and mm
c osmg issue, both of which came
up in the recent session of the
New York State legislature. The
Slaughter bill deals with the
preparation of meat for kosher
use, while the Sunday-closing is-

serve the sabbath by closing
their places of business and
therefore 'wish to remain, open
on Sundays instead. .

‘ One of the “ central unifying principles of the Christian and __
Jewishreligions is their‘exaltation ofmercy, of kindness, as a
cardinal virtue. On this point the Old Testament,'the New
Testament, the Torah and the Talmud proclaim the same Law.

“Blessed are the merciful,” say the Beatitudes. “And what
doth the Lord. require of thee,” says the prophet Micah,
“but, to do justly- and to love mercy and to walk humbly

with thy God.”

Unfortunately, and unnecessarily, it has been. made to seem
to some persons that there is a division between Jews and
other citizens of New York State in current debate in the
Legislature over legislation that has mercy and kindness as
its sole aim. Bills introduced by Senator William T. Conklin
and Assemblyman Luigi jl‘il'arano, to require use of lutmane
methods in slaughtering livestock, are being opposed. by
some rabbinical groups and some organizations of J ews,

Opponents of this highly desirable legislation are telling
legislators that the Conklinsll'flarano bills would {’i’outlawi5
ritual slaughter of animals and’that virtually all Jews of
New York State oppose the bills. ’ ‘

Truth
The Conklin-Marano bills specifically and unambiguously

define slice/rim, the laws of ritual slaughter of animals, as
humane. 'Both bills absolutely protect every religion.

,W hat these bills would outlaw is a savage cruelty that was
invented and, is practiced. only by prefit-hungry packers.
The lnfut'alities at which the legislation is aimed certainly
are no requirement of Jewish religious law. Those who
defend cruelty in the name of Judaism are guilty of libel
against Jewish law and tradition. a'

It should also be obvious that. no organization. or group of
organizations speaks for all of the Jews of New York State,
Yet there is real danger that the Cenklin-Marano bills will
be defeated simply because many legislators have been told
that Virtually all New York Jews oppose them.

 

 

The. purposes of these hills have been endorsed by leading '

bodies and publications of the Methodist Church, the Ameri-
can Council for Judaism, the National Catholic Society for
Animal Welfare, the Church of Christ, Scientist, the General
Federation of Women’s Clubs, and hundreds of other or=
ganizations. it will be a tragedy if the New York Legislature
refuses mercy to the animals that feed and clothe us under
a mistaken impression that such mercy would be offensive
to New York Jews.

Action

Let; our legislators know that behind "thi

is legislation there is
unity of Jews, Christians and every other, religion and segment
of “the people of New York. Telegraph, telephone or, write
to your Assemblyman and Senator today, urging that the
Conklin-Marano bills be passed, Telephone any borough or

Rabbi Blinnenthal Offers Rebuttal

In Slaughtering Law Controversy

The Daily Argus:

WILL YOU please permit me
,to reply to the statement made
by .Mrs. Christine Stevens on
April 17?

Some 30 years ago, “The Jun-
gle,” by Upton Sinclair, shocked
America by its disclosures of the
brutal and barbaric methods em-
ployed in the slaughter of ani-
mals for humanfood. One" still

retains images of cattle being»

. bludgeoned by sledge hammers
, before killing, and of swine being
thrown into scalding water while

still alive.

None of these and other bru-
J‘tali‘ties exist: in the slaughter of.
1 animals for kosher food. Religious
law prescribes a method of
slaughter which brings instantan-
' eous and painless death. To vio-
late this procedure is to render
the meat unfit: for consumption
by observant Jews.

I asserted in an earlier letter
that the bills then pending before
the New York State Legislature
would have made it impossible
for us to continue to prepare
kosher meat in New York State.
Mrs. Stevens asserts that my “al-
legations” are “unfounded.” Had
the Conklin bill become a law,
there would be no kosher meat:
in New York State after Jan. 1,
1963.

MRS. STEVENS confuses the
problem by her references to
shackling and hoisting, ito a 'hu-
mane pen. and to the approval
of the Synagogue Council of Am-
erica.

The Synagogue Council of. Am-
erica is a co-ordinating agency
for the six national organizations
of the three branches of Judaism,
Orthodox, COnservative and Re-
form. It_ was my privilege to
serve as president of one of the
three national Rabbinic bodies in
the Synagogue Council of America

 

 

.have

 

and at: present, I am a delegate
from it to the Synagogue Coun
cil of America. The simple trut

of the matter is that the Syn
agogue Council of America ha
discussed the problems of shack '
ling and hoisting with the hu
mane societies. At considerabl.
cost: to the Jewish community
we, and not the humane societies
commissioned researct
projects and have experimente
with all kinds of pens for holdin;
cattle. We have engaged in ne

gotiations with the humane so
cieties in an effort to arrive at .
consensus and a common pr

cedure. These have failed pri
marily because people like Mrs

Stevens presume to determin-
that Jews shall do without kosher
food. Jews do not instruct Roman
Catholics or Protestants about
their respective religious rites.
We believe that the American
people agree with us in expect-
ing a similar reticence on the
part of non - Jews towards our

religious practices. .

If Mrs. Stevens is alert to any
of the things that have happened,
she knows that my charge is
true. Had the Conklin bill be-
come a law, there would not be
any kosher meat in New York
State after Jan. 1, 1963.

This is not the first time that
these societies have attempted to
foist their particular solutions up-
on the American community. The
scandal of. their anti - vivisection-
ist propaganda against the medi-
cal profession and research still.
lingers in memory. ‘

 

IT IS UNFORTUNATE that a
commendable concern for the al.-
leviation of unnecessary pain to
animals must be accompanied
by a. callous indifference to the
needs of human beings.

WITH RESPECT to urban re-
newal, eternal vigilance is the
prize of liberty. It is, imperative
that all should realize that in-
stead of bona fide changes for
public improvement, urban re-
newal threatens to disrupt busi-
ness and business properties. It
is the “glittering promise” of
urban renewal which brings cost-
ly planning mistakes, broken
down and bitter disappointments
as promises tarnish.

Richard J. Whalen in “Plann-
ers, Politicians and People” says
that every community that un—
dertakes urban renewal can ex-
pect a cruel blow at small busi-
ness, as proved from the experi-
ence of disruption that occurred
in New Haven.

Mr. Whalen explains that the
planners’ standard reply to com-
plaints about high’handed tactics
which prevent an individual from

The Daily Argus: ' ~

PERMIT ME to commend th
Argus for printing the exchange
of correspondence between Mrs.
Stevens and me about humane
slaughtering. Perhaps in this way
we can contribute to an under-
standing of the issues involved.

Had the bills as originally in-
troduced in the Congress of the
United States in 1958, or in the
New York Legislature in 1959,
1960 and 1961 been passed, they
would have marked the end of
kosher meat in New York State.
There were no handling pens
available then. This, however, did
not deter the various societies
from pressing for the legislation.
I referred to this as a “callous
indifference to the needs of hum-
an beings.” There can be no ar-
gument about these conclusions.
The development of holding
pens looked more promising early
in 1962. The Jewish community
embarked upon a research proj-
ect conducted by the Armour Re-
search Foundation of the Illinois
Institute of Technology late in
1959, iOr the purpose of deVelop~

embers of the various humane
societies also examined and ap-
proved of them. The Department
of Agriculture, however, found
them to be unacceptable'for vari-
ous reasons. Finally, Cross Bros.
of Philadelphia, which is engaged
in the business of kosher slaugh-
tering, developed a pen which 1s
acceptable. Food Handling Ma-
chinery Corp, also of Philadel-
phia, to which Mrs. Stevens re-
ferred, only recently has been
designated as the company to
manufacture the pens. Whether
the pens will be available in
large numbers before Jan. 1, 1963
still is a moot question. There
certainly was no way of know-
ing whether they would be avail-
able at all when the Conklin Bill
was introduced. I maintain that
the animal protective societies
should have waited until we had
been assured that the supply of
kosher meats would not be in-
terrupted before insisting upon the
legislation. Furthermore, smaller
animals also are suspended be-
fore slaughtering. Pens must be
devised for this purpose and there
is not even a working model for
a smaller pen.’
But this does not get to the
l eart of the problem as a large
.egment of the Jewish commun-
ty sees it. Mrs. Stevens’ Soc1ety
for Animal Protective Legislation
is only one of many in the field.
ey are“ extremely well organ-
f zed both nationally and interna-
ionally. They meet regularly in
international conventions. Unfor—
u'nately, humane slaughtering le-
1'slation has an ugly history in
I urope‘. It has been espoused by
-very vicious anti - semitic ele-
n. ent in the gutters of European
thought. The humane societies
cannot be proud of the fact that
the Nazis championed their cause
and enacted their legislation as
soon as they had the power to
do so. The backwash of this loath-
;some episode is still with us.
As recently as April, 1962, the
German Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals in Ham-
burg called upon the Bonn Gov-
ernment to outlaw kosher slaugh-
tering. The meeting in Hamburg
Witnessed a demonstration of the
“brutal act” of kOSher animal

societies in. this country, that

Rabbi Blumenthal Comments Again
On Controversy Over Slaughtering

ritual slaughter is among the
most humane.

2A102 Rabbi Blumenthal tk 2-3

HERE LIES the true rub of
the matter. The history of this
kind of legislation in Europe in-
dicates that the real objective is
the elimination of kosher slaugh-
tering. For the time being let
us ignore the many illustrations
on the Continent. The example
of enlightened England will suf-
fice. On July 28, 1933, a law was
passed in England providing for
the electrical stunning of all ani-
mals before slaughter, with a
clear proviso exempting animals
for Jewish and Mohammedan
slaughter. In December, 1954, a
bill was introduced to abolish
this exemption. The bill did not
pass but its proponents returned
to the assault. The Royal Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals published a pamphlet
titled “Leaglized Cruelty.” On
the cover is a drawing of
a bearded ritual slaughterer
armed with a long knife, stand-
ing near j a Weinberg pen from j
which the head_of1_an' animal '
prot" des. The” ,of 'h‘ef'Wein—f

against ritual slaugh-
ter as such. Similar attacks have
been made in the Dominion of
Canada. . .

Will the same thing happen”
here? It is easy for others "to 7
reassure us, but I hope that we
will be forgiven for being sus-
picious, in View of the interna-
tional associates of‘our humane
societies. .

These suspicions are reinforced
by the failure of the societies to
address themselves to a far more
cruel problem. The issue of a
holding pen versus hoisting is a
simple one. It concerns the man-
ner in which a number of ani-
mals are to spend the last few
moments of their lives. . .wheth-
er they are to be hemmed into
a pen and slaughtered, or wheth-
er they are to be suspended by
a leg and slaughtered. Not a sin-
gle animal life will be spared
if the decision goes one way or
the other.

‘ THE POSITION of the Jewish
community is a simple one.
Briefly stated it is as follows:
Legislation was necessary to eli-'
minate the .unspeakable cruelties
practised in the slaughter of non-
kosher animals. This has been
done. Legislation is not neces-
sary to solve the problems in-
volved in kosher slaughtering. As
soon as holding pens or any oth-
er improving devices are avail-P,
able, they will be introduced by
the Jewish community. In view
of the history of this kind of legis-
lation, we are opposed to any out-
side intrusion ,' in this area. If
this voluntary efforton our part
should fail, it is my personal
opinion that a large proportion
of the Jewish community will
press for the necessary legisla-
tion. with or without the humane
socieites.

.In the meantime, the humane.
societies can help in the process
of'persuasion They certainly can
address themselves to the prob-
lem of saving animal lives. They
will be surprised by the number of
Jews who would be glad to join
them. ~

Currently there are three.” bills being prepared in
Albany. State Sen. William Cohklin of Brooklyn, Assem-
blymen Anthony P. Savarese of Queens and William S.
Calli of Oneida have readied bills aimed at alleviating
unnecessary cruelty but safeguarding religious ritual killing.
In essence the bills provide that no slaughterer, packer
or stockyard operator “shall shackle, hoist or otherwise
bring livestock into position for slaughter, by any method
which shall cause injury or pain, nor bleed or slaughter
any livestock except by humane methods.” The laws
would insure slaughtering by humane methods andthese
would be according to requirements of Jewish or other
religiOus faiths. The bills define a humane method to
mean that an animal is rendered insensible to pain by
rapid and effective means before being slaughtered.

A Canadian packing firm has now deveIOped a device
that will enable kosher packers to abandon shackling and
hoisting of live cattle and still comply with religiOus
doctrine. It is a simple, inexpensive holding pen or re-
straining frame that holds the animal’s head in proper
position ' for the shochet. This device has rabbinical
approval. ' , ‘ '

. ﬁugﬁtering Bill Called

. .ALBANY (AP).

The Jewish Community Council of Albany announced . I
yesterday its opposition to a bill before the Legislature
that is aimed at making the slaughter of animals more
humane. , . ‘

Executive director Ed. Phillips called the measure a
serious threat to religious liberty. It would'make Jewish
ritual slaughtering impossible, he said.

‘The standard practice in ritual Jewish slaughtering
is to shackle the animal and hoist it off the floor while it
is still conscious and then cut the arteries leading to the
head. .'

, A section of the bill, Mr. Phillips said, forbids shack-
-ling or hoisting an animal into position for slaughter “by
any method which shall cause injury or pain.”

He said a possible alternative method of restraining

For” Humane Slaughter

An Editorial From
The Auburn Citizen-Advertizer

The federal humane slaughter law enact-
ed in 1958 applies only to plants selling meat
to the federal government.

Hence the Council of State Governments
has drafted a model bill which is needed to,
extend protection from cruel, painful slaught—

Twelve states now have adopted this
law, but New York is not among them. That
is why State Sen. Conklin (R-Brooklyn) has

introduced such a bill in the Legislature. It
has the approval of humane organizations
and should be passed.

' ering methods to meat animals not protected
by the federal law.

The model bill requires that meat animals
oe rendered'insensible to pain before being
shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, knifed, bled.

scalded, or skinned. Packers may use any of
the following methods: carbon dioxide anes-

. thetization, captive-bolt pistols, gunshot or

‘ electric stunning. All of the methods are hu-
mane, efficient and economical.

Congress already has established that hu- I
mane slaughter methods, in addition to pre-
venting needless suffering of animals, “pro.
vide safer and better working conditions for
persons engaged in the slaughtering industry;
bring about an improvement of products and
economies in slaughtering operation; and ’I
produce. other benefits, for producers, proces-
sors and consumers which tend to expedite
an orderly flow of livestock and ' livestock g
products in interstate and foreign commerce.” I

Humane Slaughter Bill Urged

3Tb the Editor: State Senator Robert C.
McEwen of Ogdensburg and Assemblyman
Robert J. Feinlberg of Plattsburg have in-

troduced a bill for the humane slaughter .

of meat animals This measure is the model
bill recommended by the Council of State
Governments and was introduced at the re-

quest of the National Catholic Society for
Animal Welfare.

This proposed law is badly needed to
extend protection to animals not covered

by the federal law which applies only to
plants selling meat to the Federal govern-

‘ ment.

State humane slaughter bills have in the
past been opposed by some Jewish organi-
zations because the laws would prohibit the
shackling and hoisting of animals for ritual
slaughter, although ritual slaughter itself
is fully protected by the laws. Shackling
and hoisting is a packing house handling
method, not part of Shechita, ritual slaughter.

The Rabbinical Council of America in "

its «convention last June adopted a resolution
hailing the development of pens ‘ for the
restraint of animals in preparation for rit-
ual slaughter and called upon its members

to exert all efforts to have slaughterhouses
in their communities dispense with the
hoisting of animals and to adopt a method .
whereby animals are restrained through ac- .
ceptable pens.

The resolution noted that the Rabbinate
in Israel insists upon slaughter while the
animal is at rest or lying down to avoid
hoisting and that meat imported into Israel
must not have been produced through the
hoisting of animals.

Equipment for rendering animals insen-
sible to pain has been fully developed and
and is readily available to the packing
industry. But the packing induStry will not
voluntarily end its cruelty to animals, as
Congress found when it studied the matter
and concluded that the force of law was
necessary to protect meat animals New
Y01k must enact its own humane slaughter
law to extend protection to the millions of

animals not covered by the federal law.

Write your Assemblyman, State Senator
and Governor Rockefeller and ask them to
support the McEwen-Feinberg human e

slaughter bill and that you want it enacted
this session.

J ire-File

Congress, in 1958, passed a
humane slaughter law that
applies only to plants selling
meat to the federal govern-
ment. The bill’s standards
are based 011 federal law, the
objective being to make meat
animals “rapidly and merc1-
fully insensible to pain". at
the outset of processmg. The
slaughtering methods of the
Orthdox Jewish ritual 13 am-
ply safeguarded so there is
no question of abridging re-
ligious freedom.

In the words of the editor 1
of one of the largest daily
newspapers, “The abomina- :
tion of unnecessary cruelty;
to animals, and the effect on 1
man of permitting it” is the 1
most compelling reason for
presenting this bill, and it is
hoped that the legislature will
act favorably to correct the
nauseating practices followed
at present in; New York state
by some slaughter houses.

 

 

We are for the mest part, a meat-
eating people. We are also a people
dedicated to the eliminati0n of unneces-_
sary suffering by. any living creature.

Unfortunately, the two preferences
are not alwaysjreeonciled. 'Methods
used to slaughter meat«ﬁllilIlQii-‘i-ii1 New
York State are often needlesSly cruel.

’If slaughterhouses were exposed to

public viewing, no deeent citizen could
tolerate the suffering he would see
there. Terrified animals are shackled,
hoisted, knifed and left to die slowly,
their agony Often compounded by in-
juries sustained in their Wild struggles
against execution.

All this Suffering could be obviated ~
by a law requiring that animals be

‘made unconscious before, slaughtering.

. feci

Exposure to carbon dioxide, or other
simple anesthesia, will accomplish this
result quickly, cheaply and without af-
meat quality. 1 .

Laws have been introduced in Albany
toward this end in the past but public
apathy and localized opposition have
prevented passage This winter, Sen.
Robert C. McEwen and Assemblyman

’ Robert J. Feinberg have renewed the, 1
battle. Unless the public supports their
efforts, strongly, this bill, too may die 1‘

(mechanical, electrical or

fore shackling, hoisting,
sticking or bleeding. In the
case of ritual slaughter, it
declares that method hu-
mane, therefore fully pro-
tecting it from interference

and ensuring full religious

Fifteen states have so

Humane Slaughter

To THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR:

. The New York State Legislature-—
as well as other state assemblies—is at
this moment concerned with a Humane
Slaughter bill. '

This bill will protect about 90 per '
cent of the" meat animals in the state
from enduring the pain of hoisting and
shackling before slaughter. It would
supplement the federal Humane Slaugh-
ter bill. This year the chance that New
York will .join Oregon, Wisconsin, New
Hampshire, California, Washington, and
Minnesota in effective humane slaughter
bills is the best yet. But the bill can only
become law if voters make very clear to
, their state senators and assemblymen
that they wish this. bill passed.

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) The‘ ew-

announced Monday its opposition
to a bill before the Legislature

that is aimed at making the

slaughter of animals more hu-

Executive Director Ed Phillips

“called the measure a __ serious
Fthreat to religious liberty. It

would make Jewish ritual slaugh-

The standard practice in ritual -

Jewish slaughtering is to shackle
the animal and hoist it off. the

A section of ill, Phillip
said, forbids shacklin or hoisting
an animal into position for slaugh-

cause injury or'pain.”

Phillips said a possible alterna-
tivemethod of restraining anim-
als during slaughter had been
worked out but had not been ap-

N. Y. Kosher Meat

NEW YORK (J'TA)—-—N.ew J ew-
ish warnings were issued this
week that the Conklin Humane
Slagghtgr Bill, now pendinme
New Tor-k State Senate, would
prevent Jewish ritual slaughter in
the State by fonbidding shrackling
and hoisting of meat animals prior
to slaughter.

The Jewish Community Rela-
tions Committee of Uti-ca said that
the Conklin bil>1——-an.d a companion
Calli bill in the State Assembly
«specifically exemept schechita as
a humane method of killing. The
committee added, however, that
since there are not now any means
of pre-handling available to New
York albbattoirs, other than shack-
ling and hoisting, which would not
interfere with schechita, the prac-
tical effect of passage of the mea-
sures would be to halt all kosher
meat provisions within the state.

The same point was made by
the National Council of Young Is-
rael, which declared: “The Conk-
lin bill was cleverly worded in that,
in theory, it does not prevent
schechita- It does, however, pro-
hibi’t the shackrling and heisting of

Jewish Groups Oppose TWO
‘Humane Slaughter’ Bills In
New York State ‘

NEW YORK (JTA)———A resolus
t’on declaring that two humane
slaughter bills now befom,
mew ork State Legislature posed‘
‘a grave danger to the religious
liberties of a large segment of the}
Jewish population” of the state
was endorsed by 13 local, state;
and national Jewish religious andj
c-vic organizations.

The National Community Rela—
tions Advisory Council, coordinate
ing agency for the organizations,
said the resolution urged the re-
jection of the Calli and Conklin
bills as “ill advised and prema—
ture.” A copy of the resolution,
with a. covering letter from the
Synagogue Council of America,
was sent to each member of the
Legislature.

The resolution noted that the
bills—one introduced by State
Sen. William Conklin of Brooklyn

‘

 

and one by Assemblyman William
Calli of Oneida county —— “spe-
cifically” recognized the humane-
ness of schechita, Jewish ritual,
slaughter. However, the resolution
contended, the bills required meth-l
ods of pre-handling of food ani-i
mals “which will make impos-l
.sible the continuance of this Jew-i
ish religious practice.” I
The resolution also said tha
“the organized Jewish communit
of America has engaged in very!
extensive research toward the de—,
velopment of the most humane
device for the restraint of ani
mals in preparation for schechita
When fully practical mechanisms
for both large and small animals
are available, we shall exert ourl
best efforts to insure their ac-l
ceptance and utilization by slaughi
ter houses in New York and other

states,” the resolution said.

II
'Blue Laws' Battle:

Campaigns for an intensiﬁcation of the enforcement of Sun-
day closing laws are now being stepped up in a mimber of states,
resulting in police action against Sabbath obseri'ing Jews who
keep their establishment closed on Saturdays but open on Sun»
days. . . . In some parts of the country pressure is now being
exerted upon legislators to enact new and stronger ordinances
prohibiting work and business on Sundays. - . . Support for such,
legislation generally comes from church groups. from city mere
chants and from unions of retail clerks and salespeople. . . .
Opposition gei‘ierally comes from highway merchants. Jewish
organizations and other Seventh—day Sabbatarians. . . . The
American Jewish Congress is now trying to secure exemption.
from the Sunday closing law for Sabbath observers in New ‘York,
Massachusetts and Maryland. , . . Such exemptions exist in Con-
necticut, Indiana, North Dakota. Iowa, Kentucky. Maine. Michi»
gan, Ohio. Oklahoma, Texas. Virginia, Vermont, West. Virginia
and Wisconsin. . . . About two-thirds of all states have laws
regulating Sunday commerce and others have delegated this
authority to local governments. - .. . The city merchant and
church groups seeking tougher police action against violators of
the Sunday closing laws have been greatly helped, by a 196}.
U. S. Supreme Court decision that Sunday statutes in three states
did not violate. the Constitution and were not religious laws. .. .
The. Supreme Court in eﬂ'ect said that. a. state legislature. in the.
exercise of its police power, has the, right to define which. activi—
ties will be permitted and which prohibited on Sundays. . . . The
Court also said that: Sunday laws. despite their clear religious
origin~—and despite the admitted fact that they favor the holy
day observed by the majorit.y-—-are secular . . . The Court also
held that Sunday laws do not violate the Constitution because
they fail to exempt from their strictures the activities of those
who observe. a day other than Sunday as their day of rest. . . .
Such a ruling of the Supreme Court has. naturally. stimulated
the supporters of the. "blue laws" to seek. stronger enforcement.

of these laws. . . . In New York. the. Jewish c rner groceries
have mostly become now the target of police action in the en-
forcement of the Sunday closing. law. . . The American Jewish
Congress. in arguments against this action, points out that if the.
law is to be enforced. it; should be enforced not only against the
, corner grocery but against all enterprises that operate on Sunday
in clear violation of the statute. . . . This would include radio
and TV stations that broadcast on Sunday newspapers whose:
editorial and mechanical stati’s work on Sunday; drug stores that
sell cosmetics. toys and similar items on Sunday; churches that:
conduct bingo games on Sunday; newsstands that sell books on
Sunday. etc. . . . The American Jewish Committee similarly ﬁnds
‘ the Sunday closing laws archaic and unreasonable in our modern
industrial society.
The Shehifa Issue:

Jewish organizations are anticipating that a number of hu~
_n_iane slaughter bills will be. introduced in state legislatures
during 1963 sessions. . .. . Humane societies are believed to be
preparing to submit. legislative proposals that may affect Shehita,
the religiously prescribed Jewish method of slaughtering animals.
.. . In this connection. it is worth noting that. kosher meat.
t ack‘ers .in this country have begun installation of a recently
erl'ected pen to hold large animals in position for slaughter in.
~cmrdance with the requirements of Shehita. . .. . The new pen—m
eveioped by a Philadelphia ﬁrm—~has been given Halachic sancw
wen. has been approved by the U. S. Department of Agriculture.
if d has. been endorsed by major humane societies. .. .. . it: is
itable only [or beef animals; research is proceeding on rem
raining devices for calves. sheep and lambs. . . . The Synagogue:
iouncil of America and the National Community Relations
dvisory Council are especially watching the intrmluction ot'
33 mane slaughter legislation in the states and their consultative
"rvices are available in comiection with all such proposed legisu

ltion. ‘

What Is Hui‘ma‘ne?

lished letters from people who support the Conk—

lin Bill which is now before the New York State .

Assembly.

Any bill which would help to alleviate the suf-
fering of animals which are slaughtered for»- meat
should have the full sup-port of everyone. However,
it is hard to see how the Conklin Bill will in any
way lessen the suffering of animals it is supposed
to benefit.

Its prohibition against shack‘ling and hoisting
won’t eliminate pain. Nor, at this point, would it
lessen the animal’s fright. This bill only makes it
virtually impossible to slaughter an animal (espe—
cially a steer)
way known: the ritual of slaughter practiced b y
Orthodox Jewry as a matter of strict enjoinder
against brutality.

This bill Would, however, permit continuance
of a commonly used slaughter method which I
once witnessed in uttefm‘ in which a man
repeatedly strikes a steer in the head with a sledge
hammer until the stunned and suffering animal
loses consciousness, after which he is bled to death.

M utter of Opinion

The Skybolt Case

The Baltimore Sun

In explaining the Administra-
tion’s decision to scrap the air-
borne Skybolt ballistic missile last
month President Kennedy rested
his case primarily on money. Al-
. ready $353 million had gone into
the Skybolt program, with the
prospect that $2 billion more
would be required to turn out the
1,000 productiOn models earmark-'
ed for the Air Force and the 100
promised to Great Britain. “There
is: just a limit to how much we
need, as well as how much we can
afford, to have a successful deter-
ent,” the President said.

If Skybolt were the primary
American weapon, instead of a
' variant, the ~United States would
'aﬂ’ord it. But already there are
Atlases, Titans, Minutemen, Po-
larises, and other s0phisticated
weapons in the defense arsenal,
and their support in a modern
militaryestablishment is pushing
the cost of the peace of the Sixties,
. higher than the cost of war in the
l-Forties. To most of the uPresi-
dent’s. ' audience, without ' Special
knowledge of defense require—
ments but with personal interest
, in tax reduction, Mr. Kennedy’s
reasoning made sense. , ..

Subsequent reports from. Wash-
ington, however, have tended to
sow confusion. ThexDecember 31
order canceling the Skybolt proj-
ect was. not accepted with good
'- grace at every ofﬁce in the Penta-
-’ gon, and one gets the impression
,; that the abandonment was against

. ,fthe advice of some of our, most

3respected generals. The new Con-
" ‘gre‘ss can be eXpected‘ to investi-

gate the Skybolt failure, and if it ~

dares depart from the routine in-
vestigativeeformula on this occa-
sion it can perform a real service.
Within "the limits of reasonable

security—used "as protection but ‘

.not as cover — it should cut”
through all the hints and self—
serving. arguments and sort. out
the facts for the public. The. issue
is too serious to drown in politics,
or in service rivalry. ’

 

Hope In Statistics

The Christian Science Monitor

.Over the New Year holiday
many Americans had- their atten-
tion momentarily called to that
contrivance at the Bureau of the
Census. which records the esti—
mated United States population
‘like the speedometer on some
huge vehicle that can never be
traded in on a new model. The
“census .clock” registered 188,038,-
656 on December 31; nearly 7,000
more the next day. .

The American population, which
some demographers of the late

’30’s thought would level off at;

about 150,000,000 and remain as
stable as France’s much-sung
40,000,000 Frenchmen, obviously
is not leveling off at all. But
neither .is it exploding quite so
fast as more recent demographers.
had predicted.

Hidden behind the big number
on the census clock are two small-
er but striking statistics that be-
speak a welcome trend toward
stability and maturity in Ameri-
can family life.

One is the decline in the divorce I

rate. This year, according to the
National Vital Statistics Division,
the divorce rate dropped 4.2 .per-
cent. .

It is always difﬁcult to resolve
statistics into human terms—par-
ticularly to interpret morality
from them. But nonetheless there
is cautious hope to be found in
this decline, even in a ﬁeld where
statistics are often incomplete.
‘ For this 1962- shrinkage, added to
the almost constant slow decline
in the divorce rate since 1946,

1

, means once again that a smaller

portion of American children will
grow up in broken homes. It pre-

sumably indicates "that 'a higher
percentage of married gAmericans '

came to their weddings with new
maturity—or achieved? it in the
wisdom-breeding task of making
capricious matches work through
mutual experience. .
This yearalso the highAmeri-
can birth rate has declined stead-
ily since J uly—a persistence long
enough for ofﬁcials to label “a
signiﬁcant downward trend.”

’Here' again statistics do not
readily translate into human
terms. But there is considerable
evidence from polls to indicate
that American parents nowadays
are planning their families with
more consideratiOn for .ducational _
opportunity and famil welfare.

» A few percentagepoints print-
ed from calculators iii Washing.
ton do not yet sign ”'1 a 'major
renaissance of family: standards.
But the two downturns do appear
to jibe. And if they cbntinue we

The New York ‘legislature
meets tomorrow (We nesday) to
hear Governor Rockefeller’s ﬁrst
annual message of his second term
and to begin a sessiofn that will
probably be long on eontroversy
and short on new money to spend.
Fortunately there are: many con-
,structive actionS/ the 3 legislature
can take that will not: cost much.
All they will require is some po-
litical courage. j

We: mention ﬁrst, then, some
needed measures that: do not re-
quire dollars: Constitutional re-
form, especially toward fairer re—
apportionment of legislative seats;
liberalization ' of New York’s un-
realistic divorce law; abolition of
capital punishment; abolition of

-revenue.

Recently. as you noted, the trees were cut from
Riverhead’s Main Street and now there is a prOposal

that it is exceedingly dangerous for the men‘ work-

marily interested in gaining support for the New

the fact that we do have a Federal HumaneSlaugh-

Mineola—Let me Congratulate Barbara Delatiner
on the steady quality of her reviews. I occasionally
disagree with her in varying. degrees-but have found
her approach to the items on television to be both
intelligent and well presented.

As to commercials, the only pleasing ones, in
the esthetic sense, that I haVe had the privilege
to view Were those by Es‘so when it sponsored “The

The Legislative Session

The 1962 session of the Neinork Legis-
lature, watched with especial interest as the
prelude to the state election, has made a rea-
‘ sonably good record.

Most important among the achievements was
rewriting of the formula for state aid to educa-
tion, redressing some old inequities, breaking
,‘ new ground in special assistance, and greatly
increasing dollar expenditure in the years im-
mediately ahead. The new formula is simpler
and fairer, especially to large cities. The test
.1 of time will doubtless find remediable imper-
‘ fections. But it is an improvement, for which
the Diefendorf committee and Governor Rocke-
feller should share congratulations.

‘. Concern over the State University’s halting
3 expansion, long bogged down in administrative
red tape and hesitant leadership, finally resulted
in creation of a new agency, or fund, to put _
. construction and to some extent financing under
independent initiative. Success of this maneuver
‘ will depend to considerable extent on new exec-
utive leadership brought in to expedite building.

On a variety of fronts the Legislature has
moved ahead, and in a generally progressive
spirit. A large bundle of housing bills, including
long-sought help to New York City, go to the
‘ Governor, many of them measures proposed by
him and some of novel approach. The World
Trade Center in lower Manhattan will be built,
in combination with modernization of the Hudson
' and Manhattan Railroad.

Legislation to deal intelligently with the
narcotics addict was passed. Court reorganiza-
, tion statutes, not ideal but better than antici— .

I ‘pated, were completed. The Korean »»War vet- '

erans’ bonus was defeated after a notably
courageous stand by Mr. Rockefeller. The State

Commission of Investigation was continued.

Bingo reform was begun. Highway safety and
air pollution control scored some advances. New
‘ York City is getting help in various forms,

7 including more power to borrow for new sub-

way cars.

It was a spending session, with idle talk of
a tax rebate quickly silenced. The Governor’s
proud pay—as-you-go policy was held intact only
by fiscal legerdemain, the aftermath to be reaped
in new taxation anxieties next year.

Governor Rockefeller’s leadership has been a
mixture of boldness and strategic retreat. He won ‘
much of what he went after in a program that i
. would be a platform for re-election. He delib-
erately set out to and did rob Mayor Wagner
f and the Democrats of such issues for November
, j as New York City rent control, milk-dating, and

“inadequate” aid to education (except for grad-

uate work at the City University, where the
‘ 7 $1,000,000 initial state grant is pretty slender).
' Disappointments this session promise to be con-

spicuous and manifold: Legislative ethics, grand

' jury presentments, new judges, prize-fight
abolition, a constitutional move for reapportion-
. ment, collective bargaining for employes of non-
. profit services, rail full-crew laws, Condon—
Wadlin revision, meter-maid powers, divorce law
liberalization, permanent personal registration,
- humane slaughter, billboard control and aid to

museums as educational institutions. These are

only samples of work expected to be left undone.
» After the Governor struggles through his thirty-
day bill signing period, a special session that met
some of these evaded problems with courage
would do him and his party more good than
campaigning.

Animal

By VEE GUTHRIE

it Do you want to put an end t
cruelty in the slaughter of foo
animals .in New York State? ll
we f“. "or humane slaughter.
this s the time to say so! Put
,your name on a petition, this
have “prepared these petitions,
which you may sign in either
Hudson or Catskill. .

The petitions ask that legis-
lation be passed to provide that
the animals must be humanely
rendered unconscious before
slaughter. This will at least
spare them the torture of being
shackled and hoisted by one
leg while conscious. A well-
known rabbi is one of the Spon-
sors of the petitions, along with
,humanitarians of other faiths.
New York State has been a lagg‘
ard in passing humane slaughter
legislation, but it is high time
that we joined the ranks of the
other progressive States in this
basic matter of compassion.

Greene County residents may
sign the humane slaughter peti—
tion at McDonald’s Book Ends,
125 Water St, next to New-
berry’s parking lot, Catskill.

Petitions are available to C01-
umbia County residents at the
. following places: Harry Car-
hart’s Men’s Shop at Simmons
Plaza; Craig Thorn’s Insur-
ance Office on Green St; and of
course, the Shelter, on N .Y. 66,
one mile north of Hudson. Please
lose no time in signing. To be
effective. the petitions must be
sent off within a week from to—
day!

Kindness has many aspects.
Many >rsons believe it is un—
kind to confine a dog, despite
traffic hazards or damage to pro
perty of other persons. Last week
a group ofdogs, running free, or
perhaps the word is wild, kill
ed an elderly pet cat.

Again we urge all owners to
restrain their pets, either on
lead, or by fencing them into

mes

Corner-

their own yards. Observance of
this “Good Neighbor” policy
will promote the public happiv
ness and will also provide long
er life for the dogs themselves.

Can anybody spare a type
writer for the shelter office?
It is essential for” the keeping
of records. but there are no
funds available. The sheiter
has been running in the red for
months. Donations are always
more than welcome. and are
tax-deductible. Checks should
beg'made out to the Columbia
County Humane Society, Box
424, Hudson.

A male Irish Setter has been
missing from Ghent for one
month. He has been seen in
Greenport since then. Please
call the shelter,.if you have
any clue as to his-wixeresalynits.

if you i’lAJe 10.31. a pet of, any
description, call or go to the -
shelter at once. It iS also a good
idea to check back every few
days. Often animals turn up
after having been lost for weeks
so it pays to be persistent in
looking for them.

The shelter has beautiful
cats and dogs. puppies and
kittens for adoption this week.
Space prevents our giving
details. We can only say, go and
see!

zer. the greatest humanitarian

* egislature’s

By ROBERT A. POPA

Of Our Lansing Bureau

LANSING, June 29.—-——A labor
leader’s suit in the State Su-
{reme Court lies behind the

egislature’ s confused depar-
._\'ture from Lansing last night.
Normally, th e Legislature
‘1,"icompletes its business and re-
turns 30 days later for final ad-
journmentmlargely a bookkeep
ing action to take care of any
details that might have been
overlooked.

But when the lawmakers
packed their bags last night,
they p1 om1sed to return July 26
and threatened to extend the al-
ready extraordinary s e s s i o 11
until Dec. 27.

FEAR COURT ACTION

Last nighs’ts surprising deci-
1 grows out of senators’ fears
a Supreme Court suit to re-
' ‘apportion the Senate.
/ Opening arguments in that
case instituted by August.
Scholle, president of the State
AFL-CIO, will be heard by the
court Monday.

A ruling is expected this sum-
mer. It could be an order to
redistrict the Senate.

That’s why the Legislature
wants to remain in session tech-
nically, even if it doesn’t have
anything to do. The Legislature
could adjourn July 26 or any
time after that up to Dec. 27.

Rep. Robert E. Waldron (R-
Grosse Pointe) explained that
the Legislature was giving itself
“elbow room.”

TOPICS LIMITED

' If the Legislature adjourns
finally, there are two ways it
can be recalled.

The governor can call a spe-
cial session. or a special. com-
mittee of the Legislature can
summon it back.

In a special session called by
the governor, he gets to name

the subject and limit the topics

under debate. .
Calling a session through 1a

special committee is time-con-

- suming. . .
But, by postponmg adjourn-

fnent, the Legislature can come.

* pom-111:5 CHARGED
ills-iiienator John P. Smeekens (R—
do dw,ater) suggested that Dec.
'27 be set as the date for final
adjournment.

“Unless we go into this type
of recess we are without ma-
chinery to cope with the special
problems that confront us,”
Smeekens said.

Senator Raymond D. Dzend-
zel, of Detroit, acting Demo
cratic floor leader, charged tha

‘ited to action on only certain

 

 

the move had “political impli-
cations.”

“ T h e y (Republicans) don’ t
want the governor to call us
back into special session,” he
charged. ,

Smeekens replied that keep-
ing the Legislature technically
in session thrOugh December
was intended as insurance in
case Gov. Swainson chose not to
call a special sessibn after the
Supreme Court ruling.

Whether the governor has the
power to call a special session
when the Legislature has not ad-

pute.
In the House, Rep. Wilfred G.

Bassett (R- Jackson) argued that ‘

keeping the Legislature techni-
cally in session until Dec. 27

“will give you complete control
to introduce any legislative pro-
gram you want and not be lim-

specified programs. ”

The measure finally passed.

in both houses.

Senator Patrick. J. Doyle (D-
Dearborn) called the action.

“This is the most ridiculous

in the Legislature,” said Dzen-d
zel.

“The majority party has come
up with a new way of gumming
up the works," said Senator
George C. Steeh (D - Mt.‘
Clem.ens)

Democrats were joined by
Senator Charles R. F eenstra
(R—Grand Rapids), who, accused
fellow senators of being “afraid”
of a special session.

Feenstra is concerned because
of annexation problems that will

 

arise in his district unless bills
passed this year. take effect
before Dec. 31.

“Unless these bills take ef-
fect Dec. 31, every school dis-

trict in Kent County is upset,”

 

Feenstra warned.
Rep. Joseph A. Gillis Jr. (D-

Detroit) called the action a
shabby political trick.”

g to use painless slaughtering
‘ methods,” Mrs. Videla declared.

.She noted that up-to-date pack- ,
1mg. houses run on modern prin-
ciples, such as Hormel and Stalls
meier, have voluntarily adopted
humane slaughter procedures,
sparing the animals unneeded
tortures and saving money at the
same time by avoiding condem-
natiOn of thousands 0f tons of
meat.

“In the barbaric .‘process ‘now
used in countless slaughter-'
houses," she said, “small ani-
mals, such as lambs, calves and
h0gs, are shackled by a hind
leg after being herded to a shack-
ling pen. .

‘,‘Frightened by rough handling, ‘
rthe smell of blood and the cries
of their fellow creatures, the ani-
mals frantically try to escape the
man who enters the-crowded pen
to attach a ’chain to their legs,

“The shackle ﬁnally in place'
and hooked to an overhead mov-
ing chain, the hog,ﬁlamb of calf
’ is dragged from the ground by
a hind leg as it is: conveyed to
another part of the j room. From
where, it is~ hoisted Wﬂe stick-

“When the animal finally ar-
rives at the killing area, it is
stuck in the throat with a knife
in a manner that induces Slow
bleeding. The animals are con-
scious until death results from
bleeding. ”

Mrs. Videla said that in hu-
mane slaughterhouses animals
walk into ,a tunnel filled With
carbon dioxide. After inhaling
the harmless, odorless gas, they
emerge unconscious and remain
insensible to pain throughout the
sticking and bleeding until
death results from blood loss.

“If you are opposed to cruelty

Slaughter Law

Hopes Increase

By WILLIAM

Of the World-Telegram Staff

uiAnlunal. lovers who have
fought for 80 years for a hu-
mane slaughter law in New
York are hopeful that this ses-
siOn of the Legislature finally
will pass such a bill_

The state now has no law
covering the slaughter of meat
animals and sometimes they
die in terrible anguish. More
than a dozen humane slaughter
bills have died in legislative
committees in the last six
years. .

Much of the opposition to
such legislation is said to have
come from Jewish religious
leaders whe see the measures
as a threat to the ritualistic or
kosher method of slaughtering
animals, know as Shechita.
Actually the kosher method
itself is said to be humane, but
the inhumanity is in the posi-

 

Four Bills Pending
The Legislature now has be-

 

LONGGOOD

veloped restraining pens which
can eliminate ' hoisting and
shackling in kosher slaughter;

Mapel said the exemption of
small plants also would protect
freedom of religion in ritual
slaughter.

The positioning pens are said ,
to sell for about $10,000. Mapel “
said a similar pen is, not yet
available for, smaller animals 3
but one is being developed.

A similar pen is not yet-
availalble for smaller animals
but one is being developed, ac-
cording to Mapel.

Mrs. Sachmi‘d insisted that no
animal should suffer for eco-
nomic reasons, and she accused
the ASPCA of accommodating
the packers at the expense of
animals. She said one packer
slaughtered 3800 lambs and
calves a day by manual hand-
ling, without hoisting and
shackling, and this method can
be used now While a restrain-
ing."‘pen for small animals is
being developed.

 

 

w.—

 

tered. Schochet Benjamin Ro-
sen recently described the
present method of kosher
slaughter in the Jewish News-
letter, calling for an end to
“this evil.” ‘

He explained that the con,
scious animal is hoisted by at
chain wrapped around its hind
legs. One foreleg is then se-
sured to a wall by pulley and

: hooks, and the head is pulled
iin the oppOsite direction by
an iron hook inserted in the
animals nostril. He said “The
ianimal screams and bellows
iwith agonizing pain until the
gShochet cuts its throat,’ thus

putting it out of its misery. . . .”

The ASPCA bill would elimi-
nate the shackling and hoisting
of. large beef animals in prep-

use of manually operated ham-
mers, sledges or pole axes.

By Frederick W. Roevekamp .
Staff Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor

New York
Legislation for humane
slaughter, a last-spreading
miwcment in the United States
in recent. years, has come to a
near stand here. \
' A humane-slaughter bill is

being kémii'twhim 'c‘Ommittce “ in '

the state Legislature in Al-
bany because of the opposition
of Jewish groups. They argue
that‘ it indirectly threatens
their. right to eat kosher meat.

The contrbversy is heated but
goes on mostly ‘behind the
scenes. This may well be due
to the recognition by most peo-
ple concerned that the com—
plexities of this issue with all
its inflammable aspects invites
ready misunderstanding.

Controversy’s Focus

What is being debated is not
whether shechita. as the Jew-
ish ritual slaughter is called,
is more or less humane than
other methods. Humane groups
backing the bill agree, and the
bill under consideration spe—
ciﬁcally declares, that shechita
is a humane method,

The controversy revolves
‘ around the method of. “hoisting
and shackling"——transporting
the animals while conscious
suspended by a leg in as-
sembly-line fashion—to the
spot in the plant where they
are slaughtered. This involves
severe cruelties, humane socie—
ties say, especially for heavy
animals.

Hoisting and shackling was
.common practice among pack-
ers until the pressure of public
opinion led to‘ application of
. ways of stunning the animals
before hanging them up.

Federal Law Passed

Four years ago, a federal law
was passed which made this
anasthesia mandatory for all
packers doing business with
the United States Government.

Humane-group leaders estir

mate that the federal law af-
fects about 80 to 90 per cent of
the meat produced in the
United States. The remaining
packers are mostly small ﬁrms
not doing any government busi-
ness and those producing kosher
meat. .

Kosher producers were spe-
ciﬁcally exempted by the fed-
eral measure due to a last-
minute amendment by Sens.
Clifford P. Case of New Jer-
sey and Jacob K. Javits of
New York.

Dilemma Seen

Behind the amendment was .

the concern of. Jewish groups,

" particularly Orthodox ones,
which said they were in a Se-
rious dilemma.

Hebrew ritual requires that
animals are slaughtered before

"being stunned. Experts say that
shechita involves no excesswe
suffering. This is why humane
groups concede the method to
be humane.

But some Jewish leaders say
no reliable and economic alter-
nate method has been developed
for transporting cattle to the
slaughter spot. To ban heistmg

and shackling, therefore, would ; sored by Sen.

  

 

 

, last week:

 

involved resulted in a wide-
spread mistaken notion that
hoisting and shackling are an
inherent part of shcchita, Jew-
ish leaders explain.

Pen Developed

Now, however, a restraining
pen has been developed to re-
place hoisting and shackling
to the satisfaction of all—4rab-‘
bis, Department of Agriculture
inspectOrs, and humane groups.
It was developed by Cross
Brothers, 3 Philadelphia firm.

This is a major reason why
the humane bill in Albany this
year calls for a ban on hoisting
and shackling. It would give
packers time until January,
1964, to install. alternate de-
vices, presumably the Cross
Brothers pen.

Jewish opposition neverthe-
less has remained strong. The
Synagogue Council of Amer-
ica, .which is described as the
Jew1sh counterpart to the
Protestant National Council of
Churches, says it objects to
being srngled out in legislation,
even in an approvmg fashion.

. Compulsion Opposed

Dr. Philip Hiat, who has
represented the Synagogue
Council of America at public
hearings in Albany, said here

“We are against solving this
by legislation. Many packers
have started to reform without
compulsion. We prefer the
nongovernmental approach.”

Humane leaders, among

 

 

them Mrs. Christine Stevens,
secretary-treasurer of the So—
cicty for the Animal Protective
Legislation, disagree: -

“Packers have been slow in
self-reform,” she said. “When
Hormel [a large meat-packing
concern] introduced the hu-
mane method most other com-
panies did not follow until they
were compelled to.

“Legislation is needed in this
ﬁeld. This is why there is a
federal law.”

- N.Y. Bill Watched

Humane leaders, including
those of the Humane Society of
the United States, the National-
Catholie Society for Animal
Welfare, and other major
groups, regard the New York

 

bill this year as a pivotal phase
in the attempt to bring all meat
production under a humane
code.

There are some Jewish lead-
ers, who strongly disagree with
what they call the “strictly
Orthodox” resistance to legis-
lation against shackling and
hoisting.

Among these are leaders of
the'American Council for Ju-
daism, a relatively small Jew-
ish group. It holds that Zion-
ist organizations have used the
popularity of Israel for making
themselves the spokesmen for
American Jewry," which, the
council charges, they are not.

:Case of Opponentsof Metcalf-Hatch

37,1 Bill' Stated . q " ‘
To THE EDITOR or THE NEW YORK TIMES:

We read with interest Dr. Walter
Riker’s letter of , March 13 to The
Times. about .the Metcalf-Hatch
Iggy. This law is muc‘h‘muhderf
stood. Its purpose is net to au-
thorize vivisection, which has been
permitted in this state since the last
century. It is a procurement law,
authorizing requisitioning of. ani-
mals from shelters supported partly
by public funds.

Many consider this law a viola.-
tion of the Bill of’ Rights. The
Christian Science Monitor in an edi-
torial stated, “* * * the Speaker of
the Assembly- [Oswald Heck] is re-‘
ported to have declared that A,
questions of constitutionality Could
not be considered against medical
science.” The editorial went on,
“If medicine continues to be placed
above the 'law, wherein reference
to individual freedom will this all
end ?” . —

Legislators have admitted the
overwhelming opposition of . their
constituents to this law. Passage.
was due in large part to the efforts
of the New York State Society for
Medical Research—chartered in this
state ‘in1950. at the start of the
drive for,a’seizurefi law. . ' i

Regarding anesthesia, for instance,
the law states “* * * commensurate

the physiologic function under study,
all tests, experiments and investi-
gations involving pain», shall be per-
formed under adequate anesthesia.”
Thus the researcher alone is judge
of whether he shall'uSe'anesthetics.

 

 

' Use of .Strays _

Dr. Riker stresses the safety of
ipets—-th~at they are not desired by
vivisectors. Strays, often in pitiful
condition, ' hardly seem their best,
“material.” Obviously, healthytspeci-i
mens’ would be more-desirable.”

The defection of the American
Society for thePrevention of Cruelty
to Animals went a long way to‘
put. this law over. The A. S. P. C. At
was established as a humane Shel-V
ter. Funds. IcontributedA—in addi-
tion to approximately $1,000,000
annually in license. taxes—were
given for prevention of cruelty.

SOCIETY FOR ANIMAL PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION
745 Fifth Avenue

New York 22, New York
January 29, l96b

To Humanitarians in New York State:

Good humane slaughter bills have been introduced in the New York State legislature
by Senator Robert C. McEwen (S. 813) and Assemblyman Robert J. Feinberg (A. lb92).
These identical bills need and deserve your active support.

Please write to Albany urging support of these bills, and ask your friends to write,
too, to:

1) Your State Senators and Assemblyman (a call to your local paper or library
will give you their names).
Governor Nelson Rockefeller
Senator Walter J. Mahoney
Speaker Joseph F. Carlino

STATE CAPITOL
ALBANY, NEW YORK

All may be addressed at:

5) Your local editor asking him to publish an editorial for the bill.

This essential legislation has been too long delayed. Please emphasize that you
want ENACTMENT OF THE MCEWEN-FEINBERG HUMANE SLAUGHTER BILL IN THIS IEGISIATIVE SESSION.

Sincerely,
Madeleine Bemelmans, President

Christine Stevens, Secretary
Adele Schoepperle, Treasurer

4 THE DAILY TIMESI MAMARONECK, N.Y., MONDAY, JANUARY 20, 1964

EDITORIALS

 

Why Not Be Humane About It?

AMONG the bills perennially,
almost forlornly, pre-filed in A1-
bany is one requiring the use of
humane m e t h o d s for the
slaughter of meat animals. The
measure, sponsored by Sen.
Robert C. McEwen of Ogdens-
burg and Assemblyman Robert
J. Feinberg of Plattsburgh,
would extend protection to meat
animals not covered by federal
legislation enacted in 1958 and
applying only to plants selling
meat to the federal government.

The bill, in the form recom-

 

mended by the Council of State
Governments and supported by
numerous h u m a n e societies,
calls for the use of various me-
chanical, electrical and chemi-
cal methods for rendering ani-
mals insensible to pain before
shackling, hoisting, sticking or
bleeding.

THERE IS NO infringement
of religious freedom in the leg-
islation, which specifically deo
clares the traditional method of
ritual slaughter to be humane.

 

The arguments in favor of hu-
mane slaughter scarcely need
relaboring after all these years.
Similarly, the objections to hu-
mane slaughter legislation are
so ﬂimsy that they merit no
further consideration.

FIFTEEN states, at last
count, have seen fit to supple-
ment federal legislation in this
field. Surely the New York Leg-
islature should join their civil
ized company by passing the
McEwen-Feinberg bill.

An attempt has bean made by The Jewish Press and othara
to confuse the issue by calling the Calli~Paine bills “antiuschechita
bills". These statements, which have an basis in fact, have lad.t0
the failure for four years running of the legiﬁlation which is 80
ﬁasperately naeﬁad to pravent the great, needless suffering now being
endured by animals in ﬂew York State slaughterhougas.

Dear Friends:

I urge you to read very carefully the enclosed
letter from the chairman of your humane slaughter committee,
Arthur Amundsen.

As Mr. Amundsen tells you, he, Collis hbger,
Colonel Edward Rowan and I have made several trips to Albany
where we passed many weary hours tramping Capitol corridors
talking to senators and assemblymen, particularly to those
who are members of the committees considering our humane
slaughter bills.

‘ we have been told that the approval of Governor
Rockefeller, Senate Majority Leader walter J. Mahoney, and
Speaker of the Assembly Joseph C. Carlino is necessary to

'get action on our humane slaughter bills. We must now send

our letters to these three men urging them to direct that
our humane slaughter bills be reported out of committees.
Please do so at once and ask your friends to write them too.

I want to eXpress my personal thanks to all of you

‘who have written.letters, tehagraphed and phoned to your

assemblymen and senators. I am very grateful to Arthur
Amundsen, chairman of our Humane Slaughter Committee, to
Collis wager and Colonel Ed Rowan for their efforts in
Albany. And thanks to all of the Humane Societies that
requested their members to write to State legislators. I
know that the following Societies did so: Erie County
Humane Society of Buffalo, Animal Welfare Institute of New
York, Stevens-Swan Humane Society of Utica, Humane Society
of Rochester and Monroe County, Mohawk and Hudson Humane
Society of Albany, Humane Society of Port Jervis—Deerpark,
Humane Society of United States, and American Humane
Association. There may have been other societies I have
not heard of.

Members of the New York State Humane Association Humane
Slaughter Committee were again in.Albany on Monday and Tuesday,
March 18 and 19. he Spoke to the Assembly Codes Committee
and held several conferences with assemblymen and senators.

we came to the definite conclusion that it is most
imperative that members of the NeurYork State Humane Associa-
tion write immediately to Governor Nelson D. Rockefeller,
Senator Majority Leader Walter S. Mahoney, and Speaker of
the Assembly Joseph F. Carlino asking them to give approval
to the two companion humane slaughter bills Sponsored.by
the New York State Humane Association. These are Senator
Eustis Paine‘s bill before the Senate Agriculture Committee,
Print Number 3311, and Assemblyman William S. Calli‘s bill
now before the Assembly.Rules Committee, Print No. 3527.

We.must convince these three men that humane Slaughter
legislation is necessary to prevent the terrible suffering'
on the cattle killing floors of NewVYork State. ‘we must
start a continuing campaign nowD

Sincerely yours,

MACNEIL MITCHELL
201'." DISTRICT
CHAIRMAN

COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY OCtOb 81” , 1963

Dear Constituent:

As you may know, the New York State Legislature and
a number of the Executive Departments regularly issue
reports and brochures as an integral part of their service
to the public. These cover a variety of subjects in an
authoritative and interesting fashion, including the opera-
tion of state government, state programs and facilities at your
disposal, health matters, vacation and travel ideas and
many others. I thought you might enjoy having a few of these
booklets.

Enclosed is a list of publications which I have been
able to secure. If you will simply check those you wish
and return the form to my Albany office, I will be glad to
see that they are sent to you.

Since all of the booklets are in limited supply, it
will not be possible to send you more than one c0py of
each. It would be appreciated, too, if you would hold your
request to a reasonable number of separate titles.

Are there ever any state or community matters of
special interest or concern to you? If so, please feel
free to bring them to my attention at any time. It is
always a pleasure to cooperate with you and my other con—
stituents in every possible and apprOpriate manner.

Yours sincerely,

,7 2.. WI?

Dear Miss Stevens:

Supplementing our exchange of correspondence
I do want you to know that I have tried in every
possible way to lend a helping hand in support
of the Paine~bill relating to Humane Slaughter
of animals.

It is unfortunate that the members of the
Legislature do not seem to have been fully
apprised of your determination to unite solidly
behind the PaineHCalli measure. From all I can
gather,a great deal of support was still manin
fested for the Savarese legislationi At all
events I am aware of your feelings and will do
my best to help.

Meanwhile, as your Senatorial representaw
tive it is always a pleasure to hear from you
in connection with matters of community and
legislative importance. Please do not hesitate
to contact me whenever you feel I can be of
helpful cooperation.

Very sincerely,

7mm massaa

Dear Friend of Humane Slaughter:

Here is a copy of a letter by Mr. Myron Holtzman,
which went out to some 700 Reform rabbis in the United
States, urging their support in the current campaign to
do away with shackling and hoisting of live animals before
the shechita procedure. I am sure you will be interested

to know that already a number of letters of support have
been received.

One eminent rabbi, in enthusiastically endorsing our
position and wishing us success, wrote: "kindness to God's
creation is not only a mitzvah (blessing) and a virtue for
Jewish life but that all mankind is liable to the same
restrictions....The ’sons of Noah vaccording to Jewish

Talmudic authority, were forbidden to cut flesh from living
animals for their food."

YOu may find the substance of the letter helpful in
explaining the issue to your friends.

Sincerely yours,

gate WW

NEW YORK 36. N.Y.

MURRAY HILL 7-4525

March 29, l965

Dear Rabbi:

May i call on you for assistance on a sensitive issue which
is shortly to be brought to the public?

The issue is the needless cruelty to animals in the shackling
and hoisting of live animals, prior to their being slaughtered
(shechita) for kosher food purposes. New mechanical holding pens
have been devised which eliminate the barbaric aspect of the pre-
handling of the animals while allowing the shochet to kill the
animal quickly and painlessly in compliance with Orthodox Jewish
ritual slaughter requirements. The shackling and hoisting
operation is a packinghouse handling procedure, not a religious
procedure. On the contrary, the kindly treatment of animals is
directed throughout biblical, talmudic and post-biblical litera-
ture. Hence, the continued slaughtering of animals by brutal
methods is-a gross violation of Jewish tradition that cries out
for its immediate termination. State legislation calling for the
outlawing of shackling and hoisting and the introduction of the
new holding pens will be requested in New York next month. It
protects kosher slaughtering from legal interference.

Regrettably, some Orthodox_rabbis have been resisting this
change on the basis of religious infringements to mask economic
factors in the issue. The installation of the new equipment may
result in price increases of kosher meats by one or two cents per
pound. The rabbis fear this may work a hardship on some Orthodox
Jews and cause them to abandon their dietary Observances. I
believe these fears are groundless, and that any appreciable
movement away from Orthodoxy would be for some other deep-rooted
reasons.

Is it not significant that the State of Israel uses holding
pens similar to those pr0posed here, and does not permit the
shackling and hoisting of live animals in their own kosher slaught-
ering procedures? Moreover, Israel has consistently banned the
import of U. S. kosher meat processed by the shackling and
hoisting methods! The mechanical holding pens have been widely
endorsed by Orthodox rabbis and organizations, including the
eminent Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik of Boston, the Rabbinical
Council of America, and the Union of Orthodox Rabbis. The RCA,

 




 

- 2 -

in l963, formally deplored shackling and hoisting and urged all

U. S. rabbis to encourage use of the holding pens. Canada, Great
Britain and France have adOpted apprOpriate legislation and
holding devices and the procedures are working out smoothly with
the approval of Orthodox Jewry in those countries. In our coun-
try, slaughterers and packers in many states have installed the '
holding pens and have found them to be economically advantageous.

Puzzling indeed is the attitude of some individual Orthodox
rabbis who, while publicly hailing the new holding pens, are
determinedly resisting legislation in New York State to insure
the installation of these devices. These rabbis are now urging
the voluntary introduction of these pens by kosher slaughterers.
The sad fact is that in six years of appeals, persuasion and
education, not a single New York kosher slaughterer has installed
the restraining pens!

Many humane-minded Christians, who are presently forced to
eat the meat of animals cruelly handled before slaughter, because
of the marketing setup in New York State, are solidly behind the
change. The seeds of serious interfaith conflict are harbored
in the Opposition of a few Orthodox rabbis, whose Opposition
constitutes the sole barrier to the new mechanical methods, so
earnestly sought by a great many Jews and non-Jews.

As the situation stands today, a committee is being formed,
a UCommittee of Jews for Humane Koshér Slaughtering,“ to call the
public's attention to the problem through a full-page advertise-
ment in the New York Times, essentially similar to this letter.
May we list your name for this purpose? »

I hOpe you will respond favorably by return mail, indicating
your support of this issue, and granting us permission to list
you as a member of this committee.

Sincerely yours,

Myron Holtzman

Dear Mrs . Lewis:

I want to thank you sincerely for your interest and
encouragement concerning the bill which I sponsored in the State
Senate during the recent legislative session, to provide for the
humane slaughtering of livestock.

Your expression of approval was most heartening to me
at a time when every effort was being exerted to have this
measure enacted into law.

As you undoubtedly know, despite the tireless efforts
of many people, the bill was not reported from Committee and
therefore did not come to a vote 3 and although the final outcome
this year was a very great disappointment, I do feel that defi-
nite progress was made.

While no further legislative action is possible this
year, I can assure you that we do not intend to give up the
fight, and will continue to work toward correcting the misinfor-
mation and clearing up the misunderstanding on this subject
which still exist in some quarters. With continued effort, I
am confident that success can be realized in this vital and im-
portant field.

{thank you again for your encouraging support.

THE NATIONAL CATHOLIC SOCIETY FOR ANIMAL WELFARE

1346 CONNECTICUT AVENUE. N. w. 0 WASHINGTON. D. C. 20036

February 5, 1964
To New York State Residents:

The New York humane slaughter bill (S. 813 — A. 1492) is receiving a great
deal of support and we are hopeful that it may soon be brought out of committee.
Your continued letters and telegrams to your legislators are extremely important.

If you haven’t already done so, please write or wire the following, asking
them to support S.8l3—.A. 1492, the humane slaughter bill introduced by Senator
Robert C. McEwen and.Assemblyman Robert J. Feinberg:

1. Your New York State Senator. See the attached list for his name.

2. Your New York State Assemblyman. If in doubt about his name, call
the local Board of Elections, a political organization or newspaper.

3. The Hon. Julius Volker, Chairman of the Assembly Codes Committee.

a. The Hon. Walter Van Wiggeren, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee.

All of the above can be addressed at the Capitol, Albany. Even if you
have written cnce, please write again. The session is expected to adjourn
in March, so there is no time to spare in having the bill brought out of
committee and to a vote in both houses.

A bill that would amend the New York State anti-cruelty law to exempt in~
stitutions of the university of the state of New York should be opposed. It
is Senate Bill Print 1202, introduced by Senator Metcalf. It would add to
the section of the penal code which prohibits cruelty to animals the follow—
ing exemption: ”Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prohibit or
interfereiwith any scientific experiments or investigations in any accredited
or degree granting institution of the university of the state of New York.”

Please Oppose it by writing your New York State Senator and Assemblyman
and to the Chairman of the Senate Codes Committee. Letters separate from
your message about the humane slaughter bill would be advisable to prevent
confusion about the two bills.

Your letters and telegrams are making a most favorable impression in
Albany. Please keep up the good work so that animals may have protection
from the terrible suffering they are undergoing in slaughterhouses.

Sincerely yours,

Helen E. Jones

SOCIETY FOR ANIMAL PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION
745 Fifth Avonuo
New York 22. New York

March 19, 1962
To Humanitarians in New York State:

Both the Calli and Marano humane Slaughter bills in the New York State Assembly
have been killed by failure of the Codes Committee to report them out in that Committee's
final report for the year. I

The Conklin humane slaughter bill is still alive. It is pending before the Senate
Agriculture Committee .

Opponents of humane slaughter legislation have given erroneous information to
many legislators which has led them to believe that there is a religious issue involvedr,
THERE IS NO RELIGIOUS ISSUE . The Conklin humane slaughter bill protects religious
ritual specifically. What it would abolish is the Shackling and hoisting of conscious
animals as shown in the enclosed sheet. This Shackling and hoisting is not a religious
requirement. Shackling and hoisting is a mass-production slaughterhouse-technique
unknown in the days when the rules of Orthodox Jewish ritual killing were laid down.

In federally inspected plants operating under the Federal Humane Slaughter Act,
it is illegal to shackle and hoist any conscious animal unless such animal is to be
kosher killed. In New York State Kosher killing is the rule for the majority of cattle,
calves, sheep and lambs slaughtered. It is essential that New York enact legislation
requiring humane pre-slaughter handling of ritually slaughtered animals.

Only through greatly increased public demand can the Conklin humane slaughter
bill receive favorable action. The chances of its passage are small. The need for its
passage is great. The two men who can bring the humane slaughter bill to a vote are:

Senator Walter J. Mahoney, Majority Leader

and
Senator Walter Van Wiggeren, Chairman, Senate Agriculture Committee

Members of the Senate Agriculture Committee are:

Senator George H. Pierce Senator Albert Berkowitz
Senator Austin W. Erwin Senator Janet Hill Gordon
Senator Ernest I. Hatfield Senator George Eustis Paine
Senator Henry A. Wise Senator Owen M. Begley
Senator E. Ogden Bush Senator Jack E. Bronston
Senator John H . Cooke Senator Frank J . Glinski
Senator Earl W. Bry‘dges Senator Ivan Warner
Senator Robert C. McEwen

All may be addressed: STATE CAPITOL, ALBANY, N. Y .

If you have not yet written to your own State Senator telling him of the urgent need
for this bill, please do so now. Extra copies of this letter and enclosure are available
on request. Please help get the facts to the legislators.

Sincerely,

Madeleine Bemelmans, President
Christine Stevens, Secretary-Treasurer

Z - Foreign Agent
' iomsm a”

“Unregistered

in the United States?

...Next came another crisis in the
form of a request from the Depart-
ment of Justice that the American
Zionist Council register as a
foreign agency, because it acts on
behalf of Israel and gets a good
part of its income from lsraeli
sources. This has caused a split
in the Council and considerable
anguish. The A.Z.C.’s counsel has
recommended that it register,
explaining that registration carries
no onus and pointing out that the
Jewish Agency is thus registered.

This reasoning, however, has not
been good enough for a majority

of the Council, who argue that
registration “would be worth a
hundred thousand dollars to the
American Council for Judaism,”
which has been maintaining that
Zionists are not good Americans.

...No one really wants this. not

only because it is the function of
the local Zionists to administer
strictly American tasks but also
because the United Jewish Appeal
cannot afford to engage in another
wrangle with the Revenue Bureau
about its tax exemption status if
some of its moneys again are ear-
marked for domestic purposes.

THE
JEWISH
CHRONICLE

NO COMMENT NEEDED! The Jewish Agency for Israel (administrative
arm of the World Zionist Organization) is divided over where to hold‘
its forthcoming, policy-forming Zionist Actions Committee meeting.
Usually, it takes place in Jerusalem. Some months ago, the Israelis
decided to hold the next meeting at the New York section of the Agency.
However, U. S. Zionists demurred. The Yiddish daily, Morning-Journal,
gives the reason: “The Israeli press called the child by its real name,
saying that ‘it seems that the American leaders are afraid lest at the
New York meeting of the Actions Committee the discussion would turn
on Aliyah (immigration) from America. ..’ "

 




ZIONISTS SABOTAGED RESCUE OF JEWS—says Michael Astour, teacher
of Yiddish language and literature at Brandeis University. He writes in the
current Freeland magazine published by the Freeland League for Jewish
Territorial Colonization. Mr. Astour reviews Ben Hecht’s ”Perfidy,” which
accused'Zionist leaders of helping to send Jews to their annihilation in Nazi
concentration camps rather than “lose their political goal of a Jewish home—
land in Palestine." Mr. Astour says he ”did not need Hecht's book to learn of
the fatal role which Zionist leaders played in the 30's and 40's." Astour
explains that the Freeland League “frequently wrote.. .about Zionism's
great responsibility for the incredible passivity of the organized Jewish com-
munity during those fateful years when Hitlerism and anti-Semitism engulfed
one European country after another and destroyed the lives of millions of
Jews . . . But instead of doing everything possible to rescue Jews, they utilized
their entire financial and behind-the-scenes connection, to sabotage all other
efforts to get Jews out of Europe. Their haven must be Palestine—and only
Palestine." Mr. Astour cites efforts to rescue Jews and settle them in England,
Australia, in the French colonies and in the United States, but, he says,
Zionists ”undermined the plans which would have provided an immediate
sanctuary for tens of thousands of Jews and a possibility to rescue hundreds
of thousands of Jews from the Hitler hell.” In I938, says Astour, “President
Roosevelt called an international conference of government representatives
. . . to explore practical means of alleviating the Jewish refugee and migra-
tion problem. Emissaries from all Zionist Jewish parties hurried there—not to
obtain aid for the unfortunate refugees, but to prevent adOption of any
constructive program which might lessen the position of Palestine as the only
possible haven of immigration for Jews." This further substantiates the
detailed charges made by the noted civil liberties attorney, Morris Ernst, in

Q) Council News, May, I950.

 

MENORAH JOURNAL MEMORIAL ISSUE In I961, death took Henry Hur-
witz, editor of The Menorah Journal for nearly 50 years. Though not a Coun-
cil member, Mr. Hurwitz intellectually stimulated many Council members who
valued his abundant knowledge and independent reformulation of ideas and
issues in Judaism. The Board of Governors of The Menorah Association has
published a memorial issue of The Menorah Journal as a final tribute to the
late editor and the magazine that suspended with his death. The memorial
issue is edited by Dr. Leo W. Schwarz, author, anthologist and long-time
friend of Henry Hurwitz. It includes editorial material and art which Mr.
Hurwitz had planned for a future issue of The Menorah Journal. Also included
are an appreciation of Menorah by Horace M. Kallen and articles by Harry
Wolfson, Marvin Lowenthal, William F. Albright and others; a tender memoir
of his late wife by Henry Hurwitz; poetry, reviews and commentary. The
publishers believe that with its richness in content, beauty of style and dignlIY
of format, the memorial issue is closer to a distinguished book of enduring
value than to a conventional magazine. Cost of the paper-bound edition is
$5.00. A limited cloth-bound edition is available to contributors of $25.00
or more. (All checks to Menorah are tax-deductible.) The issue may be
obtained from The Menorah Association, I30 East 59th Street, New York
22, N. Y.

 

 




 

ISRAEL AND U. S. INTERESTS DIFFER The Israeli nationality case of
Brother Daniel and Israel’s handling of the Soblen case prompted Carl
Alpert to ask in the weekly, Jewish Post and Opinion, “What happens
when an act by Israel is not approved by Jews elsewhere?” He an-
swered, “American Jews must realize that Israel’s actions and policies
are based on its own laws and on the conscience of the government
and people of Israel. Israel cannot and must not pause before each act
to consider, what will the Jews of the world think of this?" This declara-

tion of independence could be heartily applauded by anti-Zionists if

Israel and the Zionist movement would cease claiming to be the

“sovereign authority for world Jewry” and halt appeals for political
support of American Jews on the basis of claimed special obligations
to Israel.

BALFOUR DECLARATION DELUSIONS “Congress, the American people

and Presidents of the United States (except Roosevelt) were duped into sup-

porting the Balfour Declaration, without realizing the consequences of such sup-

port," says Norman Howard, author of ”The Balfour Declaration In American
l Foreign Policy,” in the Middle-East Forum. He quotes Winston Churchill in the

House of Commons in 1937: ”It is a delusion to suppose this (the Balfour
l Declaration) was a mere act of crusading enthusiasm or quixotic philanthropy.
On the contrary, it was a measure taken . . . in due need of the war with the
obiect of promoting the general victory of the Allies, for which we accepted
and received valuable and important assistance." The article cited the so«
called ”safeguard clause" of the Balfour Declaration which declared, “it being
clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may preiudice the...
rights and political status enioyed by Jews in any other country." This guaran-
tee, the article notes, “the Zionists chose to disregard . . .” Referring to the
continuing Arab-lsrael problem, the article concluded, ”The United States is
not winning any new friends in the Middle East and it cannot begin to do so
again until it somehow erases those tremendously complicated problems
created by the Balfour Declaration, which it unwisely endorsed almost from
the very beginning."

A'CJ SPEAKER AT OR'I' A New York chapter of the Organization for
Rehabilitation Through Training (ORT) heard Irwin Herrman, ACJ re-
search director, discuss the legal implications of Zionist usage of the
term, “the Jewish people.” The phrase is an essential to Zionism, he
explained, as are the first ten amendments to the U. S. Constitution. The
phrase, Mr. Herrman said, denotes a political-legal entity which has
rights in and owes obligations to Israel. All Jews, he told ORT members,
are part of that political-national collectivity, all “without regard to the
individual preference of any member.” An ORT spokesman said that the
address was “well received,” and that it brought new insights to mem-
bers who had heard only Zionist interpretations of issues and events.

NEW SANHEDRIN ADVOCATED The re-establishment of a Sanhedrin
(supreme religious law-making and enforcing body) was urged by Rabbi
Shlomo Goren, chief spiritual leader of Israel’s armed forces, according to the
New York Times. The last Sanhedrin, in Jerusalem, was ended by the Romans
in the year 70. Rabbi Goren, at a press conference, said that the modern
Sanhedrin would be located in Israel. It would ”ﬁll the vacuum in world
Jewish life,” he said, ”because of the present lack of an effective rabbinic
authority which could issue binding orders and rulings on difficult religious
matters.” The Religious Zionists of America staged the special press confer-
ence. Rabbi Goren tied Israel to the destiny of all Jews and urged a “more
solid association and bond.” He was in the U.S. ”on behalf of the Israel bond
campaign.” . . .Also related to church-state ties, an Institute of Jewish Law
was launched January 7 by the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. According
to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, “The institute will serve interested bodies,
such as the Justice Ministry’s legislative department, with the aim of basing
lsraeli parliamentary legislation on the principles of Jewish law."

FEDERAL AID TO JEWISH SCHOOLS? A strong segment of Jewish Orthodox
leadership may appeal “for Federal aid if Jewish communities do not volun-
tarily support the Jewish day schools,” reported the New York Times. At
present 54,000 children attend 275 Jewish day schools, the maiority of them
under Orthodox auspices. This pressure for support echoes resolutions passed
by the Zionist Organization of America, which called for ”the establishment of
new Jewish Day schools" and for exercising inﬂuence ”on local Federation
and Welfare Funds to financially support such schools.” All-day Jewish
schools formerly declined as recently arrived immigrants became integrated
into American life. Now such schools are vigorously promoted by Zionists for
nationalistic aims. Moshe Sharett, former Israeli Premier, told the World Zionists
Congress last year, “In each city the Zionists should initiate the founding of
Day Schools in which a Jewish child would receive a full national education
in a Jewish-national atmosphere throughout the day” (emphasis added). The
purposes: ”Hebraization of the Diaspora"; to ”capture unorganized Jewish
@ youth” and to ”make aliya attractive and appealing . . ."

BRITISH VIEW OF ISRAEL —— The relationship of Israel with ]ews in

the rest of the world needs ”constant review and clearer understanding,”
said R. N. Carvalho, president of the Anglo-]ewish Association, at a recent
meeting of the British group. ”No matter what the lines of sympathy
between us and Israel,” he stated, ”there is a deﬁnite demarcation between
the loyalty to our national States and the interest we have in the State of
Israel. Certainly Israelis and the Israel Government would resist any eﬂort
by fews elsewhere to attempt to speak on their behalf or to interfere in local
political matters. Similarly, we have to be vigilant that our fellow citizens
and our Government do not confuse our special relationships with Israel
and the allegiance of Iewish communities in the diﬂerent countries to those
countries.”

HOW ZIONISTS USED SYNAGOGUES Zionists discovered early
in the nineteen twenties that “the one place where we can get the Jew to
join our forces is the place where he prays for the redemption of Zion and
the liberation of our people.” The Zionist publication, New Palestine,
reported in 1924: “We made this discovery after we had tried to enlist by
mass meetings, by club affairs, after we had been looking for them in
every possible place, but the one place where we did ﬁnd them—in the
Synagogue.” The magazine noted that this approach to recruiting Zionists
from the synagogues had been most successful, and it hoped within a
short time Zionists would become the “leading personalities of the syna-
gogue and in that way the synagogue will become the center of Zionist
activities. . . .” This observation is reprinted in the Council’s current news-
letter, Education in Judaism, to show how Zionists—then and now—seek
to take over the synagogue, and Judaism, for political and national pur-
poses. Other items in the newsletter include a favorable comment of. the
new Bible translation by the Jewish Publication Society and a book rev1ew.

ACJ ROLE IN ANIMAL HUMANE SLAUGHTER CITED Pet Editor Virginia
Sheward of Newsday, daily newspaper on Long Island, N. Y., lauded the
Council as the national Jewish organization supporting the fight for humane
slaughter of animals. She called for a ”concerted fight” in New York State
“for a humane slaughtering law, to put an end to the unbelievably barbaric
cruelty inflicted on food animals in slaughter houses throughout the state."
New York, Miss Sheward said, is one of the few states which has not adopted
such a law. She deplored the fact that each year proposed legislation ”is
defeated by private lobbies." She refrained from identifying these ”private
lobbies” as a handful of ”Jewish leaders” with vested interests who give the
impression of representing 2,500,000 Jews. The Council, after studying the
recently proposed New York bills, was convinced that they provided protec-
tion for shechita, the ritual method of slaughter required by some denomina-

tions in Judaism. We supported the aims of the legislation on moral and

religious grounds.

COUNCIL ON FIVE-HOUR RADIO TALKATHON Leonard R.

Sussman, AC I executive director, and Bill Gottlieb, publicity director, were
the guests from midnight to ﬁve in the morning of Long john Nebel, com-
mentator on New York’s radio station WOR. Domestic and overseas issues
related to Zionism were raised by a trio of panelists, including Rabbi
Samuel Silver, a Zionist. This lively and provocative program produced a
large number of pro-Council responses by telegram, phone and mail, despite
the early morning hour.

MAY 1 -4, 1963 Members and friends are urged to reserve these
dates to attend our 20th Anniversary Conference at the Savoy-Hilton Hotel
in New York. Internationally known Americans will be among the speakers.
This will be one of the most important and memorable weeks in the history
of the Council. Reserve the dates now.

§ 96-aa. Declaration of legislative determination and poliey. The

legislature hereby ﬁnds and determines that the use of humane
methods in the slaughter of livestock prevents needless suﬂering,
results in safer and better working conditions for persons engaged
in the slaughtering industry, brings about improvement of products
and economy in slaughtering operations, and produces other beneﬁts
which tend to increase the orderly ﬂow of livestock and its products.
The legislature further ﬁnds and determines that suﬁieient, prac-
tical and economical methods for the humane slaughtering of live-
stock are available for compliance with the provisions of this article.
It is, therefore, declared to be the policy of the state of New York
that the slaughtering of livestock shall be carried out by humane
methods.

§' 96-bb. Deﬁnitions. As used in this article:

a. The term “person” means any individual, partnership, cor-
poration or association.

b. The term “livestock” means cattle, horses, swine, sheep, goats,
and any other animal which can or may be used in and for the
preparation of meat or meat products.

c. The term “slaughterer” means any person operating any
place or establishment where livestock is slaughtered or butchered
for food.

d. The term “commissioner” means the commissioner of agricul-
ture and markets.

e. The term “humane method” means:

1. That animals be rendered insensible to pain, by such manner
or means as the commissioner shall prescribe before being shackled.

requirements of the Jewish faith or any other religious faith that
prescribes a method of slaughter, be slaughtered by being rendered
unconscious by anemia of the brain caused by the simultaneous
and instantaneous severance of the carotid arteries with a sharp
instrument.

§ 96-cc. Purchases by state government. No department, agency
er instrumentality of the state of New York shall contract for or
procure any livestock products produced or processed from live-
stock slaughtered other than by a humane method.

§ 96-dd. Commissioner to make rules and regulations. The com-
missioner is hereby authorized and directed to promulgate such
rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry the provisions
of this article into eject.

§ 96-ee. Application of article. The provisions of this article
shall be applicable throughout the state but shall not apply to any

bona ﬁde farmer who slaughters or butchers his own domestic

animals. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prohibit,

abridge or in any way hinder the religious freedom of any person
or group. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, in
order to protect freedom of religion, ritual slaughter and the
handling or other preparation of livestock for ritual slaughter, are '
hereby exempted from the terms of this article. For the purposes
of this section, the term “ritual slaughter” means slaughter in
accordance with section ninety-sia-bb, subdivision e, paragraph two.

Dear Friends:

I urge you to read.very carefully the enclosed
letter from the chairman of your humane slaughter committee,
Arthur Amundsen.

As Mr. Amundsen tells you, he, Collis wager,
Colonel Edward Rowan and I have made several trips to Albany
where we passed many weary hours tramping Capitol corridors
talking to senators and assemblymen, particularly to those
who are members of the committees considering our humane
slaughter bills.

we have been told that the approval of Governor
Rockefeller, Senate Majority Leader Halter J. Mahoney, and
Speaker of the Assembly Joseph C. Carlino is necessary to

‘get action on our humane slaughter bills. Mb must now send

our letters to these three men urging them to direct that
our humane slaughter bills be reported out of committees.
Please do so at once and ask your friends to write them too.

I want to express my personal thanks to all of you

'who have written.letters, tehagraphed and phoned to your

assemblymen and senators. I am very grateful to Arthur
Amundsen, chairman of our Humane Slaughter Committee, to
Collis hbger and Colonel Ed Rowan for their efforts in
Albany. And thanks to all.of the Humane Societies that
requested.their members to write to State legislators. I
know that the following Societies did so: Erie County
Humane Society of Buffalo, Animal welfare Institute of New
York, Stevens-Swan Humane Society of Utica, Humane Society
of Rochester and Monroe County, Mohawk and Hudson Humane
Society of Albany, Humane Society of Port Jervis—Deerpark,
Humane Society of United States, and American Humane

New York City

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Your letter of February 23rd.has been received and
I hasten to say that again I am keenly anxious to support
and vote for humane slaughter legislation. I believe that
this type of a measure is exceedingly meritorious, and
have always adopted a positive policy with regard to bills
of this nature.

This year once again three separate bills have been
introduced; one by Senator Paine, another by Assemblyman
Calli and still another by Assemblyman Savarese dealing
with this subject. Copies of these are enclosed for your
perusal. As I have stated repeatedly, the ideal method of
obtaining legislative approval for this type of statute is
for all the proponents to unite behind one measure. Un-
fortunately, this is not What is being done this year and
it may have some adverse effect on the final action. Please
understand, however, that if any one of these measures
reaches the floor I will certainly cast my vote in the
affirmative. I am not on the Committee to which the bills'
have been referred so I cannot be helpful there.

It is always pleasant to hear from you on legis-
lative and community matters. Please do not hesitate to
let me hear from.you when you feel I might be of helpful
cooperation.

very sincerely,

To the Members of the New York State Humane Association »

Dear Fri ends:

Please read Arthur Aimindsen's letter very carefully. Success
this year in securing passage of humane slaughter legislation will
now depend upon the pressure you bring to bear upon your representa-
tives in Albany.

Both Mr. Amundsen and I visited the Capitol and’talked to
legislators about humane slaughter. We have had numerous phone
conversations with them also. We believe we are fortunate in
having Senator G. Eustis Paine and Assemblyman William S. Calli
introduce our humane slaughter bills. Both men have assured us
that they are very anxious to see their bills passed.

If each Humane Society will appoint a liason officer to whom we
can mail material about humane slaughter legislation for distribution,
it would be most helpful. Please send me at once the name and
address of the person who will represent your Society.

I have enclosed a copy of a suggested standard for The Use Of
Live Animals in High School Biology Classes. We have given them to
superintendents, principals and heads of science departments in all
high schools in Monroe County. They have been very satisfactorily
received. If you want some to send to schools, please write me and
say how many you wish.

I telegraphed the following to the Program Manager of the
National Broadcasting Company in New York City:

"As president of the New York State Humane Association
and Member of the Board of Directors of the American
Humane Association, I strongly protest the NBC TV
Special Sports International Saturday afternoon depict-
ing a bull fight. We endeavor to inculcate in children
a reverence for life and to develOp attitudes Of kind-
ness. Labelling 90 minutes of bull fighting a sport
and showing it to children can destroy many years of
effort to teach kindness. On behalf of all humane
thinkers in New York State, I ask you to cancel the
program on bull fighting. "

Again, please write your Senator and Assemblyman at once.

Sincerely yours,

animals in classroom eXperiments that involve pain, long suffering,
and cruelty,

A high school biology class is not a State approved laboratory or
institution established for the purpose of experimenting with living
animals,

Within the last few months, a New York State humane society in
two public schools forced the end of live animal experiments in the
transplanting of cancerous tissue from cancer suffering animals to
healthy ones.

Administrators of a prominent medical school in New York State
have said emphatically they are Opposed to such experiments being
carried out in any but approved medical laboratories.

The New York State Humane Association recognizes that frequently
animals should be kept in biology classrooms so that pupils may be
taught correct methods of observation about animal behavior, heredity
and learning power, It believes that any animals used for such
purposes should be so treated that their health and wellubeing be of
first consideration while they are in the classrooms.

When the biology teacher uses animals as teaching aids, the New
York State Humane Association requests that these recommendations be
followed:

1. Animals being observed by students must always be
maintained in the maximum possible condition of health,
comfort and well-being.)

 




No vertebrate animal used for secondary school teaching
may be subjected to any experiment or procedure which
interferes with its normal health or causes it pain or
distress.

Handle the animals gently.

Provide preper feeding, fresh clean water, and suit-
able sanitary shelter.

If animals are kept in classrooms over week-ends or
holidays, a qualified caretaker should see to care and
feeding.

Live animals should.never be destroyed in the presence
of students.

No experiments should be made that involve:

a. The administering of disease germs or poison
b. Cancer research . . '

0. Excessive excercise or restraint

d. The use of anesthetic drugs

The New York State Humane Association has a moral and legal reSponsitility to
protect all animals from unnecessary suffering. If the need arises, it will offer the
same protection to animals used in high school classrooms for experimental purposes.

The New York State Humane Association hopes for the c00peration of all State
high school science teachers, and that they will endeavor to direct their teaching

so that their young students will develOp the attitude of kindness to all living
creatures.

llHS Nineteenth Street, N. w.
Washington 6, D. C.

 

 

 

 

February 21, 1963
TO ALL HUMANB SOCIETIES AND HUMANITARIANS OF NEW YORK STATE:

Excellent humane slaughter bills have been introduced in the New York
legislature by Assemblyman William S. Calli and Senator George Eustis Paine.
The two bills are identical, and both are in the form recommended by the
Council of State Governments.

The Assembly bill is identified as "Introduction No. 3457." The Senate
bill is "Introduction No. 3106."

Since the New York legislature will probably adjourn by mid-March, time
is short indeed and yOUI‘ immediate and Vigorous support is urgently needed. En...
actment of this legislation will save tens of thousands of animals from torture
every year. New York humanitarians can, by action NOW push it through the
legislature. '~**

We suggest and urge these immediate actions:
1. Every humane society should move at once to send out an emergency

bulletin to all of its members and supporters, asking them to take
the steps outlined below. '

 

Every individual humanitarian should -

 

A. Write a letter to his own State Senator, urging support of
"the Paine humane slaughter bill (Intro 3106)";

B. Send a similar letter to his own Assemblyman, urging support
of "the Calli humane slaughter bill (Intro 3457)";

C. Persuade several friends and relatives to write similar letters.

If you do not know the name of your own State Senator or Assemblyman, you
can obtain it from your local newspaper, library, courthouse, or city hall. All
Senators and Assemblymen can be addressed at ”The Capitol, Albany, New York."

Please act AT ONCE. Whether or not animals can be saved from slaughter~house
cruelties depends entirely upon what legislators hear from the public.

Thank you for your letter of June 1 in connection with humans
slaughter.

'Michigan was the fourteenth state to join.the ranks of whose
requiring humane slaughter. Maryland was the thirteenth. Several
states goined the ranks this past year. The Humane Slaughter Law,
'under which the federal government operates, was passed in 1958.

I will be happy to furnish any advice and assistance which I
can in this matter. I will be happy to see you at any time to dis—
cuss humane slaughter. Since my schedule of inspecticnal trips is
ratier heavy for the months of June, July and August, I would suggest
that you.call me at GR 4—2498 if you are planning to come to Albany,
so that I will be in the office when you arrive. I do not have any
trips scheduled into New Yerk City at the moment, but should the
occasion arise to visit the city, I will contact you to arrange for a
conference.

YOur interest in the meat inspection program and in humane slaugh-
ter is sincerely appreciated.

New York State Humane Slaughter Bill Introduced

.A bill for humane slaughter of meat animals was introduced today in
the New York State Senate by Senator George Eustis Paine. A companion
bill, introduced by Assemblyman William S. Calli, is pending in the As-
sembly.

The bill can be enacted into law this session if it receives strong
and sustained support from humanitarians throughout the state.

Write or wire your New York State Senator and Assemblyman at Albany,
telling them.you strongly support Senator Paine's bill for the humane
slaughter of meat animals (Intro. No. 3106) and Assemblyman Calli's
companion bill (Intro No. 3&57). The bill numbers and sponsors' names
will clearly identify the bills.

It is extremely important that letters and telegrams of support
be sent immediately. The New York legislative session is brief and the
humane slaughter bill must be passed this session.

If you.do not know the name of your Senator or Assemblyman, call.the
local Board of Elections, a political club or newspaper. Telephone numbers
for the Board of Elections in the New York metrOpolitan area are:

Manhattan (New York County) CAnal 6-2600

Brooklyn (Kings County) TRiangle 5-7100

Queens BOulevard 8-5000 Or
BO 3-3220

Bronx CYpress 9-9017

Staten Island (Richmond County) SAint George 7-1955

Legislators must be swamped with mail urging passage of the bill if
it is to be enacted to protect animals from.the appalling suffering caused
by cruel slaughter methods.

Write now, ask others to write, and keep writing!

THE PATIONAL CATHOLIC SOCIETY FOR ANIMAL WELFARE
733 Fifteenth Street, N. W.
Washington 5, D. C.

March 15, 1962
To New York State Humanitarians:

Jewish opponents are increasingly active in their attempts to defeat the
Conklin-Marano humane slaughter bill even though the measure specifically de—
fines the Jewish slaughter ritual as a humane method, preventing any inter-
ference with it.

A Brooklyn newspaper entitled The Jewish Press recently urged its read—
ers to fill in and mail to legislators coupons opposing humane slaughter leg-
islation and saying in part: “Our religious rights cannot be tampered with."
As a result, legislators were swamped with coupons and-letters sent by people
who have not read the bill and are unaware that it in no way threatens or
interferes with the Jewish slaughter ritual. Many of the letters were from
children, some saying they did not want to be denied the right to eat meat,
indicating how badly they were misinformed about the bill.

The opposition is certainly not representative of the Jewish faith, many
of whose members are among the most dedicated workers for humane slaughter leg-
islation. Nevertheless, the opponents claim to speak for all Jews and are doing
their best to convince legislators, through letters, phone calls, telegrams and
visits to Albany, that there is a religious issue in the bill. In seeking to
defeat the bill entirely or, as an alternative, to win protection for shackling
and hoisting, they put themselves in the position of defending an exceedingly
cruel handling method (shackling and hoisting) which Orthodox Rabbis have ad:
mitted is not a part of the Jewish ritual.~ "3

While opponents cry 'religious freedomr in Opposing the bill, leading
the uninformed to think that there is some religious issue in it, they make no
mention of the tremendous overproduction of kosher meat, much of which is sold,
unlabeled as such, to non—Jews. Strangely enough, New-York State has a strict-
ly enforced law requiring the labeling of koSher meat sold to kosher consumers
in order to assure them they actually are purchasing meat produced through the
ritual method. No such law exists to-require the identification of kosher
meat purchased by non~Jews unaware that they are buying a product of the
ritual of others.

In addition to overproduced kosher meat, the hind quarters of kosher
slaughtered animals, forbidden as meat for Orthodox Jews because the meat is
heavily veined, are sold unidentified as kosher produced, to non—Jews. When
the carcasses of kosher slaughtered animals exhibit certain imperfections
that render the meat trefah (meaning forbidden) for Jews, that meat also is
sold, unidentified as having been produced through the ritual method, to non-
Jews. .A very scholarly book written by a Rabbilon Shehitah, the ritual method,
pointed out that kosher meat would be very costly to kosher consumers if it
were not for the side traffic in the sale of kosher meat to non—Jews.

pointed out that kosher meat would be very costly to kosher consumers if it
were not for the side traffic in the sale of kosher meat to non~Jews.

 




If the Opponents are successful in killing the humane slaughter bill again
this year, humanitarians might wish to consider the need for a law requiring
the identification of all_kosher produced meat so that those not wishing to
purchase it may have the same freedom of choice that is now restricted to those
desiring kosher produced meat.

The need, however, is for enactment of the Conklin-Marano bill in this ses~
sion of the New York State Legislature. The session is rapidly approaching
adjournment.

Again we implore all who have not written or wired the following, urging
them to support the Conklin~Marano bill, to do so at once:

Governor Nelson Rockefeller

Senator Walter J. Mahoney, Majority Leader

Senator Walter Van Wiggeren, Chairman,
Senate Agriculture Committee

Speaker of the Assembly Joseph F. Carlino

Your own Senator

Your own Assemblyman

All of the above can be addressed at The Capitol, Albany, New York. In
addition to letters, telephone your Senator and.Assemblyman. Most can be
reached at their offices or homes late in the week or during the week-end.

If you have written before, write again. The Opponents are untiring in
their efforts. We have to be willing to put forth as much effort, and more,
if we expect to bring about enactment of the humane slaughter bill this year.

Sincerely yours,

Helen E. Jones
Executive Director

Dear ars.Bemelmans:

I haven't heard yet what happened to the Conhlin
slaughter bill, but our local paper,the Argus, supported it. I’m
enclosing a clipping you probably have seen, published in response
to a favorable editorial,hy the "opposition."

Whatever happened in Albany, l'm sure time is
of utmost importance, and the deliberate stalling of getting not only
this bill but others on the same order, passed, reminds me of the
giant stalling tactics used in the U.N.when Russia stopped boycotting
it after the Korean ear started, and then held up all chances of
stopping the slaughter in Korea, for their own devious purposes.
runny (odd) how a group will stall at tne very 'ime you'd think
people want more than anything else to stop something inhumani

4 As for the Rabbi’s letter in the Argus ~ it
sounds as though all Jews are EDT in favor of it, and of course, it's
all too technical for me to understand. however, wouldn't it be
Quicker, if more arguments are necessary in the future, to go
right to the source, than to generalize about their attitude?
If there is adequate legah protection in other states, then what
of Jews there? Can't some of these be quoted? And if the Jewish
ritual demands inhumane slaughtering, (which i doubt) shouldn't the
Jews themselves get behind a reform? I can't think of any group
of people on earth who have as much reason as do the Jews to
try to stamp out inhumane treatment of any living thing. Ana if the
Jewish leaders (especially in other states) agree the slaughter blilS
are NOT against them, shouldn’t someone fine out WHO'S actually trying
togm1q>ﬁmrmﬁw,amiﬂm?

i wrote several letters,as usual, aoout the Uonklin
bill, and l WlSh l could do far more for every day’s eehay means more
suffering, and, to me, brings just that much more shame upon a nation
of suogosedly civilized peeple. i Know you're very busy, and so l will
not expect an answer to this letter. however, i still want to help,
ans if i can think of any way to so so, I shall.

Sincerely,

as ea”

P.S.

The Rabbi refers to the bill "as it is presently formulated.“ i assume
this means Rabbis are helping to formulate each new version m and if they
are,they should be ousted that way. if not — why not??

DEAR COUNCIL MEMBER:

‘Will you help in the 1963 New York State Humane Slaughter Campaign?

No bill has been introduced yet this year. ‘we suspect that Majority Leader
SenatorVWalter J. Mahoney, from your district, holds the key to its passage.
Last year he seemed sympathetic to such legislation until he got opinions
from Jewish friends. Soon after, the proposed legislation died.

May I ask if you would write a personal letter to Senator Mahoney, at the
Marine Trust Building, Buffalo 3, New York, urging his support for proposed
humane slaughter legislation?

CHICAGO 2, ILL.— 10 N. CLARK ST.

In this letter you might make any'of the following points: that the cruel
treatment in the present shackling and hoisting of live animals for kosher
Slaughtering is intolerable; that new holding pens, eliminating this pa

of the slaughtering, have been in operation in meat packing plants around
the country and are working out well for all concerned -~ the animals, the
packers, the shochets (who perform the Jewish ritual slaughter) and the
Orthodox rabbis; that you are familiar with Jewish traditions of kosher
slaughtering and there is no violation of any laws resulting from installa-
tion of the new devices; that,_in fact, the present method is in direct
contradiction to Biblical injunctions, all of which call for kind treatment
to animals; that if there is any opposition, it must stem from economic
considerations rather than religious sensitivities. This refers to the
initial cost of installing new holding devices.

In writing to Senator mahoney, please use your own personal style and
phraseology; I believe that the Senator would respond favorably to appeals
from constituents in his own district. A copy of your letter to the
Senator would be appreciated.

Humane Slaughter at Last?

In 1958, long after many other nations had
acted similarly, the United States outlawed
cruelty in the slaughter of meat animals by pack- .
iers selling to the Federal Government. But this
law falls far short of dealing with the problem‘
nation-wide.

A dozen states have passed humane slaughter
laws. New York is not among them. For three
years the Legislature has failed to act. Now,
with a bill introduced by Senator William 'T.
Conklin of Brooklyn, it has a'new opportunity
to show the mercy to prevent needless suffering
on the part of food animals, and to make less
degrading the work of men in slaughterhouses.

The bill, in a form recommended. by the Council
of State Governments as model uniform legisla-
tion, Would require that as a preliminary an
animal be made insensible to pain by mechanical,
chemical, electrical or other means “that are
rapid and effective.” The point would be to
spare the animals the barbarities and uncer-
tainties of the present method, a description of
which we will also spare our readers. The re-
form has other, even monetary, advantages. But
the abomination of unnecessary cruelty to ani-
mals, and the effect on man of permitting it, is
such compelling reason for passing this bill that
others don’t matter.

Let’s not wait one more year for correction of
the nauseating practices followed at present.

In the ritual method, he

Mandates Methods

The Conklin bill, which has
been introduced annually for
the last several years, would
'gmandiate humane methods of
killing livestock. It does these
things: ,

o Requires that the an-
imal be “rendered insensible
to pain” by rapid and effec-
tive means, such as electric
shack, before it is slaugh-
tered.

. o Prohibits shackling and
hoisting the animal into po-
sition for slaughter, or using
any other method which
wouldcau-se injury or pain.

0 Permits a method in ac-
cordance with the require-
ments of Jewish ritual slaugh-
ter.

The Jewish Community
ICouncils and the American

Council for Judaism differ on'

one key point. It is the com-
»munity council position that

the bill is contradictory, be-'

,cause shackling and hoisting
have long been. part of the
ritual slaughtering process.
The councils have expressed
hope that action on the bill

Humane Slaughter
‘Bill th’d by Group

The American Council for
Judaism today gave its sup-

port “on moral grounds” to

the aims of a humane slaugh-

to the New York State Legisla-
ture.

In a letter to Gov. Rocke-
feller, Richard L. Simon, re-
gional vice president of ACJ,
said the Conklin-Marano bill
provides “absolute protection”
for shechita, the Jewish ritual
in the slaughter of livestock.
He said there was nothing in
the bill “prejudicial to any
observance of the religion of.
J udaism.”

In answer to Mr. Simon’s
letter, a spokesman for the
Union of Orthodox Jewish Con-
gregations of America called
the bill “an intrusion by the
state into an area of religious
practice.” The spokesman said
the legislation offered no new
alternative that could replace
the present slaughter method

the United States in this or},
any other issue,” Richard L.§

 

Simon, New York regional vice-
president of the American'
Council for Judaism. said to-
day. .

He referied to legislation for
humane slaughtei of animawls '1

In a. letter to Gov. Rocke—
feller, expressed ACJ's
“moral” support for the aims
of such bills recently intro-
duced in the State Legislature
by two Brooklyn Republicans,
Sen. William R. Conklin and
Assemblyman Iuigi R. Marano.

Mr. Simon said the proposed
bills “provide absolute protec-
tion for shechita, the ritual
method of slaughter required
by some denominations in
Judaism."

NEW LAWS OPPOSED

At the same time, he said,
the bills seek primarily to elim-
inate grossly cruel methods of
handling animals at meat-
puacking plants prior to actual
slaughter.

Mr. Simon said some~organi-
zations of Jews had opposed

he

 

cidedly more humane. He said
these 01 gamzations in lobbying
against the bills, often purport-

ed “to speak for virtually all -
American Jews.” No one organ-g ‘

ization can make any such

 

claim, he asserted. I

Mrs. Christine Stevens

Society for Animal Protective Legislation
745 Fifth Avenue

New York 22, New York

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

I have been grateful to the Daily Argus of Mount
Vernon for carrying the exchange of correspondence between us
concerning humane slaughtering legislation. As an officer of
your organization, you very properly have felt it your
responsibility to defend the position various humane societies
have taken with reference to the Conklin Bill. Since I have
had a minor role in helping to determine the policy of the
Jewish community, I have felt it to be my duty to set forth
the reasons for the position the Jewish community has taken
toward this legislation.

In all probability you have seen a copy of my last
letter as it appeared in the Daily Argus. Unfortunately, the
editor deleted several paragraphs from my last letter which,
in my opinion, serve to misrepresent the position which I had
taken. I, therefore, am enclosing herewith the full text of the
letter as I had originally submitted it to the Daily Argus. I
am certain.that there is nothing in this letter that you have
not previously heard in connection-with this difference of
opinion between us.

I believe that such public exchangesof opinion are
all for the common good. I wish that it were possible for
members of the Jewish community and the humane societies to
resume the face to face discussions that have already taken place
between responsible representatives on this problem.

Very o ially yours,

iTAaron H. Blumenthal

 




9.9.21

TO: EDITOR OF THE DAILY ARGUS FROM RABBI AARON H. BLUMENTHAL - June 6, 1962

Permit me to commend the Argus for printing the exchange of correspondence
between Mrs. Stevens and me about humane slaughtering. Perhaps in this way we can
contribute to an understanding of the issues involved.

Had the bills originally introduced in the Congress of the United States
in 1958, or in the N. Y. Legislature in 1959, 1960 and 1961 been passed, they would
have marked the end of kosher meat in N. Y. State. There were no handling pens
available then. This, however, did not deter the various societies from pressing
for the legislation. I referred to this as a "callous indifference to the needs
of human beings." There can be no argument about these conclusions.

The development of holding pens looked more promising early in 1962. The
Jewish community embarked upon a research project conducted by the Armour Research
Foundation of the Illinois InStitute of Technology late in 1959, for the purpose
of developing new ones. The weinberg pen employed in England was found to be
inadequate. The pens used in Toronto and Montreal, were examined and recommended.
Members of the various humane societies also examined and approved of them. The
Department of Agriculture, however, found them to be unacceptable for various
reasons. Finally, Cross Bros. of Philadelphia which is engaged in the business of
kosher slaughtering developed a pen which is acceptable. Food Handling Machinery
Corp., also of Philadelphia, to which Mrs. Stevens referred, only recently has
been designated as the company to manufacture the pens. Whether the pens will be
available in large numbers before January 1, 1963 still is a moot question.

There certainly was no way of knowing whether they would be available at all when
the Conklin Bill was introduced. I maintain that the animal protective societies
should have waited until we had been assured that the supply of kosher meats
would not be interrupted before insisting upon the legislation. Furthermore,
smaller animals also are suspended before slaughtering. Pens must be devised for
this purpose and there is not even a working model for a smaller pen.

But this does not get to the heart of the problem.as a large segment of
the Jewish community sees it. Mrs. Stevens' Society for Animal Protective Legis-
lation is only one of many in the field. They are extremely well organized both
nationally and internationally. They meet regularly in international conventions.
Unfortunately, humane slaughtering legislation has an ugly history in Europe. It
has been espoused by every vicious anti-semitic element in the gutters of European
thought. The humane societies cannot be proud of the fact that the Nazis cham-
pioned their cause and enacted their legislation as soon as they had the power to
do so. The backwash of this loathsome episode is still with us. As recently as
April 1962, the German Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Hamburg
called upon the Bonn Government to outlaw kosher slaughtering. The meeting in
Hamburg witnessed a demonstration of the "brutal act" of kosher animal slaughter,
despite the universal recognition, even by the humane societies in this country,
that ritual slaughter is among the most humane.

 




-2-

Here lies the true rub of the matter. The history of this kind of legis-
lation in Europe indicates that the real objective is the elimination of kosher
slaughtering. For the time being let us ignore the many illustrations on the
Continent. The example of enlightened England will suffice. On July 28, 1933
a law was passed in England providing for the electrical.stunning of all animals
before slaughter, with a clear proviso exempting animals for Jewish and Mohammedan
slaughter. In December 195A a bill was introduced to abolish this exemption.

The bill did not pass but its proponents returned to the assault. The Royal
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals published a pamphlet titled
"Legalized Cruelty." On the cover is a drawing of a bearded ritual slaughterer
armed with a long knife, standing near a Weinberg pen from.which the head of an
animal protrudes. The use of the Weinberg pen in England did not deter the Royal
Society from.their campaign against ritual slaughter as such. Similar attacks
have been made in the Dominion of Canada.

Will the same thing happen here? It is easy for others to reassure us,
but I hope that we will be forgiven for being suspicious, in view of the inter-
national associates of our humane societies.

These suspicions are reinforced by the failure of the societies to address
themselves to a far more cruel problem. The issue of a holding pen versus hoisting
is a simple one. It concerns the manner in which a number of animals are to spend
the last few moments of their lives.....whether they are to be hemmed into a pen
and slaughtered, or whether they are to be suspended by a leg and slaughtered.

Not a single animal life will be spared if the decision goes one way or the other.

But it is possible to save countless thousands of animal lives, not to
speak of the hundreds of human lives, sacrificed to the "sport" of hunting. It
is possible to put an end to the decimation of our bird population. And what
about game fishing? How many of these creatures no less sweet and innocent than
the animals in the abbatoirs are maimed and left to bleed to death, or to be
devoured alive by their natural enemies? ‘

Moreover, there is a logical consequence to this deep concern for cruelty
to animals, and that is vegetarianism. Where is the propaganda for vegetarianism.
which undoubtedly will save millions of animal lives? The Jewish community has a
right to ask why the humane societies deliberately choose to dedicate
their energies towards the elimination of suspending doomed animals in preference
' to the saving of millions of animal lives by the alternative proposals available
to them. One is reminded of the humanitarian who insisted that the blindfold on
a man unjustly condemned to die before a firing squad be made of silk, lest a
rougher cloth bruise his skin. Perhaps this was his rationalization for doing
nothing about the injustice.

The various societies are not all of one mind. The animal protective
societies reject the anti-vivisection campaign, but others do not. Some of them
are concerned with cruelty to children, others are not. One never knows which
facet of this broad movement will take the initiative.

 




-3-

The position of the Jewish community is a simple one. Briefly stated it.
is as follows: Legislation was necessary to eliminate the unspeakable cruelties
practised in the slaughter of non-kosher animals. This has been done. Legis-
lation is not necessary to solve the problems involved in kosher slaughtering.
As soon as holding pens or any other improving devices are available, they will
be introduced by the Jewish community. In View of the history of this kind of
legislation, we are opposed to any outside intrusion in this area. If this
voluntary effort on our part should fail, it is my personal opinion that a large
proportion of the Jewish community will press for the necessary legislation, with
or without the humane societies.

In the meantime, the humane societies can help in the process of persua-
sion. They certainly can address themselves to the problem of saving animal

lives. They will be surprised by the number of Jews who would be glad to join
them.

Ethnic Considerations

There is a seriouscrror, either of language
or intent, in the article on El Al Airlines
in your Dec. 18 issue (p. 38). The au-
thor says, “The Jews and the Irish tend
to ride their own national airline, if possible,
no matter where they live now."

\Vhatever may be the conception of
Jews held by El Al Airlines. it is an estab-
lished fact that in the United States of
America Jews are recognized as full and
equal nationals of the United States. Their

identiﬁcation as Jews is by virtue of their

voluntary association with a historic re-
ligion of universal values—not with a
foreign nationalism.

There may be other ideas about what
Americans of Jewish faith are, or ought to
be, but they are contrary to the whole
spirit and historic development of American
democracy.

There is no American national airline
But if there were, it would be the national
airline of American Jews—as of all other
Americans. E," Al is the national airline
of the State ' a Israel—a nation as foreign

Americans.

TO use “Irish" and “Jew" as if they were
descriptive of the same category of human
interests or characteristics is also erroneous.
“Irish” is a national designation and it
includes a considerable number of indi-
viduals of Jewish faith.

The proper legal name for the Zionist
state in the Levant is “The State of
Israel.”

It is not a “Jewish” state, except in
prepaganda which is partisan to the idea
that Jews are, as chs, a nationality.
Citizens of The State of Israel ‘are of
Jewish, Christian and Moslem faiths and

the accurate description of their nationality
is “Israeli."

Your readers are entitled to know that
The American Council for Judaism is» an
organized group of Americans of Jewish
faith dedicated to the following American
concepts:

“Nationality and religion are separate and
distinct. Our nationality is .r'\mcrican, our
religionjs Judaism. Our homeland is the
United States Of America—not The State
of Israel.

“\Ve reject any concept that Jews outside
Of Israel are in ‘exilc.’

“The nationalism of Israel must be con-

w

ﬁned to the boundaries of that State. Its

spokesmen, representatives, agencies and in-
striuncutalitics in no way represent us. No
Jew or group of Jews can speak for, or rcprei
sent, all the Jews of America.”

KENNEDY URGED TO RESIST ZIONIST ATTACKS ON HIM
—The ACJ national executive committee April 16 urged President Kennedy
to reject the latest Zionist-inspired attacks on the US. Government. Zionists
are repeatedly condemning the Administration for co-sponsoring the United
Nations censure of Israel, April 9. Clarence L. Coleman J r., ACJ president,
said the present campaign “follows the customary strategy of an organized
Zionist mechanism operating in the United States, attempting to make it
appear that it represents ‘American Jewry’ and then, in a wholly unwarranted
representative capacity, attempting to inﬂuence American policy-makers by
threats of political reprisals and pressure campaigns.” Mr. Coleman denied
there is a bloc, designated as “Jews,” in the American electorate. The ACJ
letter approved the U.S.—U.N. action as based on a policy “dictated by the
facts, supplied by the best informed and most impartial source available.”
The Security Council voted 10-0 to censure Israel for its retaliatory raids
on Syria, March 1’6—17. American Ambassador Adlai Stevenson termed
the Israeli attack “unjustiﬁable.” The Presidents Conference of non—Zionist
and Zionist organizations made two strong public attacks on the American
action and mobilized political pressure against the Administration. “The
American Zionist,” oﬂicial ZOA paper, headlined the incident: “Zionist
Leaders Score US, UN on Mideast Peace; Spur Aliya.” (Aliya, of course,

is immigration of US. Jews into Israel.)

INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM IS “OLD FASHIONED” — Zvi Lurie, head of
the Jewish Agency organization department, told a London audience
that Jews outside Israel are “living in a state of diminishing security."
For example, he said, Algerian leaders were offering Jews an “old
fashioned formula — ‘to the Jewish citizen as an individual everything,
to the Jews as an ethnic group nothing.’ ” This paraphrases France’s
commitment to Jews during the 18th century. That resulted in emancipa-
tion. Mr. Lurie dubs this “old fashioned.”

Rabbi Cites Threat to
Status of U. S. Jews

BY WALTER. BILITZ
[Chicago Tribune Press SerVice]
New York, March 28 —~ An
American rabbi charged to—
night that the Eichmann trial

was, “a declaration of w’a r” »
against the rights and political '

status of American Jews.

In an address before the
American Council for Judaism,
Rabbi Elmer Berger, the coun-
cil’s executive vice president,
cited the language of the court’s

most dramatic examples of
Zionism’s exploitation of th e
emotional situation” to advance
its claims on Jews everywhere.

Phrase of Zionists

Berger objected in particular
to theirequent use of the
words, “the Jewish people,” in-
‘the verdict, calling it “a politi-
cal national concept” of the
ZioniSts to lay claims on all
Jews. He made clear, however,
that he had no quarrel with
the actual verdict itself.

The council is composed of

As proof, he noted astate de-
partment r u l i n g requiring
“Americans of Jewish—but no
other—faith to repudiate Israeli
nationality. . . . if the prospec-
tive immigrant [to Israel] does
not want to acquire such na-
ltionali-ty.” Such a procedure is
discriminatory and based on an
erroneous assumption, Berger
said.

Zionist claims and efforts. “The

LYNDON B. JOHNSON GREETS AMERICAN COUNCIL FOR JUDAISM,
HAILS "RELIGIOUS AND PHILANTHROPIC" WORK.
Chicago-~May 10—- Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, by letter, greet-
ed delegates of the American Council for Judaism whose 18th Annual
Conference opens here today. Chester Bowles, special White House
representative, joined former President Eisenhower and several
.members of the Kennedy cabinet in statements to the Council.

The Vice President said that "in these times of great threats
and challenges to religious men and free men," the work of the Council
"is most gratifying." He added: ”May the religious and philanthrOpic
results of your work accrue to the betterment of our nation as a whole,
and to the benefit of all mankind."

The messages were released by Clarence L. Coleman Jr., of
Chicago, Council president. The four-day meeting will expand Council
programs in the fields of public affairs, religious education and
philanthropy.

Governor Otto Kerner of Illinois sent a welcoming letter

especially greeting Illin01$ delegates. Among others who sent

messages of greeting to the opening of the Conference were clergymen,

educators, congressmen and government leaders.

Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote that he had long
Wheen impressed with the contribution the American Council for‘
Judaism.has made in increasing public understanding of traditional
American principles.“ He paid tribute to the Council's help in

furthering "our country's international policies and prestige.“

Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon declared that the
Council's Annual Conference "represents the reassertion of what is
perhaps the greatest underlying strength of our Ehtion: the freedom.
to engage wholeheartedly in the religious worship of our choice." He
said that "our country is the better" for the Council's dedication to
"these religious and cultural values which flourish to their.maximum
degree only in a climate of freedom."

Chester Bowles lauded the Council for its efforts on behalf of
"international friendship and good will" which, he said, were depend~
ent on "an understanding, appreciation, and tolerance of the legiti—
mate aspirations of others by individual citizens as well as their
governments.“

Arthur J. Goldberg, Secretary of Labor, said that the Council
"has contributed greatly to defining and cultivating individual
responsibility for achieving the highest goals of American life,"
which he defined as “the responsibilities the people bear, one to
another, for the common welfare."

Norman Thomas, six-time candidate for the Presidency, said that
the Council "while loyal to Judaism and appreciative of whatever is
to be praised in Israel, lives and works in the honest belief that
above all nations is humanity.“

Three leaders of British public life also sent Conference
greetings. Sir Norman Angeli, Nobel Peace Prize winner, praised the
Council's recognition "of the dire need to clarify the right relation-
ship of race, or religious faith, to political loyalties." This was
a reference to the State of Israel's nationalism which seeks to bestow
political reSponsibilities to it on all Jews wherever they may live.
Sir Louis Gluckstein, former member of the English Parliament,
expressed his agreement with the aims of the Council and deplored "the
handicaps under which Jews the world over are laboring as a result of

misplaced Zionist zeal." R. N. Carvalho, president of the Anglo-

Jewish Association. noted "the inter-relationship of our national

status and obligations as citizens of our particular countries with
the very natural bonds which all Jews, wherever they are, share.“

Other messages were received from Mayor Robert F. Wagner of
New York City; Henry Cabot.Lodge, former U.S. Ambassador to the United
Nations; and Arch N. Booth, executive vice president, U.S. Chamber of
Commerce.

Messages from educators and clergymen included John A. Hannah.
President, Michigan State University; Philip K. Hitti, Department of
Oriental Studies, Princeton University; William Ernest Hocking,
Alford Professor Emeritus, Harvard University; and Rev. Harry Emerson
Fosdick, pastor emeritus, Riverside Church of New York.

The Council's work on behalf of humane slaughter legislation in
New York State was reflected in messages from Fred Myers, executive
director of the Humane Society of the United States; Helen E. Jones,
executive director, the National Catholic Society for Animal Welfare;
and Mrs. Christine Stevens, president, Animal Welfare Institute.

Featured speaker at the opening dinner tonight will be Rabbi
Elmer Berger, of New York, Council executive vice~president, on the

MAR 2 2 196?

A bill, similar to one passed by the
Federal government and 12 states, is
presently before the New York State
Legislature. Its subject
slaughter, and the objective is to make
meat animals “rapidly and mercifully in—
sensible to pain” before processi'ig is
begun.

The problem is that " this bill has
been rejected by the Legislature for
the past three years. It’s high time the
measure passed. .Without getting into
the sordid details, it’s enough to say
that the methods of slaughter still used
. in some smaller packing houses are ex-
tremely painful to the animals involved.

Congress took a long set forward in 1958
' by passing a humane slaughter law pro-
viding that animals slaughtered for the
Federal government must be killed by
humane methods. But the states must
sweep their own homes, leaving packers
involved .only in intra-state trade un-
affected by the Federal law.

Humane methods include carbon di-
oxide anesthetization, captivebolt pistols,

u Lin-H‘db

' ,sgunshot'or electric stunning. The mech-

anisms involved vary in expense, but

ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER

COMMISSIONER

April 17, 1962

Mrs. Christine Stevens, SecretaryaTreasurer
Society for Animal Protective Legislation
745 Fifth Avenue

New York 22, New York

Dear Mrs. Stevens:
Q 5, As a regulatory agency of the State Govern—
?” “ment, the Department of Agriculture and Markets enforces
”Tthe New York State agriculture and Markets law and Rules
a "and Regulations covering related fields.

No policy statement has been issued by this
Department on the subject of humane slaughter.

The Agriculture-law does not contain a
definition of 'humane' slaughter. Therefore, this
Department has no authority for regulating the manner in
which animals may be slaughtered other than jurisdiction
over sanitary conditions at slaughtering plants.

While the Department does not establish
policy, it enforces the law; and I wish to say that the
Department is opposed in principle to subjecting animals
during slaughter to means which would cause unnecessary
discomfort, pain or suffering.

Thank you for your interest in this matter.

Very sincerely yours,

HUMANE SLAUGHTER

 

A lot of people Who enjoy a nice juicy steak might easily
choke on it if they knew What went on in many slaughter~houses.

Now there are ways of killing animals without torture. And
State Senator‘William Conklin wants to make these mandatory.

The Conklin bill would not interfere with the traditional
method of killing animals prescribed for orthodox Jews. It would
only outlaw inhumane handling before slaughter.

To comply with the bill, many big slaughter~houses would have
to install new equipment. Such equipment, for handling cattle,
should easily be available within the time limit set by the Senator.

But there is a question whether similar equipment will be
available for handling other animals within this time limit. And
for that reason, WMCA suggests that the period allowed for compliance
might be extended.

So amendcdq there can be no reasonable objection to passage of
theConklin bill immediately. WMCA believes the Conklin bill on

humane slaughter should be enacted now.

Out/aw Boxing? This Housewife Says "Yes!"

East Islip—Should boxing be outlawed? For
these reasons I believe it should be.

A human life is priceless. We live in order not .

to die. Men and women dedicate their lives in
many fields to protect life, as proof of this.
A law was passed protecting birds from being

sent into a ring armed with spur—like weapons, to '

fight one another. These cockfights which men

enjoyed gambling on proved to be an ugly, cruel,

sport.
Fighters are trained and brainwashed to knock

out their opponents in the ring. In so doing they 1

are armed with hard gloves—punching, disfiguring,

. even killing another human being. This lowest form ‘

of sport men enjoy watching and even use it for
- gambling purposes. 3
Football players are not out to fight. one an—

other iphysically. The sport alone, plus protection

from the helmets they wear, keep these men alive.
Boxers are put into a ring to fight, not to be

protected by anyone or anything. That is why this 4,

lowest, cruel sport should be outlawed.

What Is Humane?

lished letters from people who support the Conk-
lin Bill which is now before the New York State
Assembly.

Any bill which would help to alleviate the suf— .
rfering of animals which ”are slaughtered for meat :
should haVe the full support of everyone. However,

it is hard to see how the Conklin .Bill will in any
way lessen the suffering of animals it is supposed
to benefit. , '

won’t eliminate pain. Nor, at this point, would it
virtually impossible to slay‘guhmterman animal (espe—
cially a steer) in the must painless and humane

way known: the ritual of slaughter p-ra-ctiEed"""o'y

against brutality.
This bill would, however, permit continuance

 

lessen the animal’s fright. This bill only makes it ;

of a commonly used slaughter method which I .
once witnessed in utter horror, in which a man ‘
repeatedly strikes a steer in the head with a sledge :
hammer until the‘stunned and suffering animal
loses consciousness, after which he is bled to death. ‘

\Vhile we might forgive the bill for its total
ineffectiveness against brutality to animals, we most
certainly must oppose it for the reason that it
amounts to a clumsy curtailment of religious free-

dom for the many devout Jewish Americans.

Spoiling the Spirit

Hempstead Moe Amsel, whose letter appeared
in the March 26 issue of Newsday, interests me
very much. His indignation at being mistaken for
an Orthodox Jew is surprising, to say the least.

[I was brought up in an Orthodox home and

attended Orthodox Synagogues most of my 52 years.
I have nothing but admiration for those Jews who

‘ choose to follow our Torah’s teachings to the letter

and embrace its precepts as their way of life, as
taught by our forebears.
