“ The Neighbours ” is an animal anthology,
collected and illustrated by Fougasse, and published
by Methuen & Co. Ltd, at 7/6d.

The work of amassing and weeding out poems
and paragraphs for this anthology has been in progress
since long before the war, and the collection has a
unique character. While it includes some old favourites,
such as Dr. Johnson on Hodge (and don’t miss the
expression on Hodge’s face), readers will ﬁnd many
novelties in a selection which ranges from an ancient
Greek epitaph on a dog, through a plea for ﬂeas by
a mediaeval Arab poet, to an apology addressed to
a trapped mouse in a magazine published by prisoners
of war in a Stalag.

There are oVer a hundred illustrations land'iﬁthoSe
who know Fougasse only as a humorous artist will
be delighted to discover his grace in portraying such
gentle things as donkeys on the road to Paradise.
