Dear Prof. Regan:

When I talked to him in Montreal recently, Sheldon Wein told me
that you are putting together a series of philosophy texts, and
thought that that series might be a suitable location for a

philosophy of language text I’m writing. The thing is designed
as a short (ES-70,000 wds) introductory text, presupposing no
background, and giving a reasonably comprehensive up-to-date view
of the field--what Alston’s book in the Prentice-Hall Foundations
series is supposed to do but doesn’t. I enclose a tentative
table of contents. I’ve now finished a second draft of it, and
expect to have a more-or-less final version by September or so.

If the book fits your series and sounds at all interesting to
you, please let me know, and I can send a fuller prospectus for
it, or the whole preliminary draft at its current state.

Yours very truly,

Mica,

Robert M. Martin
Associate Professor

Dear Tbm:

I write because I understand that you are to be the general editor of

a series of introductOry texts on various philosophic areas. If this

is so, you might be interested in.a.nenuscript I know of. The manuscript
was written by Professor Robert Martin, Department of Philosophy, Dalhousie
Uhiversity, Halifax, NOva Scotia, Canada, B3H 3J5, Telephone (902) 424—3811.
I have not actually read the ms. so I cannot say how good it is. Hewever,
I do know this much about it. It is an introductory text on the Philosophy
of Language. I understand (from talking with Martin) that it covers the
basic areas in.contemporary analytic Phil of Language. I know Martin.

quite well and have read quite a bit of what he has written. I would

be very suprised if the Phil of Language text he has written is not

quite good. Bob Martin is one of those rare writers who can.explain
complex philosophic positions in a remarkably clear way in a very short
space. So, if you are looking for a Phil of Language text for the series

I think.you.would be wise to get in touch with Martin. I don't think

you would regret taking a loOk at his ms.

I would also appreciate it if you.would send me any information on the
MOOre Society meetings in washington this coming December. My own work
has recently involved looking at various things Meore wrote and I might
like to attend the meetings. Thanks for this.

Hope everything is going well for you. I am doing just fine. (I am
really enjoying Mentréal and have every reason to think that I am going
to love being here.)

Dear Peter—

Here is an miscanellany of material
we might consider, Let me know what you
think. I'll keep looking for other stuff,

On a different matter: Jim Rachels has

just published the first book in the 14
volume series I'm editing for Random House,
As you might eXpect, it is a superb intro—
ductmtion to ethics, It sets a very high
standard. I'd like to interest you in
doing the volume in political philosophy,
(Dale is doing the one in aesthetics), I
understand how busy you are and why you
might have to say no to almost every new
thing. But I can work at a fairly lesiurely
pace on this, giving you, say, two years to
do the book (ZOO-ZQO pages in typescript),
It shouldn't be too onerous and might even

L)“

afford you a nice diversion from your normal
concerns, You's also edit an accompanying

reader and c ntribpte somethip:r itedﬂversions
of your bOOK? to 0 her progec‘g1 buy, again,
the pace wou d be slow, I recal- aSking you

about this once before, and your having declined,
You may d the same this time around, But I
thought f chance it, There's no one I'd rather

have involved. Let me knoW.... ,,/”'

 

All good Wishes to you, Renata, and the childr n-

February 1, 1988

Dear Animals Man, Moore Interpreter,
Ryle Lecturer, and what's more to the
point here, Heritage Series Editor:

I'm working on the anthology again, and I think it would be a big
help if I could get your reaction to some thoughts I'm having.

Rhetorical question: What was wrong with my earlier manuscript?
It seems to me now that the problem wasn't so much in the details as in
the overall approach. It was a peculiar, confusing, uninviting table
of contents, followed by a mass of material that required too much
effort to wade through and figure out.

It pains me to say this, considering how much time I spent on that
manuscript. But time gives one a better perspective, and I now think
that earlier effort was a mess.

So now I am thinking about a totally different approach: a
shorter, simpler book with a minimum of editorial matter. (The
editorial matter would consist of two introductory essays, at the
beginning of the book, plus the customary one-or-two-paragraph
introductions to each article, explaining who the authors are, etc.)

It seems to me that this approach might result in an attractive
book. (See the enclosed table of contents.)

Possible objection to the enclosed table of contents: This is
much more of a "companion" to The Elements of Mbral Philosophy, and
less of a stand-alone anthology. It includes readings on the main
ethical theories, by the advocates of those theories. But it does not
include separate articles critical of each theory. Moreover, the
"essays on moral issues" portion of the book provides only two articles
on each issue, rather than a whole range of articles on each issue.

BUT . . . in order for this anthology to be a proper companion to
Elements, it has to cover eight moral theories and (at least!) eight
"issues." That's a lot; as you can see, even the present skimpy
coverage requires 28 selections. In order to provide separate critical
articles about each theory, plus a greater range of articles on each
issue, it would have to be a MUCH bigger book.

So, my present thinking is that it's best to go with a leaner,
more stripped-down approach, which would still be a pretty substantial

book, but not a giant book.

 




And, the enclosed contents represents a book that could be used on
its own. I personally would have no qualms about using it as the
single text in my course.

Anyway, what do you think? Let's talk on the telephone about
this.

Dear Steve:

Herewith Carter's manuscript of the metaphysics' book. Randy
and I have worked on this carefully over the past year or so:
and in my opinion it is ready for publication. I believe it
sets a standard for introductory books in metaphysics comparable
to the standard set by Rachels's book for introductory texts

in ethics. I hope you'll agree and that production will get
underway as soon as possible.

Carter will be out of the country for six weeks, leaving mid-

May. Depending on the production schedule, you can catch him
either in or out of the States. Whichever alternative obtains,

I am confident Randy will be able to turn the manuscript around
quickly. Availability for the December 1988 APA meeting therefore
seems achieveable. Know that I will be pleased to help in any

way I can.

With every good wish.

Dear Tom:

Thanks for the progress report on The Heritage Series. I
had not begun to despair, but, in truth, I worried some.

The schedule, particularly for Rachels, will be tight. But
we might just be able to get his book for the APA if two
things happen. Perhaps that's three things. First, I will
need a chunk of the manuscript as soon as possible. We can
begin design, copyediting, and scheduling with a
significant portion of the manuscript. Is that possible?
Second, I will need the permissions summary at
Rachels'earliest convenience. With the summary in hand we
can begin the permissions search and save some time in the
middle of the schedule. Finally, we'll need your commitment
and Jim's to turn material around quickly. That was not a
problem with Elements, but we need to know in advance that
we can count on speedy delivery of copyedited manuscript
and of proof stages.

Carter should be doable as is, but turnaround will be
critical. Will his schedule permit it?

Finally, APA is a desirable target, but it is not the be—
all—and-end-all. Publishing either of these books in mid-
to—late January is perfectly acceptable from a marketing
point of View. And if we don't publish something soon, the
Series will have lost the momentum of Jim Rachels' success.
I can understand your desire for timely production, but
timely production is infinitely easier when manuscripts are
delivered on time. Everyone will be better served if we
publish some more of the Series in 1989. Certainly Rachels'
reader will benefit from the sales of the text more than it
will benefit from being ready for the APA.

I am anxious for us to do our part in getting the Series
out, but we do need manuscripts. I would like to think that
we can do the Rachels reader and the Carter text for 1989
and that we could publish the Jamieson and Aiken texts with
the Carter reader in 1990. Doing so could establish the
Series solidly in the discipline's mind. Difficult to do

 




that with a single, however successful, book.

Again, thank you for the report. Let me know what you think
about the possible scheduling.

Sincerely,
,ﬁ/

Thank you very much for your letter of l l April. l was pleased to
learn that you think well of Jim Rachels‘s book, THE ELEMENTS BF
ripest PHILUSBPHV. It seems to have attracted a large (and
growing) readership.

i do plan to add a comparable volume in the area of political/social
philosophy, and i already have contracted with another fine writer
and thinker~~Will Aiken~-to write this book. if all goes well, this

volume will he completed by the end of 1989. i shall certainly see

that you receive a copy, when it is available.

in the meantime, thank you again for your interest in the Heritage

CHATHAM

June 27,1988

 

Dear Tom,

I am sorry that I am not able to tell you this on the phone, but I will be off on
a family visit the day before you return from California. I must communicate now, even
though thlS letter is most painful to write.

Tom, I must bluntly tell you that I cannot complete the book. It is a month past
the contracted completion date. I am not done, nor am I anywhere near being done.
And I doubt that I could complete it even with two more years to work on it.

I think the best thing to do is to beg permission to terminate the contract,
return the $500 advance to Random House (see enclosed check ), and let you find
someone else who can do a good job for you. ( I would suggest several good women:
esp. Amy Gutman, Carole Pateman, or Diane Myers).

I feel terrible about this for you have been so patient, so supportative, and have
done more to enhance my career opportunities and future propects than could ever
be asked of a friend. I have failed to live up to your expectations, I have belied
the confidence you showed in my ability, and I have betrayed the confidence which
you showed in me especially to your publisher. Please forgive me. Though I owe
you more than a mere apology, perhaps some explanation for my failure will help
you to see why I cannot go on. ’

Much of the fault lies in the general emotional malaise and intellectual stupor
I have suffered for the past three years. For whatever reason -- be it mid-life
crisis, conflicting family obligations, lack of ambition, loss of compativeness,
or loss of confidence in my capability to add anything significant -- my philosophical
life has been sporatic, reactive, undisciplined, and rather sterile. Intellectually
my interests have been shifting toward literature, intellectual history, and
and "virtue” ethics. ~

I thought when you gave me the chance to write this book, that I could gird up
my loins and sit down and methodologically churn out a pretty good,useful,little
introductibn volume. And I thought that this project would put me back on the
track of a career and would bolster my scholarly pride. Perhaps it would have if I
could have mustered the will power last Summer to grind it out. But I could not.
Rather I spent the Summer randomly jotting down disorganized notes on scraps of
of paper, and reading around in political philosophy with no plan or structure,
and in accumlating more and more books that just hag_to be read before I ventured
to write. When the school year started again I knew I would be pressed, as indeed
I was, to find time to write. But I still became further and further enmeshed in

By about Christmas I was becoming painfuIIy aware that I was not going to b
to write a good book by May 15 because I reaIized that my knowIedge of poIiticaI
phiIosophy was inadequate. It was woefuIIy restricted to the questions and the
buiIt in biases of the IiberaI tradition. My basic ignorance of the non-anaIyti
inteIIectuaI foundations of the other theories was not going to be surmounted by
a brief spurge of reading. But I thought I wouId try to ignore aII that and
pretend to be an expert and write the book as if I chose to Iimit it to the
debates of IiberaIism. Throughout the Winter I tried. But I faiIed because
the other perspectives and their impIicit criticism kept haunting me and kept
ungercutting the importance of what I was attempting to do. So in frustration

idn't do it.

And what was worst, I began to discover that I don't know what I think
about poIiticaI phiIosophy anymore. I became as if stung by Socrates and
as bIathering as Euthyphro. I have coanicting onaIities and hoId disparate
poIiticaI vaIues. And I can not make a commitment to any poIiticaI theory.
or even systematic organization of those vaIues. I bounce back and forth
and have been tempted to reduce aII poIiticaI theory to so much ideoIogy
around which rationaI argument is irreIevant. I became particuIarIy disturbed
by some of the feminist critiques of poIiticaI theory and morai theory which
shook my confidence in the very tooIs of anaIysis and argumentation in which
I have been trained. By the time your March inquiry Ietter arrived, I had
Iost aII confidence in my abiIity to write this book.

, But I tried one more time to rev up the motor- to overcome my seIf doubt,
the growing fear of criticism and the feeIing of being a charIatan. Once
again I faiIed to produce anything worthwhiIe and Iapsed back into reading and
increasing confusion. May 15 came. Now it is the end of June.

The time has come to stop fooIing myseIf and you. I can't write a book
about a subject that I am confused over, in a fieId that I have even begun to
question the basic vaIidity of its methodoIogy. I simpIy am not capabIe of
writing anything worthwhiIe in this area right now.

I must face the sad truth at Iast that I have faiIed before myseIf and
you. I am sorry that I have disappointed you, that I have embarassed you
in front of your puinshers, and that I have harmed the puincation scheduIe
and pianning of the Heritage Series. PIease try to forgive me.

Sincerer yours,

Dear Professor Regan:

Randy Carter, I understand, has suggested me as a possible author for the epistemology book in
the Heritage Series of which you are the editor. I am interested in writing this book, and I would like to
suggest to you some ideas on how I conceive of it.

My approach would be systematic, not historical, but I would, where relevant, discuss Descartes,
Locke, Hume, and Kant. In order to go beyond the standard topics discussed in introductory
epistemology books that are currently on the market (Pollock, Audi, Dancy, O’Connor-Carr), I suggest
including sections on the following topics: epistemic duties and the ethics of belief, the relation between
epistemic reasonableness and overall rationality, the project of naturalizing epistemology, problems of
confirmation (the old and the new riddle of induction, Hempel’s raven paradox). The first of these topics is
of special concern to me; I am working on a couple of papers on epistemic deontology, and I shall present
a paper on epistemic duties at this year’s Pacific Division Meeting of the APA. In the past two decades, the
ethics of belief has not received much attention, which is, in my opinion, unfortunate. Under the heading of
knowledge and rationality, I would include sections on critical rationalism, cognitive relativism, and
scientific revolutions (Popper, Lakatos, Kuhn, Feyerabend). It goes without saying that, without sacrificing
depth, I would keep things at the introductory level.

Since the format of your series calls for a textbook with an accompanying anthology, I would
organize the materials in such a way that, chapter by chapter, they correspond to, and can be read along
with, the readings gathered in the anthology. I would aim at having the anthology put together by the time
I finished the book, so that both could come out simultaneously.

A textbook including both the standard topics (knowledge as justified true belief, Gettier problem,
foundationalism versus coherentism, etc.) and the topics I mentioned would call for a comprehensive
format, probably requiring about 220 pages. I believe, however, that it would make the book highly
competitive; to my knowlege, no introductory epistemology textbook of comparable scope is currently
available.

 




I believe I could finish the project within two years. In October, I shall participate as a
commentator in the Spindel conference on moral epistemology, but I have no commitments in addition to
this one. My teaching load at St. Cloud State is light; it leaves me plenty of time for pursuing my own
projects.

I hope my proposal looks interesting to you. Should you decide to offer me the job, I shall be, of
course, perfectly willing to accommodate the needs of the publishers and make changes as necessary.

Thank you for your consideration. I look fon/vard to hearing from you.

Yours,

Matthias Steup

Dear Professor Steup:

Thank you for your recent letter. It is true that I am looking for someone to
write an introductory book in theory of knowledge, for the Heritage Series,
of which I am the general editor.

The description of the book you envision sounds appropriate for the series.
However, I will need a more detailed description of the book beforel could
take the proposal to the publisher.

Here’s what I think is needed. First, a draft of the first chapter; second, a
tentative Table of Contents; and, lastly, summaries of the chapters, as you
conceive them at this time. Of course all this is alterable. Still, it gives us
something to go on.

I want to make one thing clear: Even if you do all the things outlined in the
previous paragraph, I cannot guarantee acceptance. Minimally, such a
proposal would need to be sent out for review, and if the reviews were not
encouraging, it is unlikely that your proposal would be accepted. I’m sure
you understand.

I shall look fon/vard to hearing from you, at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely yours,

Tom Regan
Professor of Philosophy

Dale:

I think we have reached a point where a firm decision needs to
be made about your book on aesthetics. I have been more than
patient as month after month has passed without so much as a
word from you about the book, let alone a word in it. This cannot
continue. The longer your book is delayed, the more the
reputation and vitality of the Series are diminished.

Accordingly, I propose the following: Either you begin to
discharge those responsibilities for which you have contracted,
or we dissolve the contract. 0f the two options, I obviously
prefer that you choose the former. I continue to believe that you
are the right person to write the book, just as Jim was the right
one to write the book on ethics, Randy the right person for the
book on metaphysics, and Larry Thomas (who has just agreed to
do this) the right choice to write the book on social and
political philosophy.

But being the "right person" to write a book isn't much good if
the book isn't being written. As things stand for now, Dale, the

choice is yours.

Let me know what you decide. Soon.

Tom Regan

i have enclosed my review of Ja s Rachels’ 7776’ Heme/N‘s off/oral PM/osgo/zv. i
would like to thank you for aski g me to work on this project. i find that working
through this material has help d me to arrive at a better understanding of what I
want to accomplish in my Co temporary Moral Problems class. I would be happy to
consider assisting in any f ure review projects for which you might feel i am
well suited.

As i mentioned on the ph ne, i have some thoughts about working on a book of my
own. i have gone only 5 far as to sketch out some tentative chapter titles for a
short introductory text in epistemology. I would also be strongly interested in
working on a phil 0 re igion e . . ere texts already under contract in
both areas foﬁm would welcome any feedback

you might have concerning these projects.

Thank you again for asking for my thoughts on the Rachels book. i am eager to
work with you on future pro jects.

Dear Professor Tidman:

Thank you; I have received your comments on Rachels' THE ELEMENTS OF MORAL

PHILOSOPHY which will be extremely helpful to us as we prepare for the second
edition. '

The accounting department is now processing payment of your $125 honorarium.
These checks usually take 4-6 weeks to reach their destinations; if you do not
receive yours within that period of time, please let me know.

I've spoken with Cynthia Ward who is the sponsoring editor for the entire
PhilOSOphy list regarding your possible plans for authoring a text, and Cynthia
is interested in your ideas. There are no manuscripts under contract today in
either philosophy of religion or elements of epistemology, so I encourage you

to submit a prospectus for your proposed work. You can contact either Cynthia
or me if you'd like information on what your prospectus should optimally contain.
Cynthia can be reached at (212) 512—3046, or you can call me at the above number.

Thanks again for your assistance. I hope to hear from you.
Cordially,
WIEW‘LQQ
