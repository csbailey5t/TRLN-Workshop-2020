     "text": "THE MORAL ASPECT\nVIVISECTION.\n\nB Y\n\nE. JANE VVHATELY.\n\nIT is sometimes well for the instruction and encouraga\nment of those who give serious thought to the question\nof Vivisection, to recall the words of persons eminent for\nhigh qualities of intellect and of moral character, who\nhave passed judgment upon it. Miss E. Jane VVhately\n\ndaughter of Archbishop VVhately—was respected, trusted,\n\n. . . ’-\nand loved in no common degree by a large olrcle of friends\n\nand acquaintances.\n\nIn the preface to a short memoir of her, by her sister,\npublished in 1893, there is the following tribute to her\nworth from the pen of the well-known author of “The\nSchijnberg—Gotta Family” : “If I were to fix on one quality\nas especially characteristic of her, it would be truth—\ntruth of perception, which rested on entire truthfulness\nof character. She was true to the core in mind and\nheart. True, because she was clear-sighted, candid to\nacknowledge difﬁculties in thought or memory, and\ntherefore tolerant to differences of thought ; true, because\nin practice no shadow of self-interest ever dimmed her\nperception of what was just, or ever made her swerve\nfrom what she felt to be truest and noblest; true,\nbecause she hated exaggerations —‘ the falsehood of\nextremes’;——- true, because she was ‘a woman of a\nas those who knew her longest, and\n\n’\n\nsteadfast heart,\nthrough most vicissitudes, best knew.”\n\n[P.T.o.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n2\n\nNow let us read, in her own words, her view of\nVivisection from the standpoint of morality :-——\n\nIn reading the late correspondence between the advo-\ncates and the opponents of Vivisecti-on in The Timesﬁ“ it\nhas struck me that our friends sometimes weaken their own\ncause by bringing the chief weight of their argument to\nbear on the question whether the discoveries made by the\n“savage science,” as it has been well called, have really\nled to results which have done good service in curing or\nalleviating disease. The sharp discussion which has taken\nplace over the case of the poor man whose life was not\nsaved by an operation for brain disease, shows that the\nVivisectionists are not very amply provided with examples\neven on their side.\n\nBut is not this unsafe ground to take in arguing with\nthem? It amounts to a practical acknowledgment that if\na certain number of successful cases, resulting from their\npractice, could be found, the victory must be yielded to\nthem.\n\nNow, it seems to me that the ground that conscientious,\nnot to say God—fearing people should take, is this: Even\ngranting the results to be as productive of advantage as\ntheir most zealous advocates would contend, still we have\nno right to take an immoral course to obtain them.\n\nIt is on this ground we now blame the advocates of\nthe Inquisition. They took precisely the position in question.\nThey probably honestly believed that the doctrines, the\nspread of which they opposed, would do greater harm to\nmen’s souls than the most deadly disease to their bodies;\nand they honestly thought the best way to stop the spread\nof these opinions was their system of secret spies, torture,\nand execution of obstinate offenders. Of course in our\nenlightened days few would admit either of these premises;\n\nbut even granting them—granting that the use of reason\n\nand intelligence produced deadly harm, and that the rack\nand the dungeon were the most effectual remedy, should\nwe now admit that they were right in what they did? No,\n\nwe should say no possible good in the end could justify\nsuch means.\n\n \n\n* “Brain Surgery.”~—1884.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\nIt is quite conceivable, now, that we might stop some\ndangerous conspiracies against the safety of the whole\ncommunity by opening letters, breaking locks, and sending\nspies right and left into private houses; but we hold that\nexcept in cases where, so to speak, war has been declared,\nand fair warning given, such means would be unlawful.\nIn short, those whose standard of rectitude is high, agree\nthat immoral means must never be allowed, even for the\nbest ends. On this ground, then, the enemies of Vivisection\nmay entrench themselves, and no opponent can dislodge\nthem.\n\nAnd if it be objected to this, that we are thereby\ngiving up all hopes of making valuable discoveries in\ncertain departments of science, we may conﬁdently reply\nthat cutting off one unlawful way of attaining our object\nwill not shut out other ways of gaining it: quite the\ncontrary. If necessity is the mother of invention we may\nalso affirm that nothing quickens the intelligence, or stimu-\nlates the search for resources, like a stern and consistent\nallegiance to duty. He who will not take a crooked way\nto his goal will search till he ﬁnds a straight way, and he\nwill ﬁnd it is the best after all. The easiest way is\ncommonly the immmoral one. The simplest way for a\npoor man to satisfy his hunger is to steal; but if he is\nresolved he will not use the unlawful way, he will look\nout for lawful ones, and probably ﬁnd better ones. The\nsimplest way for a Government to get money is that\nof the Asiatic despots, by wholesale robbery and violence;\nbut a just ruler will study and labour to attain the end\nrightfully. And so those who resolve once for all that\nnone but humane and lawful means shall be used for\nphysiological discoveries, will, if they intelligently and\nheartily set to work, ﬁnd means to attain their object,\nand probably better and more reliable means. Close\nobservation of living subjects may prove more effective\nthan cruelties to creatures of another class. I believe\nit will be found here, as in other cases, that where\nthe righteous way is ﬁrst sought, “‘ all these things will\n. be added to us.”\n\n \n\n“ Guardian” General Printing Works, Manchester, Reddish, and London.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "\n",
    "According to [David Blei](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/topicmodeling.html), topic models are a \"suite of algorithms that uncover the hidden thematic structure in document collections.\" Topic models operate on the idea that for any given document collection, or corpus, there is a finite number of themes, or topics, from which the corpus draws and each document is composed of words that are associated with some number of those topics. While we don't necessarily think of an author simply dipping into buckets (topics) of words and putting them together to create a document, it's turned out to be a useful model for understanding collections of documents according to the themes that cut across the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are quite a few types of topic models, but we'll focus on one of the most common forms: latent dirichlet allocation (LDA). LDA topic modeling is a form of unsupervised machine learning, wherein we provide an unlabeled corpus of texts to the algorithm, which then produces the model, though we often provide the number of topics that the algorithm should use for the model. While there are processes for determining the \"correct\" number of topics, many consider this part of topic modeling a bit of an art that is determined as much by the research questions of the person running the model as it is by the corpus and model. Other types of topic models highlight different aspects and problematics of types of corpora, such as temporal differentiation and author bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "A topic model gives us a number of data objects. We'll have a list of topics, which are distributions over terms, though we could think of topics somewhat simply as sets of regularly co-occuring terms. We'll also have a representation of each document in the corpus as a vector denoting the composition of the document according to the topics, that is, we'll have an account of how much of each document is associated with each topic. \n",
